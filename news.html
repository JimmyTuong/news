I&#39;ve been going through, as some people know, I&#39;ve been going through an overly complicated move, which has finally wrapped itself up. And you&#39;ve been doing a lot of international traveling, which, as people can see from the background, you&#39;re still doing,<br>but you&#39;re also very close to wrapping up. So it&#39;s great to be back and talking. And I think one thing that&#39;s very topical at the moment is what&#39;s going on in L.A., the L.A. riots. And, you know, you and I had hypothesized or that&#39;s kind of a weak word. We had discussed that, hey, when everything was going great, be wary because it&#39;s going to change. And it was very clear that sort of the deep state that Trump&#39;s opponents were already preparing for a multitude of different riots, insurrections across the country, et cetera. And they had gone so far as to target the Insurrection Act in advance.<br>And they still are to try and limit his ability to do anything about that. So, well, now here we are. And it&#39;s been, I don&#39;t know how many days, four days, three days of riots in L.A. And, you know, it appears that that&#39;s going to continue, although Trump is now going to be bringing some forces to bear.<br>So with that, I&#39;ll turn it over to you and we&#39;ll get this thing going.<br>Go After the Organizers<br>by Jeff Carlson &amp; Hans Mahncke - Jun 10, 2025<br>In this episode of Truth Over News, we cover the LA riots, specifically the growing awareness that these events aren’t organic. More and more people see them for what they are: funded and organized operations, often backed by groups that may even be receiving taxpayer money. That’s the clear takeaway from the USAID scandal. So if there’s any hope of stopping this cycle, going after the immediate perpetrators isn’t enough. We have to go after the funders and organizers behind them.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R2" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">3</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/10/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">“LẦN NÀY KHÁC TRƯỚC!...”<br>Vụ bạo động tại Los Angeles nguy hiểm hơn các lần trước!

This one felt like it could be the prelude to something even worse.<br>(By Leighton Woodhouse - The Free Press - 06.09.25 - U.S. Politics)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>LOS ANGELES — About three hours into the third day of the immigration protests in downtown Los Angeles, a dozen or so protesters started breaking up large rocks lining the gap between the street and an off-ramp and hurling them onto the 101 Freeway below. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) had closed the southbound side after protesters had tried to seize it. Police cars and SUVs were parked there, and they were getting pummeled by the rocks. As one officer drove away, a rock smashed the police car’s windshield. (You can watch some of this scene in a video by The Free Press’s Austyn Jeffs here.)<br>This went on for at least an hour. I didn’t see anyone get arrested.<br>When one of the rock-throwing protesters saw me taking pictures, he ordered me to delete the ones that showed anyone who was unmasked. “We’ll fuck you up,” he threatened. I deleted them; he gave me a fist bump.<br>Rocks weren’t the only projectiles. I saw protesters tossing commercial-grade fireworks at the police, which sounded like bombs. Between the fireworks and the flash-bangs, there was a concussive explosion about once a minute.<br>I have been to dozens of mass protests like the one that exploded in Los Angeles on Friday. What I saw in Los Angeles on Sunday was different. It felt like it could be the prelude to something even worse.<br>Even before the rocks started flying, the police were responding to protesters who were throwing benign projectiles like empty plastic water bottles by firing rubber bullets and flash-bangs directly at them.<br>“They were shooting randomly,” said protester Louis Gallardo from Dallas, showing me a massive welt on his rib cage from being struck by a rubber bullet. He said the police pulled a woman he was with out of the crowd and arrested her.<br>A man I spoke to pointed out that those rocks were big enough to kill people. They were.<br>What I saw didn’t seem random at all. CHP officers were methodically picking out targets through their gun scopes and firing less-lethal munitions at them.<br>When I arrived downtown late Sunday afternoon, tens of thousands of protesters occupied about eight square blocks above the closed 101 Freeway. Helicopters soared overhead. A Waymo in a line of Waymo taxis was engulfed in bonfire-size flames, a massive plume of black smoke clogging the sky above it. The others were smashed and covered in graffiti. Within an hour, they would all be on fire.<br>“I’m not really into politics,” Daniel Flores, a young protester from Los Angeles, told me. “But in this situation, it affects my family, and it affects everyone that I love. So I have to get involved somehow.”<br>The usual choreography of these protests goes something like this: Thousands of normal people show up, along with a smaller contingent of organized agitators. The agitators engage in enough petty property damage to create a situation in which there is a standoff with the cops. Under the cover of the crowd, they then engage in more serious property destruction. If they are emboldened enough, these agitators might launch some largely symbolic attacks on police lines: throwing trash, vandalizing an unattended police cruiser, that kind of thing.<br>If the strategy is successful, it provokes a violent reaction from the police that is directed at the general mass of protesters. The experience of being attacked by the police when you haven’t done anything illegal outrages the nonviolent majority of the crowd, which then becomes incrementally more violent in return. The situation escalates.<br>Sunday did not follow that script.<br>Though the rock-throwing protesters were masked, they did not have the telltale signs of being antifa types. They weren’t clad in black with anarchist patches safety-pinned to their hoodies. They carried no flags or shields. They were not predominantly white.<br>They also weren’t incrementally ratcheting up their activity. They had escalated straight into serious violence.<br>Several protesters I spoke to were strongly opposed to the rock-throwing. One woman cursed out a man who had thrown some kind of smoke canister at the police below. A man I spoke to pointed out that those rocks were big enough to kill people. They were.<br>Late in the afternoon, police reopened the northbound side of the 101. While protesters and cops hurled rocks and fired munitions at one another, civilian traffic zoomed by on the opposite side. There was an endless cascade of honks in support of the protesters. It is quite obvious that the public here deplores the recent immigration raids. But it seemed like only dumb luck that one of the rocks or fireworks didn’t land in the honking traffic.<br>The right is describing the protests as a violent “insurrection.” The left wants to portray them as largely peaceful. Many in the middle might assume that both portrayals are correct: Generally peaceful demonstrations are being hijacked by extremists and criminal elements.<br>The immigrant communities here, legal and illegal, generally are not seen as an occupying army of foreigners. They are largely taken for granted by most Californians as part of the social fabric.<br>The reality is that no protest is ever just one thing. I saw people who aimed to injure or even kill police officers, and who would have been happy to instigate massive civil unrest. This faction seemed to be outnumbered, though, by those who looked at what they were doing with disapproval but were powerless to stop it.<br>While I saw only a small sliver of what has happened across Los Angeles during the past four days, almost all of the people I spoke to told me they are angry and scared about the raids. “What is he doing sending ICE out into elementary schools?” a woman who said her first name was Dulca asked me about President Trump.<br>“I’m seeing lots of people my age out here protesting for their parents,” Ignacio Vazquez, a 30-year-old amateur photographer who grew up in South Central Los Angeles, told me.<br>I have lived in California for more or less my entire life. I have covered immigration here. Despite the national outrage over mass illegal immigration during the Biden presidency, things do not feel noticeably different in Los Angeles or the Bay Area from how they have for decades. The immigrant communities here, legal and illegal, generally are not seen as an occupying army of foreigners. They are largely taken for granted by most Californians as part of the social fabric, no more alien than people who moved here from the East Coast.<br>The demonstrations are ugly, but so is what precipitated them. I asked Dulca what it feels like to live in Los Angeles these days. I expected her to say she was terrified, but instead she pointed to the protests. “Everyone in LA is coming together,” she said.<br>That may be true. But it also felt like a bomb ready to explode.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R3" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">4</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/10/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">THÊM MỘT TIN NÓNG!<br>Michael Ramirez vừa hý họa nạn kỳ thị Do Thái thì con cá sấu đã xuất hiện tại… London!

There was “a fringe element” responsible for vandalism and unrest, she said.  <br>Earlier Monday, the U.S. military announced the deployment of roughly 700 Marines to the L.A. area to protect federal buildings and personnel.<br>Even as the Marines deployed, there were signs that the military force in L.A. might soon expand further. Over the weekend, President Trump ordered 2,000 National Guardsmen to the city. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a social-media post Monday night that an additional 2,000 were being mobilized. If all the troops quickly deploy, the force in the city would approach 5,000 troops. <br>On Monday night, the U.S. Northern Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations in North America, said about 1,700 National Guard troops were now in greater L.A. <br>The unusual decision to deploy active-duty troops marks the first time in more than three decades that Marines have been sent into a U.S. city to address civil unrest.<br>The move came over the objections of California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has called the federal intervention an intrusion on state sovereignty and sued in response. “They shouldn’t be deployed on American soil facing their own countrymen to fulfill the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial President,” Newsom wrote in a message on X. Later​ Monday night, he said he would file a lawsuit to prevent the Marines from being deployed​.<br>Protestor wrapped in an American flag during a Los Angeles immigration protest.<br>A demonstrator near a police line during protests in Los Angeles.

Officers used their shields to advance in a line and pushed the crowd back.<br>Thousands of people also gathered for a rally organized by the California chapter of the Service Employees International Union to call for the release of its president, David Huerta.<br>Rally attendees, many wearing union shirts, chanted “They come for one, they come for us all,” and “Todos somos Huerta,” or “We are all Huerta” in Spanish. There was little police presence at the event.<br>Protestors holding signs at a demonstration against ICE raids.<br>Protesters gather outside a federal building in downtown Los Angeles.

ICE said it made more than 100 arrests last week in the area.<br>Despite Newsom’s public insistence that the situation was stabilizing, Trump ordered National Guardsmen to Los Angeles on Saturday night, ignoring the governor’s warnings that an uninvited federal deployment was “purposefully inflammatory” and risked escalating tensions. <br>Trump, who won his re-election campaign on a pledge to crack down on illegal immigration, has embraced fights with Democrats who have said his tactics go beyond his constitutional limits. <br>Police officers in riot gear respond to protests at night.<br>Police engage protesters in Los Angeles. Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images<br>Though U.S. officials have said the role of the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles will be limited, the broad nature of the order has spurred concerns that it could also be laying the foundations for future military actions against protesters elsewhere in the country. <br>National Guard troops are part-time soldiers assigned to a state and are usually under the governor’s authority. Active-duty troops answer solely to the commander in chief and their focus is on defending the U.S. <br>Details around the Marines’ deployment were unclear, including how long they would be in the city, what kind of weapons they are authorized to carry and what their specific orders are.<br>Meanwhile, Newsom said that more than 800 additional state and local law-enforcement officers from nearby counties would be sent to Los Angeles to help quell the protests and “clean up President Trump’s mess.”<br>The Los Angeles Unified School District said it was taking steps to protect students and their families from immigration authorities during graduation ceremonies planned for Tuesday. School police would establish “perimeters of safety” around graduations to try to block federal agents, avoid lines into venues to keep people off the street and provide online options to watch graduations, district superintendent Alberto Carvalho said.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R5" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">6</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/9/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">HOA KỲ LẠI THẤY NỘI CHIẾN TRONG GIA PHẢ!<br>Nước Mỹ là kết quả của một phát minh tuyệt vời trên một lãnh thổ trời cho là vuông vức, để thành một siêu cường, khiến bao người chỉ muốn là người Mỹ.

He ordered 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles County. Meanwhile, Governor Gavin Newsom reacted in fury. “We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved,” Newsom posted on X. He plans to sue.<br>One lesson is clear: Illegal immigration is the focal point of our age. And it has the potential to break the nation apart.<br>America’s federalist system mediates differences among the states. But when state and federal government collide over fundamental questions - slavery, civil rights, immigration - the forces unleashed can overwhelm the entire constitutional structure.<br>The places where federal and state governments most diverge have been sites of polarization, struggle, and violence. And the federal government always wins.<br>Take the Nullification Crisis, for example. In 1828 Congress hiked tariffs, benefiting Northern manufacturers and harming Southern tobacco farmers. The law became known as the Tariff of Abominations. In response, Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina wrote an anonymous argument for a state’s ability to nullify federal law.<br>The places where federal and state governments most diverge have been sites of polarization, struggle, and violence. And the federal government always wins.<br>Andrew Jackson, one of Trump’s populist forebears, was sworn into office the next year. Calhoun was his vice president. Though Jackson was also a Southerner, he made his loyalties known. “Our Union,” he said on Jefferson’s birthday in 1830, “it must be preserved.”<br>Congress passed another tariff in 1832. It contained no relief for the South. Hostilities escalated. South Carolina’s governor organized an armed resistance. Jackson proclaimed that nullification was treason. Fighting was about to start when Congress brokered a compromise. The federal legislature lowered tariffs; South Carolina repealed nullification.<br>The crisis involved the two most combustible issues in nineteenth-century America: protectionism and slavery. It was a prelude to decades of sectional strife and hurried compromise. The precedent was set for the Civil War - the ultimate test of federal versus state power.<br>Jefferson Davis would restate Calhoun’s arguments when he resigned his U.S. Senate seat in January 1861 and was elected president of the Confederacy the following month. The war that broke out in April 1861 pitted the Union against Confederacy over slavery. The Union won, of course - but at great cost.<br>The bitter entanglement of federalism and economic and moral disputes continued into the twentieth century. When the Supreme Court ruled against segregated schools in 1954, white Southerners pledged “massive resistance” to federally mandated desegregation. In 1957, Democratic governor Orval Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard to stop the Little Rock Nine from entering Central High School. President Dwight Eisenhower sent in the 101st Airborne Division.<br>“If the use of local police powers had been sufficient, our traditional method of leaving the problems in those hands would have been pursued,” Eisenhower said in a televised address. “But when large gatherings of obstructionists made it impossible for the decrees of the Court to be carried out, both the law and the national interest demanded that the president take action.”<br>On “Bloody Sunday” - March 7, 1965 - state and local police attacked a civil rights march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital in Montgomery. Scores were injured, including a 25-year-old John Lewis.<br>Martin Luther King Jr. soon planned another march along the same route. But Alabama governor George Wallace refused to deploy the National Guard, putting the marchers’ safety in doubt. President Lyndon B. Johnson, outraged at his fellow Democrat, sent in the troops. Some 25,000 people completed the journey. A few months later, Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law.<br>Like his predecessors, Donald Trump justifies his actions on the basis of federal supremacy and state officials’ failure to maintain order. California disregards immigration law with impunity. Its leaders could not stop last weekend’s violence.<br>Consequently, Trump exercised national prerogatives over state and local interests. That is part of the reason America has a president. His language - “ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!” - may be less diplomatic than, say, Eisenhower’s. But his authority is the same.<br>Now it’s Gavin Newsom, progressive hero, who has adopted the rhetoric of states’ rights. “This is a serious breach of state sovereignty - inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed,” he wrote on X. “Rescind the order. Return control to California.”<br>That is unlikely to happen, of course - about as unlikely as Newsom acknowledging he now shares George Wallace’s attitude toward federal power.<br>There is a difference, however. Tacitly in 1832 and explicitly in 1957 and 1965, national sovereignty promoted human equality. Today, in the case of illegal immigration, national sovereignty and postmodern concepts of human rights run against one another. The left cheers federal power when it comes to electric vehicles and vaccine mandates. But mention secure borders, and it discovers its inner Calhoun.<br>These issues - nullification, civil rights, and illegal immigration - put strain on the federal system because they implicate fundamental values. How you feel about them cuts to the heart of your worldview. They involve questions of state power, human dignity, and the meaning of citizenship. They pose, as conservative scholar Willmoore Kendall once wrote, “a question that the American people must answer in order to know themselves as the kind of people they are, in order to achieve their mission in history, their responsibility under God - so, at least in those days, they would have put it - for the kind of political and social order they were to create and maintain in history.”<br>One lesson is clear: Illegal immigration is the focal point of our age. And it has the potential to break the nation apart.<br>The progressive idea of human rights no longer recognizes borders - but without them, national sovereignty is meaningless. President Trump, by contrast, elevates the traditional rights of American citizens above universalist progressive ideals. That is why he so often comes into conflict with California, whose monolithically liberal officials proudly extol their state as the exemplar of progressive idealism.<br>Lost amid the chaos that enveloped Los Angeles was news that the Trump administration is planning to withhold federal grants to California for violating Title IX by allowing biological men to participate in women’s sports. Here, too, Newsom will likely argue for states’ rights against federal rule of law.<br>Trump is positioned to win these debates. Article VI, Section II of the U.S. Constitution says that federal law “shall be the supreme law of the land.” And public opinion supports him: Outrage at illegal immigration fueled his rise to power - twice. His job approval has bounced back from April’s “Liberation Day” lows. Immigration is his strongest issue. Social disorder benefits the right.<br>Just don’t expect a quick resolution. Illegal immigration and woke ideology are entrenched in large parts of America. And federalism is too important a piece of our constitutional architecture to discard, even when it defends the indefensible.<br>What happened in Los Angeles wasn’t the culmination of the fight over illegal immigration. It was another act in an unending constitutional drama. Word came Monday afternoon that 700 Marines have been deployed to L.A. to protect federal buildings. Trump has law, precedent, and politics on his side. But ideology dies hard. And more clashes are coming.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R6" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">7</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/9/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">GIỠN MẶT NHÀ CẦM ĐỒ? – CẦM TÙ LÀ CÁI CHẮC!<br>FBI đã nhận diện hung thủ đeo mặt nạ khi phạm tội ở Los Angeles.

People will always want a great choice at great prices.<br>For investors, thinking about what won’t change is a shortcut to finding great moneymaking opportunities.<br>And the one thing I know for sure that’s here to stay is Uncle Sam’s spending habits.<br>I had high hopes for Elon Musk’s DOGE and the energy around getting Washington “fit.”<br>But the US government’s spending plan for the next year - aka the “Big Beautiful Bill” - just passed the House. Now, it’s moving to the Senate. If it gets voted through, it’ll add another $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.<br>We can debate whether this is good, bad, or ugly another time. But we’re investors. Our job is to make money. And if all this debt gets you down, I have good news. Here’s the easiest way to make money from Uncle Sam’s spending addiction...<br>This isn’t a “Trump” thing.<br>Every president, Republican and Democrat, in my lifetime (and yours) has added to America’s national debt:<br>Source: ABC News<br>All the talk about cutting spending has been just that: talk. Politicians are incentivized to spend other people’s money. And that won’t change any time soon.<br>People have been crying wolf about the US national debt for decades. Remember Henry Ross Perot and his charts back in 1992?<br>Let me say something a little controversial. The amount of debt doesn’t matter. Neither do deficits. What matters is how much you’re paying out in interest to service that debt.<br>Case in point: National debt tripled between 2008 and 2022 and yet interest payments barely budged.<br>Source: Created by ChatGPT<br>This right here is why all the doomers screaming about Uncle Sam going bankrupt were wrong. But as you know, the world of zero interest rates is over. Bad for homebuyers. Really bad for Washington.<br>The US government now pays out roughly $3 billion in interest expenses per day. This year, for the first time ever, we’ll spend more money servicing the national debt than on defense. Not the kind of records I like to see broken.<br>Source: @CharlieBilello on X<br>Interest payments doubled in just four years. At this pace, a third of all tax revenue could go just toward interest payments by the end of the decade. Friends, we’ve hit what they call a “tipping point.”<br>There’s a right and a wrong way to think about this…<br>“Oh, no. America is headed for bankruptcy. Sell everything and hide out in a bunker.” Please don’t be this guy.<br>America can’t go broke because it controls the money printers. Let’s again think about what won’t change. Next time there’s a crisis, politicians will turn the money printers on full blast.<br>Wall Street has a fancy term for this: debasement. And this is why you must own assets.<br>Just like your morning coffee and grocery bill are priced in dollars, so too are stocks, crypto, and gold. When Uncle Sam prints money, it debases the value of the US dollar.<br>USD down, assets up.<br>If you’re sitting in cash, debasement constantly eats away at your hard-earned savings, making them worth less each passing year.<br>The government’s own numbers show the dollar has lost 66% of its value over the past 40 years. A one-way trend if ever I saw one.<br>But it’s a massive tailwind for investors.<br>If you think US government debt is a problem and are concerned about debasement, buy stocks! But that’s not all...<br>“Okay, Stephen. So how should we invest?”<br>Buy assets that politicians can’t print.<br>They can’t make gold out of thin air. <br>This is why the yellow metal has jumped 25% since January and is on track for its best year since 2010.<br>Gold has historically been the go-to hedge against currency debasement. I think everyone should own at least a little gold.<br>But gold isn’t helping you get ahead. It’s just helping you not fall behind. My friend Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor, ran the numbers and found gold has basically been flat in “real” terms since 2009 when compared to how much money we’ve printed:<br>Source: @BittelJulien on X<br>You’ve got to own stocks and…<br>Crypto.<br>Stocks - especially great disruptive businesses like we own in Disruption Investor - have kept pace with debasement and then some. But crypto has been the fastest horse in the race. Bitcoin (BTC) is simply the greatest debasement hedge on the planet. It’s soaked up all the printed money to become the best-performing asset in the history of the world over the past decade.<br>Heck, even gold is down 99.99% compared to bitcoin since 2012!<br>Financial guidance I’d give to my son:<br>First, you’ve gotta own stocks. And son, please just own a little crypto. The great thing is that when you own an asset that can 10X or more in a year, you only have to own a little to make real money.<br>Stephen McBride<br>Chief Analyst, RiskHedge<br>PS: If you want to learn about smart ways to grow and protect your wealth in today’s market environment, regardless of what’s happening in Washington, consider joining The Jolt today.<br>Twice weekly, I publish my best ideas to help everyday investors get ahead of the crowd and profit from the world’s biggest disruptions with lasting staying power.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R8" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">9</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/9/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">HÀI KỊCH CỦA CON RANH VÀ ĐÁM BÚ DÙ!<br>Giữa bao chuyện sinh tử khác, may là có Telegraph tường thuật cho thiên hạ biết...<br>https://www.telegraph.co.uk//world-news/2025/06/09/israel-gaza-war-idf-boards-greta-thunberg-aid-boat/?WT.mc_id=e_DM603444&amp;WT.tsrc=email&amp;etype=Edi_Nhl_New&amp;utmsource=email&amp;utm_medium=Edi_Nhl_New20250609&amp;utm_campaign=DM603444<br>Greta Thunberg will be made to watch footage of Oct 7, say Israelis<br>Key moments - 9 June 2025 • 10:17pm<br>7:21am: UN special rapporteur urges more boats to ‘break the siege’<br>5:20am : Activists to be taken to Israel’s Ashdod port<br>2:25am: Thunberg: ‘We are being kidnapped’<br>Greta Thunberg on Israeli soil after IDF soldiers bought her protest boat to shore<br>Greta Thunberg on Israeli soil after IDF soldiers brought her protest boat to shore Credit: x.com/IsraelMFA<br>Israel’s military has been ordered to show Greta Thunberg footage of Hamas’s Oct 7 2023 attack on southern Israel. <br>Israel Katz, the defence minister, on Monday congratulated the IDF for its interception of an aid boat carrying Ms Thunberg and 11 other activists before it could reach Gaza. <br>After confirming the passengers would be deported back to their home countries once the boat reached the Israeli port of Ashdod, he said he had instructed troops to “show the flotilla passengers the video of the horrors of the October 7 massacre”. <br>Mr Katz said he wanted them to “see exactly who the Hamas terrorist organisation they came to support and for whom they work is, what atrocities they committed against women, the elderly, and children, and against whom Israel is fighting to defend itself”.<br>After the boat, called Madleen, was intercepted, Ms Thunberg said in a pre-recorded video that she had been “kidnapped” by “Israeli occupation forces” but was later pictured smiling as soldiers handed out sandwiches and bottles of water. <br>Activists from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) had set out to protest against Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip and its restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid.<br>Israel’s military used drones to drop a “white irritant substance” on the Gaza-bound aid boat before boarding and detaining the activists near Egypt during the early hours of Monday morning. <br>Pictures from the yacht showed the deck covered in white liquid, which had been sprayed from a drone at around 2am BST, according to the group behind her mission.

She has been charged with smuggling goods into the U.S. and making false statements, according to a federal criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Detroit.<br>From September 2024 through March 2025, prosecutors allege, Han sent four international shipments containing concealed biological materials to individuals affiliated with a University of Michigan lab. The contents were identified as Caenorhabditis elegans - roundworms commonly used in genetic and biomedical research. The packages were mis-manifested and not declared in accordance with U.S. import regulations.<br>On June 8, Han arrived at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on a J-1 visa and was stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. She allegedly denied having sent any biological materials to the U.S. and made false statements about the nature of the shipments. Agents also discovered that content on her electronic device had been deleted three days before her arrival - a detail included in the federal complaint.<br>“In a follow up interview with FBI and ICE HSI agents, Han admitted to sending the packages and lying about their contents,” Patel commented.<br>“The alleged smuggling of biological materials by this alien from a science and technology university in Wuhan, China - to be used at a University of Michigan laboratory - is part of an alarming pattern that threatens our security,” said U.S. Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon, Jr. “The American taxpayer should not be underwriting a PRC-based smuggling operation at one of our crucial public institutions.”<br>The case marks the third time in one week that Chinese nationals connected to the University of Michigan have been charged with allegedly smuggling undeclared biological material from China into the U.S. for laboratory research.<br>On June 3, federal prosecutors charged Yunqing Jian, 33, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan, and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, 34, with conspiracy, smuggling goods into the U.S., false statements, and visa fraud.

There is almost no attention being given to the space; flows are abysmal, and valuation deltas are absurd.  But when it all reverses is anyone’s guess.<br>-   As is generally the case in these types of things, the companies that may prove long-term winners if some resolution to these tariff/trade matters is found are those most adept at proactively passing on tariff impact to customers now, followed by tariff relief later (trade deals, reversals, etc.).  Where that pricing power proves sticky, it results in expanded margins as these things organically play out<br>-   I thought this highlighted the significance of low interest rates in fueling the Mag-7 moment.  The headwind of a normalized rate environment (where we are now) has not been evident in the multiple and stock price action of Mag-7 these last two years, but it has been in employment.  Ultimately, the go-forward realities of many (not all) of these names will prove to be different name by name and case by case (different revenue models, growth strategies, valuations, and more).<br>-   It should be no surprise that the strongest currency action since the trade/tariff issues began are Taiwan (+11% vs. USD), Australia (+7%), Mexico (+7%), South Korea (+5%), the UK (+5%), Euro (+4%), and Canada (+4%).  The muted movement in Chinese Yuan relative to the dollar speaks to the uncertainty around where that trade deal is going.<br>-   Best performer in the S&amp;P 500 the last forty years?  Amgen.  Yes, Apple is second (with a 21.6% annualized return), but Amgen is first with a 22.7% annualized return.  Amgen had a 64% drawdown along the way while Apple had an 83% drawdown.  The AVERAGE drawdown for the top 20 names in the S&amp;P 500 over the last forty years was 72%.  That is simply surreal to me.<br>Top News Stories<br>----------------<br>-   Secretary Bessent, Secretary Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are meeting with Chinese counterparts in London today for additional negotiations towards a U.S.-China trade deal.<br>-   Riots in downtown Los Angeles spiraled out of control Saturday night, provoking the President to send in the National Guard.  At the center of the social unrest are protests against the administration’s efforts regarding illegal immigration.<br>Public Policy<br>-------------<br>-   As we enter crunch time for this “big, beautiful bill,” I have been trying my best to assess what changes are possible at the Senate before it goes back to the House for unified approval.  My working thesis is still that (a) there will be some changes at the Senate, but (b) not enough to dislodge the needed votes for approval.  I’d assign an 80% or so probability to that, which is different than saying it is a slam dunk, but meant to capture the high likelihood that some bill which extends the 2017 tax cuts and does a few other things, while still adding to the national debt, is passed (in July or August).  In trying to assess what might or might not happen at the Senate level, I have talked to my best possible resources on the Hill, including some Senators directly, people in Treasury and the NEC, and have been in heavy communication with those public policy analysts I most trust and respect.  None of this is infallible, but here is a summary of what I think the Senate may do to change the bill, that still maintains needed support (at Senate and House levels, both on an entirely partisan basis):<br>    -   The Senate wants to make 100% business expensing permanent, not just for four years as the House bill does (positive).  This has budget impact, though, so something else will have to give<br>    -   Section 899 (revenge tax on foreign countries, I alluded to in a daily blurb last week) appears to be going in (and the Senate Parliamentarian has now approved it)<br>    -   The Senate wants to lower the House’s SALT deduction limit of $40,000.<br>    -   I hear from some analysts that the Senate wants to kill the Pass-Through Entity Tax deduction (a workaround to SALT for pass-through businesses), but I hear from the NEC and some Senators that they want to preserve the PTET.  The House bill kills it.<br>    -   The Hydrogen Tax Credit that the House killed may end up back in.<br>    -   The university endowment tax will be going up, but perhaps not as much.<br>    -   Some changes to the depth of changes with Medicaid, clean-energy tax credits, and other budget cuts seem inevitable, but which direction is not even clear, let alone the magnitude of such.<br>-   Is the goal of the tariff talks to get lower tariffs across the board?  Senator Kennedy of Louisiana asked Secretary Lutnick if the administration would take a “zero-zero” tariff deal with Vietnam (no tariffs for them, no tariffs for us), and he replied, “absolutely not.”<br>Economic Front<br>--------------<br>-   May Jobs came in at 139,000 for May, a little more than expected but still a pretty weak report.  The unemployment rate stayed at 4.2%.  Prior month revisions were near 100,000, though, offsetting any victory lap about this month’s result.  Manufacturing declined, government declined, but by less than expected, and gains were most pronounced in healthcare.<br>-   The labor force dropped by -0.2%, down to lowest level since December 2022 (62.4%).<br>-   Weekly Jobless Claims were above expectations for the second week in a row (247k and 239k the last two weeks).  The four-week average is creeping higher, and I think another week or so here and I will have something else to say about this.<br>-   Top concerns from CEO’s in the most recent Business Council survey of CEO Confidence (Conference Board): (1) Geopolitical instability, (2) Trade and Tariffs, and (3) Regulatory uncertainty.<br>-   China’s consumer prices fell for a fourth consecutive month in May as its deflationary reality continued.<br>Housing &amp; Mortgage<br>------------------<br>-   First-time homebuyers now make up 24% of all home purchases, down from 50% just fifteen years ago (in 2010).  This is really a stunning data point to reinforce the crisis of (un)affordability.<br>-   One of the most fascinating things in the real estate space (speaking more to commercial real estate now than residential housing): There was no theme more universally assumed to be true the last five years than the “death of office.”  Borderline apocalyptic assumptions were baked in around the asset class, often treating it as one monolithic nightmare (with little distinction between Class A and Class C, between Manhattan and Houston and Portland and Nashville, etc.).  Now, a few years later, with some loan “amend and extend” deals done, a few bad deals liquidated, but nothing even near the universe of catastrophic or systemic, no one talks about it anymore.  Some large investors are slowly adding Office back into their portfolios.  Rents are increasing for high-quality office buildings in the most attractive markets.  And the world keeps on turning.  This was always more of a Credit story than anything – how lenders would work out some sub-optimal loan situations – and it was never a systemic change in societal need or function.  Melodrama makes for bad investment policy.<br>Federal Reserve<br>---------------<br>-   The current federal funds rate is 4.25-4.50% (it is always set as a range).  Right now, the futures market for the fed funds rate is pricing in a 7% chance that that rate stays the same through the end of the year.  There is a 30% chance of one rate cut between now and then, a 40% chance of two rate cuts, and a 20% chance of three rate cuts.  Another way to say it is that there is a 60% chance of 2-3 cuts between now and December.<br>Oil and Energy<br>--------------<br>-   WTI Crude closed at $65.34, up +1.18%<br>-   Midstream Energy was up +2% last week, and oil itself was up over +6% last week.  The OPEC announcement last week definitely proved to be less bad than the whisper number (that is, they hiked production by less than expected).  MLPs led the way within midstream.<br>-   Another nine oil rigs have been taken offline over the last week, bringing the total to 42 that have been shut down in the last six weeks.  At 442 active rigs, that is the lowest since October 2021.  Both OPEC+ and U.S. producers seem to be talking about more production, but with market forces not actually allowing for more production.<br>-   Over 70% of the Energy Sector is now above its 50-day moving average.<br>Glossary<br>--------<br>-   Twin deficits – this expression refers to the tandem of our trade deficit and our budget deficit.  The trade deficit is simply the difference between our imports and exports (that difference is even out with what we call “cash” – we pay for stuff).  The budget deficit is the difference between government revenues and government expenditures.  The two things have little to do with each other, yet are stewed in the same pot rhetorically often, generally for propaganda or rhetorical benefit.<br>Ask TBG<br>-------<br>“If you were to add one more thing to the pro-growth part of your policy proposals in Dave-land to deal with the national debt, what would it be?”<br>~ J.

The American legal system, when it comes to plaintiff suits, is completely and totally out of control; it is undermining growth (not to mention justice) and might very well represent the lowest-hanging fruit in our economy for reallocating resources to more productive use.  The money spent by big and small companies defending against and/or settling patently absurd and frivolous cases (or threats of litigation) is unfathomable, and it is not just a legal and ethical issue – it is an economic one.

He had an opportunity to set himself up as a Democrat willing to take on the factions of his own coalition when their methods go from peaceful protest to setting fires in the streets, destroying property and all-out anti-cop violence. He could have taken a stand for law and order, taking flak from his own side for standing up for the law-abiding citizens of California.<br>Instead, he blew it. He called the decision by President Trump to deploy the National Guard “an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act,” and announced a lawsuit against the government over the issue. He laid the problem entirely at the feet of President Trump: “He’s exacerbated the conditions. He’s lit the proverbial match. He’s putting fuel on this fire,” Newsom told NBC. “Donald Trump needs to pull back. He needs to stand down. Donald Trump is inflaming these conditions. This is Donald Trump’s problem right now, and if he can’t solve it, we will.”<br>Newsom’s response is laughably out of touch. His regrets in the NBC interview weren’t for people whose property was destroyed, or for cops and ICE agents being targeted just for doing their jobs, but for the meta-narrative the violence played into. “They’re just playing right into Donald Trump’s hand,” Newsom mourned. Even if we could have guessed that’s what really matters to the slick politician from San Francisco, he didn’t need to just go out and say it.<br>Democratic unwillingness to take on the sacred cows of their party in big blue cities and states across the country has become an obvious anchor on their hopes for political comeback. They are unwilling to take on their pro-Hamas faction, their trans men in girls’ sports faction and their pro-illegal migrant faction in any serious way. Newsom can pay lip service to these ideas – but that’s all it is.<br>Until this changes – until someone prominent within the party is willing to set out on a different path – Democrats are going to continue to find their most extreme wing giving President Trump one chaotic gift after another, casting him as the champion of law, order, and normalcy. Whatever that approach is, it is not the path to political victory.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R13" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">14</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/9/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">NHẬN ĐỊNH TUYỆT VỜI VỀ KINH TẾ: TRUMP CŨNG SÁNG DẠ!<br>Thẩm định của Bethany McLean trên The Free Press về vụ Nippon Steel mua US Steel cuối cùng lại được Trump đồng ý làm chúng ta từ nay nên tìm đọc các bài viết của Bethany về kinh doanh...<br>https://www.thefp.com/.../the-nippon-steel-working-class...<br>The Nippon Steel Deal: A Master Class in Winning the Working Class<br>Donald Trump arrives to speak during a visit to a U.S. Steel facility in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, on May 30, 2025. (Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)<br>In opposing the merger of U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, Joe Biden was playing politics. But in doing so, he handed Donald Trump an easy victory.<br>(By Bethany McLean - The Free Press - 06.09.25 - Tech and Business)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Northern Minnesota’s Iron Range is named for the economic activity that built the area and defines its landscape - mining for taconite, a key ingredient in steel. Growing up there in the 1980s, a few things were constant. There were going to be weeks in the winter when the temperature never got above zero. There would be strikes at the mines, and many of my friends’ fathers would be temporarily out of work. Driving a Japanese car - when imported Japanese steel was the bogeyman - was an invitation to abuse. And the area, hardcore union territory, would always vote Democratic.<br>But in 2016, the Iron Range voted for Donald Trump by a narrow margin, making him the first Republican to carry the area since the 1930s. By 2024, it wasn’t even a question. “Iron Range emphatically realigns its politics,” read a headline in the local press.<br>Then, the other morning, my hometown paper, the Mesabi Tribune, wrote about the merger between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, with Nippon set to enter into a partnership with U.S. Steel. During the presidential campaign, Trump, like former president Joe Biden, had opposed it. That is, until he seemingly changed his mind last month. (The deal is currently scheduled to close on June 18.)<br>On the surface, this was surprising news. Here was Trump, an economic nationalist, greenlighting the sale of a strategically important U.S. company to a foreign firm. The decision is even more notable given that Trump had opposed the sale during the election campaign. And yet, my first thought was, The Iron Range will never vote Democratic again.<br>By signing off on the merger last month, Trump thus reinforced the idea that there is one party on the side of the working class - and it’s not the Democrats.<br>At a rally at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania at the end of May, steelworkers, some wearing MAGA merchandise, celebrated. Among the billions Nippon Steel has promised to invest in U.S. Steel, $800 million is earmarked for the Iron Range. “At the rally, I told the steelworkers that I represent the Range and they cheered,” Rep. Pete Stauber, a Minnesota Republican, told me. “They understand that northern Minnesota and Pittsburgh and these other steelmaking towns are linked.”<br>Many U.S. Steel employees always understood that a deal with Nippon Steel was their best hope. But the United Steelworkers union hierarchy opposed it, so Biden did, too. It was a purely political calculation; he wanted the union’s support during the election. By signing off on the merger last month, Trump thus reinforced the idea that there is one party on the side of the working class - and it’s not the Democrats.<br>The saga of the U.S. Steel sale began back in 2023, when the mining giant Cleveland-Cliffs made an unsolicited offer to buy the troubled steelmaker. Then, Nippon stepped in with a slightly higher bid, which U.S. Steel accepted. In March of 2024, however, Biden rejected the deal. “It is important that we maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers,” he said at the time.<br>Sure, yes, sounds great. But given U.S. Steel’s financial problems, without a deal, there weren’t going to be any strong American steel companies left. China had become the world’s biggest steelmaker, and its exports were undercutting prices around the world. U.S. Steel was in a deep, and seemingly irreversible, decline.<br>There’s not much doubt that Biden (and then Kamala Harris) opposed the deal to curry favor with the union brass. But given the severity of U.S. Steel’s problems, why was United Steelworkers opposed? Union officials cited national security concerns, complained that they weren’t consulted, and accused Nippon of bad practices, like steel dumping. Aaron Brown, a Minnesota Star Tribune columnist who lives on the Range, said he thinks the real explanation might be that the union historically had bad blood with U.S. Steel, and would have preferred a deal with Cleveland-Cliffs, with whom it had good relations.<br>Fast-forward to spring of 2025, when the thaw after the brutal Iron Range winter is just setting in. Cleveland-Cliffs, which had bet big on the acquisition of a Canadian steelmaker, Stelco, is now reeling under the weight of the Trump tariffs. It has laid off some 600 workers on the Iron Range. Everyone is scared. At the national level, the United Steelworkers still opposes the Nippon deal - but the rank and file are now openly supporting it.<br>At a meeting at the White House in late May, Stauber and a handful of other federal legislators met with Trump. A day after the meeting, Trump announced a partnership of the two steelmakers. He also announced that he’d raise the tariffs on imported steel to 50 percent from 25 percent.<br>The new Nippon deal that Trump has now approved appears to be the exact same deal Nippon proposed two years ago. (There’s discussion of a “golden share,” which purports to give the U.S. government certain rights, but no one knows what that will actually mean in practice.) In other words, this isn’t a triumph of Trump’s negotiating abilities. It’s just an about-face. But this was the right decision all along, particularly for the workers everyone claims to care about. “We’re talking about thousands of union jobs,” said Spencer Igo - who represents Hibbing and other Range towns in Minnesota’s House, and in 2022 became the first Republican ever to chair the Iron Range Resources &amp; Rehabilitation Board, an economic development agency that is a measure of political power. “It’s the shot in the arm the region needs.”<br>By playing politics instead of allowing a sensible deal, Biden and the Democrats handed Trump an easy win. “We were all just witness to a game of corporate chess,” said Brown. “The Democrats, Biden, and Cleveland-Cliffs all lost. And it will rebound to the benefit of Trump.” Just listen to Nippon’s Steel’s vice chairman, Takahiro Mori, at that Pennsylvania rally: “We would not be here today without President Trump, who has secured the company’s future by approving our partnership,” he said.<br>“We were all just witness to a game of corporate chess.” —Aaron Brown, Minnesota Star Tribune columnist<br>The Iron Range is a proud place. I went back last summer to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of my high school, which was built for $4 million in 1924 - “Mining Town High School Splendid as a Cathedral” was The New York Times headline - a testament to the Range’s money and belief in education. Today, people want jobs and respect. “These miners want to keep working and will literally support anyone or anything who will help them do that,” said Brown. There’s a widespread feeling that wealthy, urban Minnesota, and the Democrats who increasingly represent them, have lost touch. Last summer, a group of us started talking politics at a local bar. “They want us to serve their sandwiches,” the bartender told me, about Democrats from the Twin Cities.<br>“I saw the change firsthand,” Igo told me. “The modern Democratic Party doesn’t include the natural resource industry. We’ve stayed the same. The parties have changed.” Both he and Brown said that a crystallizing moment came in 2020, when two DFL state senators from the Range quit the party to become independents. (DFL refers to the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, Minnesota’s version of the Democratic Party.) “It was the clear signal that the Democratic Party has left the Iron Range,” said Igo. Then came the 2024 election, in which Democrats got wiped off the map. “The transformation is still happening,” said Stauber. “People understand the Republicans are the party of the middle class, of working people.”<br>Of course, it’s not at all clear that Nippon’s investment is going to solve the Range’s problems. As Brown points out, the money may well be used to automate more jobs. There may be no going back to the Iron Range of old, where a high school graduate could build a stable life for their family by going straight to a job in the mines, with decent pay, great schools, and a cabin on one of northern Minnesota’s many lakes. But at this micro level, one party is making it look like they’re at least trying. As they say, all politics is local.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R14" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">15</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/9/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">GIỮA BAO BUỒN BỰC, <br>THƯƠNG TIẾC VĂN SĨ CÓ TÀI...

Many of those drugs are still on the market - despite evidence they offer no benefit and may even be harmful.<br>The probe, based on internal FDA documents, court records, and more than 100 interviews, found that 73% of drugs approved from 2013 to 2022 failed to meet all four of the FDA’s own foundational standards used to assess safety and effectiveness. These criteria include the use of control groups, clinical endpoints, blinding, and replication of results in more than one trial. The report did not evaluate any vaccines.<br>Among the findings:<br>* Cancer drugs were the worst offenders. Only 2.4% of the 123 cancer drugs approved met all the agency’s criteria, while 29 met none. The FDA approved 81% of them based only on preliminary data.<br>* Pharmaceutical companies often relied on surrogate outcomes, such as tumor shrinkage, instead of proven clinical benefits like extended survival or reduced symptoms.<br>* Avastin, a drug approved in 2008 to treat metastatic breast cancer, is a notable example. After five trials showed no clinical benefit - and revealed serious risks like blood clots, heart issues, and kidney problems - the FDA pulled its approval in 2011. Drugmakers lashed out at the agency and patients, discouraging further withdrawals since.<br>The FDA’s loosening of standards can be traced back to the AIDS crisis, when pressure from activists and the pharmaceutical industry led to the creation of the “accelerated approval pathway” in 1992. This allowed approvals based on limited early data. Congress later codified this in the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which was accompanied by a surge in pharmaceutical campaign contributions.<br>Critics argue this shift turned the public into test subjects, with insurers and taxpayers footing the bill while pharmaceutical companies collect profits. An estimated 128,000 Americans die each year from side effects of prescription drugs that were prescribed as directed.<br>The Lever also created a searchable database showing how many drugs approved from 2013 to 2022 meet FDA criteria. Vaccines are not included in that database. According to Children’s Health Defense Senior Research Scientist Karl Jablonowski, vaccine trials often fall short of these same standards - using improper placebos, inadequate blinding, and endpoints that fail to measure real-world protection.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R17" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">18</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/9/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">KHI GIÁO SƯ TURLEY DÙNG SÚNG HAI NÒNG, BẮN ĐẠN GHÉM…<br>Hệ thống chính trị Hoa Kỳ cứ giỡn chơi với pháp luật nên gây bạo động khiến giáo sư luật khoa sáng suốt như Jonathan Turley phải một ngày lâm trận hai lần.

Another round of court challenges are unfolding, but the escalation is likely to continue on both sides. While the Guard’s motto is “Always Ready, Always There!,” California Democrats do not want them between rioters and federal law enforcement.<br>Here is the column:<br>Gov. Gavin Newsom was in his element this week. After scenes of burning cars and attacks on ICE personnel, Newsom declared that this was all “an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.” No, he was not speaking of the attacks on law enforcement or property. He was referring to President Donald Trump’s call to deploy the National Guard to protect federal officers. [Ác liệt!]<br>Newsom is planning to challenge the deployment as cities like Glendale are cancelling contracts to house detainees and reaffirming that local police will not assist the federal government.<br>Trump has the authority under Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code to deploy the National Guard if the president is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”<br>The Administration is saying that that is precisely what is unfolding in California, where mobs attack vehicles and trap federal personnel.<br>Most critics are challenging the deployment on policy grounds, arguing that it is an unnecessary escalation. However, even critics like Berkeley Law Dean Erwin have admitted that “Unfortunately, President Trump likely has the legal authority to do this.”<br>There is a fair debate over whether this is needed at this time, but the President is allowed to reach a different conclusion. Trump wants the violence to end now as opposed to escalating as it did in the Rodney King riots [1992] or the later riots after the George Floyd killings (2020, 2022 rồi 2024!) causing billions in property damage and many deaths.<br>Courts will be asked to halt the order because it did not technically go through Newsom to formally call out the National Guard.<br>Section 12406 grants Trump the authority to call out the Guard and employs a mandatory term for governors, who “shall” issue the President’s order. In the memo, Trump also instructed federal officials “to coordinate with the Governors of the States and the National Guard Bureau.”<br>Newsom is clearly refusing to issue the orders or coordinate the deployment.<br>Even if such challenges are successful, Trump can clearly flood the zone with federal authority. Indeed, the obstruction could escalate the matter further, prompting Trump to consider using the Insurrection Act, which would allow troops to participate directly in civilian law enforcement.<br>In 1958, President Eisenhower used the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to Arkansas to enforce the Supreme Court’s orders ending racial segregation in schools.<br>The Trump Administration has already claimed that these riots “constitute a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” In support of such a claim, the Administration could cite many of the Democratic leaders now denouncing the claim.<br>After January 6th, liberal politicians and professors insisted that the riot was an “insurrection” and, in claiming that Trump and dozens of Republicans could be removed from ballots under the 14th Amendment.<br>Liberals professors insisted that Trump’s use of the word “fight”and questioning the results of an election did qualify as an insurrection. They argued that you merely need to show “an assemblage of people” who are “resisting law” and “using force or intimidation” for “a public purpose.” The involvement of inciteful language from politicians only reinforced these claims. Sound familiar?<br>Democrats are using this order to deflect from their own escalation of the tensions for months. From Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz calling ICE officers “Gestapo” to others calling them “fascists” and “Nazis,” Democratic leaders have been ignoring objections that they are fueling the violent and criminal responses. It did not matter. It was viewed as good politics.<br>While Newsom and figures like Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) have called these “peaceful” protests, rocks, and Molotov cocktails have been thrown at police as vehicles were torched. Police had to use tear gas, “flash bang” grenades, and rubber bullets to quell these “peaceful” protesters.<br>There appears little interest in deescalation on either side. For the Trump Administration, images of rioters riding in celebration around burning cars with Mexican flags are only likely to reinforce the support of the majority of Americans for the enforcement of immigration laws.<br>For Democrats, they have gone “all in” on opposing ICE and these enforcement operations despite support from roughly 30 percent of the public.<br>Some democrats are now playing directly to the mob. A Los Angeles City Council member, Eunisses Hernandez, reportedly urged anti-law enforcement protesters to “escalate” their tactics against ICE officers:  “They know how quickly we mobilize, that’s why they’re changing tactics. Because community defense works and our resistance has slowed them down before… and if they’re escalating their tactics then so are we. When they show up, we gotta show up even stronger.” [Nếu phát biểu này của Hernandez được trình bày trước tòa như chứng cớ xúi giục bạo động!...] <br>So, L.A. officials are maintaining the sanctuary status of the city, barring the cooperation of local police, and calling on citizens to escalate their resistance after a weekend of violent attacks. Others have posted the locations of ICE facilities to allow better tracking of operations while cities like Glendale are closing facilities.<br>In Washington, Jeffries has pledged to unmask the identities of individual ICE officers who have been covering their faces to protect themselves and their families from growing threats.<br>While Democrats have not succeeded in making a convincing political case for opposing immigration enforcement, they may be making a stronger case for federal deployment in increasingly hostile blue cities.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R18" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">19</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/9/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MÂU THUẪN TRUMP-MUSK TỪ MỘT GIÁC ĐỘ KHÁC<br>Bỉnh bút Gerard Baker có mục quan điểm Free Expression trên tờ WSJ.

Photo: roberto schmidt/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images<br>The alliance between Donald Trump and Elon Musk was always likely to be about as durable as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the 1939 deal Nazi Germany struck with the Soviet Union days before invading Poland. I won’t extend the analogy too far for obvious reasons of taste, except to say that deals rarely last when they are made for short-term advantage between two parties with outsize ambitions but divergent characters.<br>The more important question is: Does this split signal something fundamentally awry in the MAGA coalition? What does the quick disillusionment of the Republican Party’s most prominent convert mean for the president and the party’s wider fortunes?<br>On the face of it, not much. For one thing, the rupture seems mainly personal. In some respects the MAGA movement is a personality cult. Mr. Musk wasn’t that personality. The Tesla and SpaceX boss is a brilliant but mercurial man whose pathologies can lead him to dark places, as we have learned more since the breakup. Even in this White House, it seems, some decorums can’t be breached.<br>But Mr. Musk’s rising animus seems also to have been based on a belated realization that the returns from his alliance were heavily asymmetric. As an example of Mr. Trump’s facility for one-sided deal making, it can hardly be bettered. What Mr. Musk gave - in campaign money, in good publicity for the Department of Government Efficiency’s assault on wasteful spending, in lost value for Tesla, and in his own diminished personal wealth and reputation - wasn’t close to matched by whatever he was supposed to be getting in return. At least the Soviets got a chunk of Poland and the Baltic states before Barbarossa ended the relationship. [Ác liệt!]<br>But there’s more to the break than the inevitable parting of two powerful and incompatible egos. For all his idiosyncrasies, Mr. Musk represented a certain class of business leaders who, to varying levels of enthusiasm, embraced Mr. Trump and his unorthodox style. They had grown alarmed by the left’s suffocating control of the nation’s institutions and were eager for the more economically orthodox parts of the Trump agenda. Many surprised themselves with how enthusiastically they voted last year, believing he would deliver mainly more of the good stuff from the first term. They hoped he would foster growth and economic opportunity, reverse the Biden administration’s regulatory fetishism, and end woke extremism.<br>They are only half happy with the outcome. On deregulation, tax-cutting and the cultural counterrevolution, Mr. Trump hasn’t disappointed. But growing numbers of business leaders I speak with (quietly) express dismay about the misbegotten tariff and trade policies, the lack of interest in fiscal prudence, and the willful alienation of allies and partners around the world (the last a problem to which Mr. Musk contributed).<br>The Musk divorce is symbolic of the tension at the heart of the new Republican coalition. Mr. Trump’s working- and middle-class multiethnic alliance is driving the highly successful cultural counterrevolution on the border, race, sex and national security. But those same voters are none too keen on Mr. Musk’s free-market approach to trade, migration, taxes and spending.<br>This tension isn’t new. It’s been a core feature of Republican politics for decades. It probably will remain mostly suppressed as long as Mr. Trump is boss, because of the sheer force of his personality and the willingness of his less enthusiastic supporters to submit. But we can expect these fractures to widen in the coming years as the battle for the future of the party begins in earnest.<br>The other significance of the Musk break is that it represents a slight loosening of the climate of coercive authoritarianism Mr. Trump has fostered. As business leaders have watched his treatment of law firms and media companies and others he deems hostile, most have been reluctant to walk into that propeller with public criticism. They will be watching carefully to see whether Mr. Musk faces retribution. But the spectacle of America’s richest man and most creative entrepreneur brazenly denouncing the president can’t help but change the climate.<br>There have been signs in recent weeks that other parts of civil society are rising to challenge the Trump supremacy: senators criticizing his fiscal approach and pressing to support Ukraine; the administration’s bowing to court rulings on deportation.<br>When he acquired and transformed Twitter, Mr. Musk described himself as a “free speech absolutist.” He hasn’t always behaved like one in the past year. But his dramatic break with the White House is a useful reminder that for all the concerns Mr. Trump understandably arouses about the health of our democracy, a pluralistic, diverse republic doesn’t disappear that easily.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R19" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">20</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/9/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">‘LỖI TẠI TRUMP…’ NÊN CHÚNG TÔI MỚI ĐI HAI CHÂN!<br>Sau bài viết trên The Spectator về việc con ranh Greta Thunberg được Chính quyền Israel đón tiếp lịch sự khi nó đòi vượt Địa Trung Hải để cứu dân Palestine, chúng ta lại bật cười nữa nhờ phân tách của giáo sư Jonathan Turley về chuyện Mỹ. <br>Bao năm qua, các đại học hay bộ máy công quyền để bọn cực tả lũng đoạn và trở thành trung tâm kỳ thị Do Thái, ngợi ca khủng bố, dưới ánh sáng của chủ trương DEI, là phát huy tính đa diện, công bằng và hội nhập (diversity, equity and inclusion).

The TDI defense is allowing executives and administrators to do what they lacked the courage to do for years.<br>Here is the column:<br>“Trump Made Me Do It.”<br>Across the country, this is a virtual mantra being mouthed everywhere from businesses to higher education. Corporations are eliminating woke programs. Why? Trump did it. Universities are eliminating DEI offices and cracking down on campus extremism. Trump did it. Democratic politicians are abandoning far-left policies. Trump did it.<br>For those who lack both courage or conviction, the claim of coercion is often the next best thing. The “TDI defense” is born.<br>Of course, they did not invent Trump, but they needed him. For years, schools like Harvard and Columbia ignored warnings about the rising antisemitism on campuses. They refused to punish students engaged in criminal conduct, including occupying and trashing buildings. These administrators did not want to risk being tagged by the far-left mob for taking meaningful action.<br>Then the election occurred, and suddenly they were able to blame Trump for doing what they should have been doing all along.<br>Administrators are now cracking down on extreme elements on campuses.<br>At the same time, hundreds of schools are closing DEI offices around the country. Again, most are not challenging the Trump administration’s orders on DEI or seeking to adopt more limited responses. They are all in with the move, while professing that they have little choice.<br>In other words, schools are increasingly turning to TDI to end DEI.<br>The legal landscape has changed with an administration committed to opposing many DEI programs as discriminatory and unlawful. However, it is the speed and general lack of resistance that is so notable. In most cases, the Trump administration did not have to ask twice. Trump seemed to “have them at hello,” as if they were longing for a reason to reverse these trends.<br>Many will continue to fight this fight surreptitiously. For example, shortly before the Trump election, the University of North Carolina System Board of Governors voted to ban DEI and focus on “institutional neutrality.” Yet, even Administrators emboldened by the TDI defense are finding resistance in their ranks. For exsmple, UNC Asheville Dean of Students Megan Pugh was caught on videotape, saying that eliminating these offices means nothing: “I mean we probably still do anyway… but you gotta keep it quiet.”  She added, “I love breaking rules.”<br>The Board, perhaps not feeling the same thrill, reportedly responded by firing her.<br>The same pattern is playing out in businesses. Over the last few weeks, companies ranging from Amazon to IBM have removed references to DEI programs or policies. Bank of America explained, “We evaluate and adjust our programs in light of new laws, court decisions, and, more recently, executive orders from the new administration.”<br>Once established, these DEI offices tended to expand as an irresistible force within their institutions and companies. Full-time diversity experts demanded additional hirings and policies on hiring, promotion, and public campaigns. Since these experts were tasked with finding areas for “reform,” their proposals were treated as extensions of that mandate. To oppose the reforms was to oppose the cause.<br>While some executives and administrators supported such efforts, others simply lacked the courage to oppose them. No one wanted to be accused of being opposed to “equity” or being racist, sexist, or homophobic. The results were continually expanding programs impacting every level of businesses and institutions.<br>Then Trump showed up. Suddenly, these executives and administrators had an excuse to reverse this trend. They could also rely on court decisions that have undermined long-standing claims of advocates that favoring certain groups at the expense of others was entirely lawful.<br>This week, the Supreme Court added to these cases with its unanimous ruling in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, to remove impediments to lawsuits by members of majority groups who are discriminated against.<br>For many years, lower courts have required members of majority groups (white, male, or heterosexual) to shoulder an added burden before they could establish claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In a decision written by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court rejected that additional burden and ordered that everyone must be treated similarly under the law.<br>Many commentators noted that the ruling further undermined the rationales for disparate treatment based on race or other criteria within DEI.<br>In other words, more of these programs are likely to be the subject of federal investigations and lawsuits. Of course, if these executives and administrators were truly committed to the programs in principle, they could resolve to fight in the courts. The alternative is just to blame Trump and restore prior policies that enforce federal standards against all discriminatory or preferred treatment given to employees based on race, sex, religion, or other classifications.<br>Former Vice President Hubert Humphrey once observed that “to err is human. To blame someone else is politics.” That is evident among politicians. For years, many moderate Democrats voted to support far-left agendas during the Biden administration, lacking the courage or principles to oppose the radical wing of the Democratic Party. Now, some are coming forward to say that the party has “lost touch with voters.”<br>Rather than admit that their years of supporting these policies were wrong, they blame Trump and argue that the party must move toward the center to survive.<br>The calculus is simple: You never act on principle when you can blame a villain instead. It is not a profile of courage but one of simple convenience. No need for admissions or responsibility — just TDI and done.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R20" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">21</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/9/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TỪ NƯỚC MỸ NỔI ĐIÊN ĐẾN CON RANH HÓA DẠI<br>Sinh tại Thụy Điển năm 2003, mới 15 tuổi con ranh Greta Thunberg đã được đám lưu manh quốc tế thổi lên thành chuyên gia chống nạn nhiệt hóa địa cầu để cứu nhân loại.

This time, however, the curtain has come down swiftly. The latest vessel to set sail in defiance of Israel’s naval blockade of Gaza – the Madleen, a boat bloated with virtue signaling and the vanity of performative compassion – has been intercepted by the Israeli Navy.<br>The operation was executed peacefully and without casualties by fighters from Fleet 13, Israel’s naval commando forces. The ship is now making its way safely to the port of Ashdod, its dozen passengers – including Greta Thunberg, the climate whiner turned omni-cause moral voice – healthy, unharmed and provided with sandwiches (individually wrapped in plastic, sorry Greta) and water.<br>The Israeli Foreign Ministry left no doubt about the farcical nature of this voyage: “There are ways to provide aid to the Gaza Strip – they don’t involve Instagram selfies.”<br>The Madleen’s cargo, amounting to less than one aid truck, will be transferred to Gaza through genuine humanitarian channels. Meanwhile, more than 1,200 aid trucks have entered Gaza from Israel in the past two weeks alone, and nearly 11 million meals have been distributed directly to civilians through the Gaza Humanitarian Fund.<br>During their virtue-signaling sailing jolly, one can only hope that Greta and her companions brought something worthwhile to read. They might reflect on the cautionary tale of Vittorio Arrigoni – a story that should linger as a somber whisper against hubris. In August 2008, Arrigoni arrived in Gaza by boat with the Free Gaza Movement flotilla. During Operation Cast Lead, he became one of the best-known Western voices in Gaza, writing prolifically and immersing himself in the territory’s brutal complexities.<br>Yet in his zeal to “stay human,” Arrigoni drifted dangerously close to factions linked to Hamas and other Islamist groups – remaining ideologically blind to the jihadist forces brewing in parallel. His was a worldview intoxicated by its own moral purity, one that refused to see the brutal realities of the actors around him. The consequences were fatal. In April 2011, Arrigoni was abducted by the Salafist group Tawhid wal-Jihad, and hanged by those he thought he understood.<br>Yet even in the aftermath, some refused to confront the truth. His family’s decision to repatriate his body via Egypt – avoiding any cooperation with Israel – betrayed a continued ideological obstinacy. Critics such as Fiamma Nirenstein denounced him as “a fan of political Islamism” and “an enemy of the Jews.” Others labelled him a “terror tourist” and an “ideological tourist” who failed to grasp the lethal indoctrination coursing through the territory he romanticized.<br>Arrigoni’s death became a grim parable of Western moralism divorced from realism. Thunberg’s voyage risked repeating this same grievous error – albeit on a larger stage. Now it has ended in anti-climax, its intended media provocation neutralized.<br>Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz rightly congratulated the IDF for its swift and safe action to uphold the naval blockade. He has ordered that the flotilla passengers be shown video evidence of the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7.<br>By attempting to breach the blockade, the Madleen’s activists sought not to relieve the suffering of Gazans, but to stage a photogenic tableau for Western media. A few boxes of rice, tampons and crutches would not change conditions in Gaza. The flotilla’s purpose was theatrical – and dangerous theatre at that.<br>Israel’s right to enforce its naval blockade, as upheld in the 2011 Palmer Report, remains firmly grounded in international law. Humanitarian aid does and must continue to flow through controlled channels. What the Madleen attempted was not responsible aid, but irresponsible grandstanding.<br>The vanity of it all is appalling. It makes a mockery both of Israel’s legitimate security concerns and of the Palestinians themselves, whose plight cannot be alleviated by the conspicuous virtue of foreign celebrities. The Palestinians become a passive backdrop, their suffering instrumentalized for a Western morality play, starring the world’s most famous contemporary white savior.<br>Had the Madleen succeeded in docking, the activists would have faced a chaotic and volatile landscape in which not all factions share their idealism – nor even basic tolerance for foreign interference. They would have been in everybody’s way, but in nobody’s service.<br>Arrigoni sailed under the banner of Restiamo umani – “Stay human” – and it remains a noble injunction.

Junk bond issuers are the corporate world’s version of “subprime” homebuyers. Trouble signs in this market could signal bigger problems elsewhere.<br>-Patrick Watson<br>[Nguyên bản của Mark Grant:]<br>The High Yield Bond Dilemma <br>Mark Grant | June 9, 2025 <br>The sales of high yield bonds are surging, and yields are rising, as trade negotiations approach their Presidential imposed deadline. <br>U.S. companies, with risky credit ratings, are rushing to sell junk bonds ahead of an expected resurgence of trade tensions in July that could depress demand for corporate debt. Companies with weaker credit ratings tapped the high-yield bond market for $32bn in May, the most since October, according to data from J.P. Morgan. Junk bond sales in the first week of June already surpassed April’s $8.6bn total. <br>Bankers and investors say they expect a steady flow of new debt <br>sales during the rest of the month, and into July, while demand <br>remains high and market uncertainty stays relatively low. However, the expiration of the 90-day pause on Donald Trump’s so-called “liberation day” tariffs early next month could set up another surge in uncertainty, echoing the early April auctions that ground the market for new levered debt deals to a halt. In my opinion, we will see yields rising even further in the months ahead.  <br>We are now at a point where we have the highest level for corporate borrowing costs since May 2023, as investors demanded <br>a higher premium for the added risk they saw following Trump’s <br>April 2 tariff announcement. As progress appeared to be made in <br>trade negotiations between the US and China, spreads retreated. <br>Still, they have not come back to the historically low marks <br>seen in late 2024 and early 2025, when junk bond spreads fell <br>below 3 percentage points. <br>I don’t think we’re going to go back to April where the market is grinding to a halt, but it’s certainly going to cause spreads to be wider, in my view. There is also strong demand for highly rated corporate credit. Bank of America strategists say they expect investment-grade bond sales to be between $110bn and $120bn in June, which would be the most for the calendar month since 2021. <br>My advice here is for fixed-income buyers to be cautious and wait. Between the widening in spreads and the additional issuance, it is quite likely, in my opinion, that higher yields are in front of us and any buying, at this point, may be a mistake. <br>          “Bond yields - the returns investors receive on bonds - are moving targets. They go up when bond prices go down and vice versa. Likewise, bond spreads get wider or tighter depending on several factors, including supply and demand, credit risk and the overall state of the economy. Because a credit spread represents the relationship between a bond and a comparable Treasury bond, a spread may change because of factors affecting the bond itself, the Treasury bond against which it’s measured, or both.” -FINRA </td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R23" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">24</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/9/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">CẬP NHẬT ĐÊM NAY CỦA WSJ:<br>[Bao xe hơi không chủ đã tự đốt cháy một cách ôn hòa trong bóng đêm Los Angeles để chào mừng tình hữu nghị với Mexico!...]<br>https://www.wsj.com/.../national-guard-la-ice-protests...<br>L.A.

On Sunday afternoon, Newsom said he had formally requested the White House to rescind the “unlawful” deployment and return the troops to his command, warning it would only ramp up tensions.<br>Newsom urged people in the streets to stay peaceful, an admonition some demonstrators ignored as crowds blocked a major roadway through downtown and people set fire to several self-driving ride-hailing vehicles nearby. Newsom met Sunday evening with law enforcement leaders in Los Angeles, he posted on X. “We’re here to keep the peace - not play into Trump’s political games,” he wrote.<br>In a Truth Social post late Sunday, Trump described the unrest as an attack on immigration enforcement efforts. “A once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by illegal aliens and criminals,” he wrote.<br>Trump called the demonstrations “migrant riots” and said federal agencies were directed to take “all such action necessary” to restore order and continue deportation operations.<br>Federal law enforcement officials clashed briefly with a smaller group of demonstrators earlier on Sunday when a crowd gathered outside a federal building in downtown LA.<br>The Los Angeles Police Department declared an unlawful assembly in the area surrounding the federal facility, using less than lethal munitions, like tear gas and batons to chase the crowd back. The LAPD said some people in the crowd threw bottles, chunks of concrete and other objects, and that arrests have been made.<br>The ICE raids are sending a sense of fear and chaos into the city, LA Mayor Karen Bass said during a press conference late Sunday afternoon, adding that people who want to protest should do so peacefully. The First Amendment grants a right to peaceful protest “but it does not give you the right to be violent to create chaos, or to vandalize property, and that will not be tolerated,” she said.<br>The tense demonstration follows two days of protests sparked by sweeping US immigration raids across the region. Trump directed US Northern Command to assume control of the National Guard and dispatch 2,000 soldiers to the area “for 60 days or at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense,” the White House said in a statement<br>About 300 soldiers from the California National Guard’s 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team have been deployed to three locations in greater LA, according to US Northern Command. The Guard is focused on “safety and protection of federal property and personnel,” the command said in a post on X.<br>The 79th IBCT is primarily a combat unit, though it has previously been called up to support civilian authorities, and a unit most recently responded to the LA-area wildfires earlier this year.<br>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that Marines could be sent next if protests intensify. Newsom called Hegseth’s suggestion of deploying the Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton “deranged.”<br>Hegseth on Sunday countered that Newsom had allowed violence to get out of hand.<br>“Deranged = allowing your city to burn &amp; law enforcement to be attacked,” Hegseth said in a post on X. “There is plenty of room for peaceful protest, but ZERO tolerance for attacking federal agents who are doing their job. The National Guard, and Marines if need be, stand with ICE.”<br>Facing mounting pressure from the White House, ICE has ramped up arrests in recent weeks, averaging about 2,000 detentions per day nationwide - still falling short of the administration’s goal of at least 3,000 daily arrests. The stepped-up enforcement is part of Trump’s vow to carry out the largest deportation campaign in US history. In the LA area, ICE reported 118 arrests this week, though the agency has not released updated figures as of Sunday morning.<br>Los Angeles police said on Sunday that officers were actively monitoring protests and guarding civic buildings alongside the Guard. LAPD Police Chief Jim McDonnell has stressed they’re not working with federal agents on civil immigration enforcement, and said the department follows a long-standing policy that bars officers from stopping people for the sole purpose of determining their immigration status.<br>“Everyone has the right to peacefully assemble and voice their opinions,” the department said in a statement on X. “However, vandalizing property and attempting to seriously injure officers, whether Federal or LAPD, is not peaceful.”<br>A demonstrator on a burned out car during protests in Paramount, California.Photographer: Jon Putman/Anadolu/Getty Images<br>The protests were triggered in part by federal immigration raids that swept through the city from late Friday. Demonstrators gathered outside the federal building downtown, including outside a detention center. Other protests broke out in Compton and in Paramount, south of the city, where a crowd formed near a Home Depot as raids were reportedly underway.<br>Tensions escalated when some protesters threw objects at officers, prompting the LAPD to declare an unlawful assembly and order the crowd to disperse, according to local media reports. Riot police used tear gas and flash-bang grenades.<br>US Representative Nanette Barragan, a Democrat whose district includes Paramount and other parts of Los Angeles County, accused the Trump administration of using federal troops to suppress dissent. By the time the more violent skirmishes broke out Saturday night, the original protesters had already cleared out and the “unruly folks” had arrived, she said.<br>“It’s going to escalate the situation,” she said Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union. “People are going to protest because they’re angry about the situation. And we have to just reiterate the people to do it peacefully.”<br>Barragan described ICE agents stopping “anybody at a bus stop that’s going to shop” and said she was warned to expect 30 days of stepped-up enforcement.<br>‘Form of Rebellion’<br>Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut off federal funding to cities and states that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities - so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions - including LA. California law bars local law enforcement from using resources to assist in most federal immigration actions.<br>In response to past federal crackdowns, California Attorney General Rob Bonta has defended the state’s sanctuary policies and sued the Trump administration over attempts to force local compliance, arguing that California has the right to set its own public safety priorities.<br>In an interview with NBC News, Trump border czar Tom Homan said Newsom and Bass should be thanking the president for helping to restore order. Homan warned the leaders could face arrest if they obstruct immigration enforcement efforts.<br>The White House said the National Guard was being deployed to protect federal personnel and property, including immigration detention centers, citing what Trump described as credible threats of violence that could obstruct enforcement efforts and “constitute a form of rebellion” against the US government.<br>But the legal basis for the decision could face challenges. Federal law strictly limits the deployment of federal troops within US borders.<br>The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, along with amendments and supporting regulations, generally bars the use of the active-duty U.S. military - the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines - from carrying out domestic law enforcement.

There, Rodriguez rubbed shoulders with &quot;comrades&quot; from pro-Hamas groups and other radical organizations, coming away impressed with their &quot;commitment to actually getting things done,&quot; according to a video and an online fundraiser unearthed by the Washington Free Beacon.<br>    Rodriguez’s attendance at the People’s Congress of Resistance provides insight into his early path towards radicalism, which culminated Wednesday night when Rodriguez allegedly assassinated Israeli diplomats Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim as they left an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.<br>    Witnesses said Rodriguez, 30, shouted &quot;Free Palestine&quot; after the shooting and waved a keffiyeh. Rodriguez reportedly admitted to the killings and has been charged with first-degree murder.<br>    ANSWER Chicago, a subsidiary of the left-wing ANSWER Coalition, raised money to send Rodriguez to the People’s Congress of Resistance, a two-day conference at Howard University held to &quot;chart a path of nationwide grassroots resistance and mobilization to defeat Trump&#39;s reactionary program of unrestrained capitalism.&quot; ANSWER Coalition, the anti-war group CODEPINK, and Samidoun, a pro-Hamas organization designated last year as a terrorist group, organized the resistance conference.<br>    &quot;Help us send Elias Rodriguez, a young resister and son of an Iraq war veteran, to the People&#39;s Congress of Resistance,&quot; ANSWER Chicago wrote in a social media post soliciting donations for Rodriguez.<br>    ...<br>    &quot;I’m attending the People’s Congress of Resistance for many reasons, but a personal one for me is to put a final end to imperialist war, which the U.S. Congress of billionaires has a vested interest in expanding indefinitely,&quot; said Rodriguez.<br>    Rodriguez was impressed with what he saw at the conference.<br>    After returning to Chicago, Rodriguez provided a summary of his trip during a meeting for the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a radical group that works closely with ANSWER Chicago.<br>    &quot;The People’s Congress was all about organizing the most oppressed to win real victories. I’ve never in my life been around so many people who share the same determinism [sic] to go beyond activism for the sake of activism,&quot; Rodriguez said in a video reviewed by the Free Beacon.<br>Once is happenstance. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is enemy action. Obviously, something is going on here with this group and this billionaire, what with the Columbia violence, the killings in Washington, and now the destructive riots in Los Angeles, which is also home to many bad antisemitic attacks. I don&#39;t have any information about this group being involved in the recent flamethrower attack on elderly Jews in Colorado, but we already have the destructive pattern with the other activity.<br>That&#39;s too many times for a group like this to be getting its name in the news and one can only hope that the FBI and other lawmen are investigating this string of acts and connections to the fullest exent allowable by law.

Luo said he fled China after exposing falsified animal farming data used to meet GDP targets, as well as the regime’s mistreatment of farmers. The Epoch Times<br>(By Lily Zhou - The Epoch Times - Updated: June 05, 2025)<br>When Luo Zhifei, a Chinese local government employee in rural Guangdong, produced a non-authorized report on bees in 2023, he never expected to get a visit from police, or be questioned about whether he had any foreign contacts, and threatened with being sent to a mental hospital.<br>Luo, who fled to the United States last year, recently told the Chinese edition of The Epoch Times how he was forced to make up animal farming statistics to match the communist regime’s GDP target. He also alleged that his superiors and colleagues fined farmers on bogus charges to fill local government coffers, and targeted him for speaking out against such practices.<br>Luo, 40, was born in a rural area in Jiangxi, a southeastern province near Guangdong. Between July 2020 and summer 2024, the veterinary medicine postgraduate worked in Zengcheng District in Guangzhou for the district Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (BARA), first as an administrator in the agricultural law enforcement section, then as an animal farming statistician in the town of Paitan.<br>For those born to a common rural family, a job in China’s public institutions, commonly described as an “iron rice bowl,” isn’t easy to get. Applicants are required to take an exam and an interview, and they are vetted to make sure they fit a range of criteria; aside from not having a criminal record they mustn’t show signs of opposition to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or socialist ideology.<br>“To me, working for the government meant job security,” Luo said. “I heard that … the government in Guangdong was relatively transparent, and did more to serve the people. That’s what I thought before I started the job.”<br>Law Enforcement Abuse<br>When Luo worked in the agricultural law enforcement section of BARA in Zengcheng District, it was part of his job to produce paperwork for law enforcement cases, and he often received photo evidence from colleagues in the field.<br>Many of the photos “basically showed how they bullied the farmers,” he said. “When I saw the helplessness and anger in the farmers’ eyes, I couldn’t bear it.”<br>According to Luo, in many cases, officers did not have enough evidence to justify a penalty, but they nevertheless issued burdensome fines and often forced farmers to pay by threatening them.<br>Zengcheng District is known for the production of lychee, a tropical fruit commonly found in southern China and Southeast Asia.<br>According to Luo, local lychee farmers are required to only use pesticides that specify they can be used on lychee trees.<br>“As soon as officers found a [non-compliant] empty pesticide bottle near lychees, they would open a case regardless of whether there were other crops around. That evidence is far from sufficient because we couldn’t have known whether the pesticide was used on lychees or other crops,” he said.<br>“Many farmers said they hadn’t used the pesticides on lychees, and the officers threatened them.”<br>According to Luo, in 2021, a farmer accused of such misuse of pesticides would be fined 8,000 yuan ($1,110) if he was registered as a sole trader. For those registered as co-ops, they were fined 10 times the amount, or 80,000 yuan. If the farmers contested the fines, the officers threatened to report them to the police, and told the farmers that the record would affect their children’s education and job opportunities, Luo said.<br>image-5867259<br>A farmer walks through her fields on Shazai Island near Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, on June 22, 2016. In Zengcheng District, which includes the island, farmers must use only approved pesticides for lychee farming or face fines. Luo Zhifei said Zengcheng recorded the most agricultural enforcement cases in Guangdong in 2020, totaling 2.6 million yuan (about $361,000) in fines and seized assets. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images<br>In March 2022, Luo voiced his objection in a meeting during which officers were encouraged to hand out more financial penalties in attempts to increase revenue.<br>“The section chief said that the Zengcheng government was struggling financially, and he encouraged us to increase the number of enforcement cases and the amount of fines,” he said.<br>“In 2020, Zengcheng had the biggest number of agricultural law enforcement cases among all districts in Guangdong province, he said we should aim for number one again in 2022.”<br>image-5867917<br>According to Luo, in 2021, the district bureau raised 2.6 million yuan (around $361,000) in fines and property confiscations, and the section chief set up an annual target of 4 million yuan (around $555,200) for 2022.<br>During the meeting, Luo said penalties needed to be backed up by evidence.<br>“We can’t fine farmers just for the income because of the pandemic, or because the district government can not raise money by selling land,” he recalled telling his colleagues.<br>Under Chinese law, the state owns all land in urban areas, while rural land is partly owned by the state and partly under local collective ownership. Local governments rely heavily upon income generated from selling the right to use land and on other property-related taxes.<br>According to a 2023 report published by the independent think tank Macro Research (Beijing) Institute of Information Technology, between 2015 and 2021, the proportion of land- and property-related income grew from 26 percent to 36.7 percent of all local government revenue.<br>Since 2022, total local government income from selling the right to use land has been in decline for three consecutive years. According to figures published by the Ministry of Finance, in 2022, the figure was 6.7 trillion yuan (around $930 billion), a 23.3 percent drop from 2021. It dropped further by 13.2 percent in 2023 and 16 percent in 2024.<br>After Luo’s remarks in March 2022, the section chief and a deputy head of Zengcheng District, both of whom were present at the meeting, rejected Luo’s allegation that the fines were unjustified, Luo said.<br>According to Luo, when he began working for BARA, his superiors demonstrably appreciated the quality of his work, but since the meeting, he felt ostracized by colleagues, and the district head nitpicked his work.<br>Besides ostracism, “my world view also started to collapse,” he said. “I began suffering from insomnia and depression. I’ve been seeing the doctor since May 2022.”<br>image-5867257<br>A farmer waters a garden in Zengcheng, Guangzhou Province, China, on Dec. 16, 2004. China Photos/Getty Images<br>Fake Numbers<br>A year later, Luo was reassigned to work for the animal health supervision unit in Paitan, a town in Zengcheng District, to collect and report statistics on animal farming production.<br>“As soon as I was reassigned, I knew it was a bad job,” he said. “Because I was responsible for reporting the data. If there was anything wrong with the data, I was the one liable. … However, we were not given any time to collect the data.”<br>Luo said his boss instructed him and his colleagues to make up statistics.<br>“He said: ‘We’ve always gone with the national GDP targets.&#39; You know, we have a national target for annual GDP at the beginning of the year. For instance, the target was around 5 percent in 2023, we would increase all the figures from the previous year by 5.5 percent and fill those numbers in the report.”<br>Luo said that method was used to produce most, if not all, of the reports.<br>In 2023, the Chinese regime reported a 5.2 percent annual increase in GDP.<br>Despite the some 5 percent increases on the books, in reality, most of the farmers in Paitan - including poultry, cattle, and goat farmers - were losing money during and after the pandemic, Luo said.<br>“Judging by the conversation I had with them, I believe around 70 or 80 percent of the farmers were losing money; only 20 to 30 percent made a profit,” he said.<br>In December 2023, Luo openly questioned the price of honey in local statistics.<br>Luo’s unit reported that the price of honey was 50 yuan (around $7) per kilogram, while the price was only around 26 yuan. Luo said he knew the real price because he had conducted an unauthorized survey of beekeepers on his own time and produced a report.<br>“I knew there was an annual meeting on statistics in December 2023, so I printed my report on bees and the prices of honey, distributed a copy of the report to each attendee, and told them my opinion.”<br>Luo told his colleagues that if all towns in China used the same data reporting procedure, Beijing would make serious policy errors, and that farmers were not able to get the support they needed because they appeared to be making a profit on the books.<br>“I wasn’t allowed to finish my speech,” he said.<br>image-5867260<br>Chinese armed police stand guard inside the Great Hall of the People before the opening session of the National People&#39;s Congress in Beijing on March 5, 2017.

The district-level CCP Commission for Discipline Inspection questioned me on my thoughts and warned me not to leak any confidential information.<br>“What I never expected was that a policeman suddenly visited me some 10 days later. He asked me about my views on the government and whether I knew any foreigners. I was bewildered.”<br>Luo said the policeman also warned him against breaking the National Security Law.<br>After the police visit, Luo tried to quit his job, citing depression and anxiety as the reason, but he said the district Human Resources and Social Security Bureau told him he couldn’t resign because he had been put on probation.<br>Going Public<br>After another visit from the Zengcheng District’s CCP Commission for Discipline Inspection and Human Resources and Social Security Bureau on May 20, 2024, he livestreamed on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, that evening, to air his grievances and spoke of his opposition to the district BARA’s abuses of statistics and agriculture law enforcement rules. Some two hours later, the livestream was cut off. Luo’s account was blocked, and he began to get more attention from the police.<br>“The local public security station summoned me the next day. Before mentioning my livestream, they asked me about the two meetings in March 2022 and December 2023, and asked if what I had said during the meetings was really my view.<br>“They then questioned the state of my mind … and asked whether I was in my right mind when I spoke those words.”<br>Luo said he eventually signed a document under pressure, admitting that he had not been in the right state of mind.<br>“They threatened me: ‘You are not in a good mental state. If you don’t sign this, if you don’t admit that the contents of the meetings were confidential, I can get a doctor now to establish your mental state. And if the doctor says you are mentally ill, we have the power and the responsibility to immediately send you to a mental hospital.&#39;”<br>image-5867258<br>Riot police patrol deserted streets after several days of rioting in Zengcheng, Guangdong Province, China, on June 15, 2011.

In the United States, … I barely feel the presence of the state.”<br>Luo said his former employer and the police continued to contact him after he left China, and attempted to persuade his mother to convince him to return to the country.<br>Zengcheng district BARA didn’t respond to The Epoch Times’ request for comment.<br>Chang Qing contributed to this report.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R31" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">32</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/8/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">KINH TẾ HỌC CHỦ QUAN CỦA F.D.

Most Westerners are familiar with the Tudors, Stuarts, and Windsors of England, or the Romanovs of Russia, but few are aware of the names of Chinese dynasties such as the Zhou, Han, or Ming, let alone the notable figures associated with them.<br>In this essay, I acquaint the reader with a man named Wang Anshi 王安石 [Vương An Thạch] He lived from 1021 to 1086 AD during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). He passed the highly competitive imperial exam that qualified him for the civil service, and began his career in local administration. After gaining a reputation as knowledgeable in what we now call economics, he was appointed chancellor (akin to prime minister) by Emperor Shenzong in 1070. Almost twelve centuries later, Wang Anshi’s fame rivals that of any of the 18 nondescript emperors of the Song Dynasty.<br>In less than seven years as chancellor, Wang so disrupted the status quo with his “reform” agenda that “turmoil” describes his tenure as much as anything. What kind of change agent was he? Historians sometimes call him “the Chinese New Dealer,” a description I consider apt.<br>When Franklin Roosevelt inaugurated his “New Deal” program in 1933, he fancied himself an original policy maker, bold enough to try things not previously undertaken. As it turns out, whether FDR ever knew it or not, his interventionist plans for the economy mirrored policies that had been attempted many times in many places.<br>The 1939 book from Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist H.J. Haskell, The New Deal in Old Rome, recounted stunning parallels between FDR’s tax, spend, centralize, and regulate policies and those of the ancient Romans 2,000 years ago. See Are We Rome? for more on that. And almost a millennium before FDR’s theme song, “Happy Days Are Here Again,” Wang Anshi gave it a go in China. Instances in which politicians meddle are, sadly, far more common than those rare occasions when they leave us alone. This fact recalls two of my favorite quotes about the past. One is from Mark Twain: “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” Konrad Adenauer authored the other: “History is the sum total of things that could have been avoided.”<br>The Song Dynasty governed China for a little over three centuries (960–1279), although northern invaders forced its territory and capital city to the south in 1127. In keeping with the “light touch” that Confucian ideals taught, the regime allowed considerable economic freedom, producing remarkable advances in the arts, sciences, and engineering. Inventions of the period include banknotes and paper money, gunpowder, and astronomical clocks. Rice production soared, and so did China’s population. The country began building a navy for the first time in its history.<br>One-family rule, however, carries with it the same dangers and temptations that accompany one-party rule. Over time, corruption and bureaucracy grow. Privileges extended to the politically well-connected perpetuate inequalities that foster resentment and restrict upward mobility. Calls for “reform” increase. This describes China in the late 11th century.<br>Emperor Shenzong appointed Wang Anshi chancellor in 1070 because he sensed changes were needed. Wang, widely regarded as a “reformer,” promised to shake things up. He raised the standards of civil service examinations to improve the quality of officialdom. He sacked or demoted state employees who were incompetent or dishonest. So far, so good. But a man whom historians regard as an early economist should have known better than to implement some rather dubious economic changes he dubbed “New Policies.”<br>FDR’s New Deal of the 1930s was not a carbon copy of Wang Anshi’s New Policies of the 1070s, of course, but they share an activist, centralizing tendency. Both men enjoyed experimenting with the economy. The description of Wang’s governing philosophy in historian Mary Nourse’s 1942 book, A Short History of the Chinese, fits that of FDR like a glove: “The state should take the entire management of commerce, industry, and agriculture into its own hands, with a view to succoring the working classes and preventing them from being ground into the dust by the rich.”<br>FDR’s Agriculture Secretary (and one-term Vice President) [Tên mán đột Henry Wallace này còn có tư tưởng cộng sản và theo “xã hội chủ nghĩa”!] once referred to Wang Anshi as “a Chinese New Dealer who lived 900 years ago” and said this: <br>    &quot;Under very great difficulties, he was faced… with problems which, allowing for the difference between historical periods, were almost identical with the problems met by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. The methods which he employed were strikingly similar.&quot;<br>Under Wang’s New Policies program, the state extended low-interest loans to farmers, despite farm indebtedness already being a significant issue in China. Taxes were raised to help fund large-scale public works programs such as irrigation canals and public granaries. “The system,” writes James A. Mitchell, “demanded a highly centralized bureaucracy capable of accurately assessing land, resolving disputes, and enforcing regulations across the vast empire - a task that proved exceedingly difficult in practice.”<br>No doubt Henry Wallace had this in mind when he claimed Wang’s policies were “strikingly similar” to his boss FDR’s. Under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, the Roosevelt administration paid farmers not to grow crops or raise livestock. Wallace himself, as Agriculture Secretary, once ordered the killing of six million healthy baby pigs to reduce supply and raise the price of pork. Wang would likely have applauded such bold policy initiatives.<br>FDR demagogued against monopolies, but his National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 was a brazen attempt to cartelize American enterprise. It imposed industry-wide price codes so that one business couldn’t undercut another with lower prices. Nine hundred years earlier, Wang “reformed” the Chinese economy in part by controlling the price, production, and distribution of salt, tea, iron and other commodities. It was, as noted by Mitchell, a “level of government intervention which frequently led to corruption and inefficiency within the state-run monopolies themselves.” Even critics in Wang’s day charged that “the emphasis on monopolies…stifled innovation and competition, harming overall economic growth in the long run.”<br>In a 2018 article in the Cambridge Journal of Economics, author Xuan Zhao argues that Wang’s fiscal policies bear strong resemblance to the Keynesian policies of the New Deal. Both were rooted in the dubious notion that “government should pro-actively spend to stimulate the economy.” He quotes Wang himself, who is recorded as having said that one of his aims was “to take from the rich to aid the poor.” Moreover, writes Zhao, by injecting government more than ever into matters of investment and consumption, “Wang Anshi forged or restored the Chinese state into a countervailing power to the private sector.”<br>Though FDR is still hailed in dwindling quarters as an economic savior, the record strongly suggests that his New Deal was a flop, riddled with counterproductive expense, debt, and corruption. It likely prolonged the Great Depression by at least seven years.<br>After seven years of Wang Anshi as chancellor of China, the Emperor had had enough. The Great Experimenter was dismissed, and spent his remaining days writing poetry. China scholar Wolfgang Drechsler notes that today in China, consensus regards Wang as a failure.<br>All of which reminds me of another quote, this one attributed to writer Wynne McLaughlin: “Maybe history wouldn’t have to repeat itself if we listened once in a while.”<br>Sources and Additional Resources:<br>- Wang Anshi: Transforming China Through Bold Reforms by James A.

(Cindy Schultz for The Free Press)<br>Eleven states have legalized assisted dying, but only New York would have no waiting period, which risks turning suicide into a medical treatment option.<br>(By Madeleine Kearns - The Free Press - 06.08.25 - U.S. Politics)<br>Listen to Article<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>“We did not want to linger if there was a terminal diagnosis and no quality of life.”<br>In Nancy Murphy’s family, she said, this was always understood.<br>So when her sister, Joan, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2015 at age 85, she knew exactly what she would do. Joan was living in Vermont, where the state has allowed terminally ill patients to end their lives with a lethal prescription since 2013.<br>“Gradually, the disease finally overtook her body,” Nancy, 86, said. “She was lying in the hospital bed in her living room. We had hospice care, and she was just weaker and weaker every day. Then one morning, she said to me: ‘Nancy, today’s the day.’ ”<br>Nancy called Joan’s children. The next day, her daughter went to fill the prescription for lethal medication, while her sons bought champagne. They took turns toasting her, telling her how much they loved her. “We held her hands and touched her body.” Joan thanked everyone, then swallowed the drugs.<br>“Within 20 minutes, she was in a coma, and within two hours she was gone,” Nancy told me over the phone, breaking into tears. “It was a blessing for her that she was able to do that, and it was a blessing for us, too, that she could have a peaceful death.”<br>Would Nancy do the same thing? “Of course,” she told me. But she is a resident of New York, where assisted dying is not yet legal. That’s why, for the past decade, Nancy has been part of a movement to change the law in her home state.<br>Now, they’re closer than they ever have been. In April, New York’s “Medical Aid in Dying Act” passed the state assembly by a vote of 81 to 67. It has until the end of the legislative session - June 12 - to face a vote in the Senate. On Thursday, June 5, Senate majority leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said she believed there were enough votes for the legislation to pass and “it is likely that it will come to the floor.” Perhaps as soon as Monday, June 9.<br>If the legislation passes, New York would join the 11 other states that have legalized assisted dying in various forms. (It is also legal in the District of Columbia.) For those who have seen difficult deaths or are daunted by the prospect, the kind of death Nancy describes - peaceful and pain-free - is what they are hoping the law will all but guarantee.<br>But those opposed to assisted suicide - their preferred term - warn that such laws endanger the vulnerable by reshaping social norms so that, for some, the right to die becomes a duty to die. Moreover, New York’s legislation, they argue, is on the “outer edge” of liberalization, eliminating safeguards that exist in other states where medical aid in dying (MAID) is legal.<br>I spoke to people on both sides to better understand their concerns. To both proponents and opponents, New York’s assisted suicide bill is not only a matter of individual rights. To put it bluntly, the people who would be eligible to end their lives are already capable of doing so without help from doctors or lawmakers. But this bill would signal medical and societal approval for that choice and, in doing so, have ethical implications that reach far beyond the patients it is designed for.<br>Dr. Jeremy Boal, 57, a geriatrician from New York who served as chief clinical officer of the Mount Sinai healthcare system between 2017 and 2023, spent the first 10 years of his career running a program for people who were housebound with late-stage diagnoses. “I had a lot of firsthand experience with patients and family members who were near the end of life,” he said. Last November, he received a devastating diagnosis of his own. He has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. People diagnosed with this progressive neurodegenerative disease have an average life expectancy of two to five years and face symptoms like paralysis, and difficulties speaking, swallowing, and breathing.<br>“Initially, I was in total shock, and I went into a very severe depression,” he told me. “Having cared for a lot of people with ALS in very late stages of their illness, I knew what was ahead for me.”<br>One thought comforted him: If the symptoms became too much to cope with, he could ask a fellow doctor to help end his life. Though he lives in New York, he knew that he had “the resources and the connections to relocate if I have to” - to a state where medical assistance in dying is legal.<br>“That grief and fear and dread really started to lift because I felt like I had agency,” he said.<br>Eleven states have legalized assisted dying, but only New York would have no waiting period, which risks turning suicide into a medical treatment option. Will New York Soon Make It Too Easy to Die? The Free Press.<br>Dr. Jeremy Boal, at home in Craryville, New York, on June 6, 2025. After being diagnosed with ALS, he began campaigning for New York’s Medical Aid in Dying bill. (Cindy Schultz for The Free Press)<br>But not everyone can afford to go out of state. That’s why Boal decided to use “the remaining time that I had” to campaign for a change in New York’s law on behalf of state residents with less money and resources.<br>“I felt like I owed it to my fellow New Yorkers to try to make this available to them as well, and not just sort of selfishly know that I had a way to access it if I needed it,” he said.<br>But are the less fortunate grateful for his intervention?<br>Far from offering “peace and comfort,” said Michelle Uzeta, interim executive director of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, legalizing assisted suicide will only endanger “vulnerable communities - poor, disabled, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+ folk” since these are the groups “most at risk of being denied or unable to access care, being steered toward death, and having their lives devalued.”<br>Still, Boal sees New York’s legislation as of a piece with other states’ MAID laws. “None of the laws have ever been expanded to include people who aren’t terminal or people who just have mental health issues,” he said. He is confident that “there won’t be any abuse.”<br>For its supporters, assisted dying means giving spiraling people a sense of safety as much as control. (As Nancy put it, “a prescription’s a whole lot nicer than a shotgun.”)<br>Darren Chervitz, 51, a husband and father of two from Riverdale, New York, was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer last July. Since then, he has undergone surgery and a trial at Manhattan’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center - and, so far, has been responsive to treatment. For now, Chervitz’s cancer appears to be in remission, though he is at significant risk of recurrence.<br>“The length of the suffering and the way it’s relentless and how it affects my loved ones over an extended period of time: These are all, I think, valid reasons why someone would say, you know, ‘I’ve had my time on this planet, and I’ve loved it, and I want to go out with some level of control,’ ” he said.<br>At first, Chervitz said he felt “a little sheepish” advocating on behalf of the terminally ill. “There are other people who have, in my opinion, incredibly more urgent, compelling stories.” Like Boal, he knew had the resources to go out of state for medical aid in dying if it came to it.<br>I asked Chervitz if he saw assisted dying as an insurance policy for his worst-case scenario: the cancer returning in terminal form.<br>“That sounds more selfish than I am,” he said. “This diagnosis, in all sorts of ways, has forced me to take a closer look at my life and try - whether it’s causes I believe in, or important people in my life - just imbue more meaning in my time.”<br>In other words, in campaigning for MAID, he hopes to find redemption in suffering.<br>In the last 10 years, the arguments for and against euthanasia have played out across much of the Western world. But not all the legislation is equally lethal. In Oregon and Washington, there are more safeguards and fewer deaths (as a percentage of the population) than in Canada and the Netherlands.<br>In the states where MAID is legal, a lethal prescription must be self-administered (as opposed to administered by a doctor). The states also have mandatory waiting periods - a fixed amount of time that a patient has after requesting MAID to change their mind.<br>Richard Doerflinger is a bioethicist in Washington State who has been tracking assisted suicide laws for nearly 40 years. In his estimation, the New York bill may be the worst law of its kind in the United States.<br>“There is no waiting period in the New York bill. That’s the first time I’ve seen this,” he said, noting that most states with MAID laws have a minimum waiting period. In Oregon, it is 15 days, though a 2023 law allows this to be waived when the patient is expected to die before the waiting period ends.<br>“In New York, any patient could decide “in a moment of despair at first getting his or her diagnosis, ‘Oh my God, I just want to die,’ and sign off, and that’s the end of the process,” Doerflinger said. The patient could request the prescription, have it approved, and be dead within 24 hours.<br>In Oregon and other states, doctors are responsible for recommending a mental health evaluation if they suspect the patient suffers from “a psychological condition or depression causing impaired judgment.” Meanwhile, New York would require doctors to assess the patient’s “decision making capacity” and ability to make an “informed decision,” and refer the patient for a mental health evaluation only if they suspect he or she lacks these due to a “psychiatric or psychological disorder.” Doerflinger interprets this to mean that, under New York’s bill, “the mental health evaluation is only ordered by the physician if it looks like the psychological condition interferes with the patient’s ability to make a decision or take in information at all.”<br>But even in states with more explicit guidelines for mental health evaluations, the safeguard is not infallible. For instance, in Oregon, a man with a long history of depression and suicide attempts was given a lethal prescription (which he did not take) after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. In Colorado, young women have been given lethal prescriptions as a treatment for anorexia.<br>Wherever assisted suicide is legal in the United States, it is only supposed to be available to people who have terminal illnesses. But how do you define terminal? The New York bill defines a terminal illness as an incurable condition that will “within reasonable medical judgment, produce death within six months.” However, the legislation does not specify whether that is with or without treatment.<br>“So many people living with chronic disease can become terminal if they stop their treatments. And that then expands eligibility pretty significantly,” said Lydia Dugdale, a physician and ethicist at Columbia University, citing diabetes and HIV as examples.<br>In Oregon, “qualifying illnesses” for assisted suicide are listed as including “anorexia, arthritis, blood disease, complications from a fall, hernia, kidney failure, medical care complications, musculoskeletal system disorders, sclerosis, and stenosis.” In Maine, high blood pressure also counts.<br>“Why does it matter if depressed people inadvertently get assisted suicide?” Dugdale asks. “Well, as a society, we have always said that we treat depression and we prevent depressed people from killing themselves.” Some people fear that legalizing MAID will create a world in which suicide is seen as a treatment option even if a disease could be effectively managed.<br>Arguably, this is happening already. Stephanie Packer, a mother of seven from California, was diagnosed in 2012 with scleroderma - a life-threatening autoimmune disease - and given three years to live. She said that when she asked her insurance company about coverage of the treatment recommended by her doctors, her request was denied. But when she asked if they would cover assisted suicide, they said they would for a co-payment of $1.20.<br>“I have been in and out of hospice for the past six years with predictions that I only had six months or less to live,” she testified in 2024 to the Maryland General Assembly, which is considering its own MAID bill. “Each time, I qualified for lethal drugs and lived in fear that with my next prognosis, treatment would be denied in favor of cheaper lethal drugs.”<br>It is stories like these that have prompted even progressive lawmakers to oppose New York’s bill.<br>In explaining her opposition to the New York bill, assembly member Michaelle Solages - a Democrat and chair of the black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic, and Asian legislative caucus - cited “poverty, discrimination, a lack of support” and ultimately “a system that is unequal.”<br>Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, another Democratic assembly member, added: “While I do support the freedom to choose and freedom to decide in the pursuit of happiness, my concern and opposition of this bill comes from the great risk of targeting vulnerable communities of color, given the historical health disparities that they continue to face.”<br>Another question is: How much life is really left? And how much of it is worth living? In 2014, New Yorker James Joseph (“JJ”) Hanson, 33, was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Multiple doctors told him had just four months to live. “I’m thankful I didn’t listen to those doctors,” JJ later said. “If I had those suicide pills in my dark moments, I might not be here today.”<br>Not only did JJ outlive his prognosis by more than three years - he died in 2017 - but during his treatment, his wife, Kris, conceived and gave birth to the couple’s second son, Lucas, the big brother to James. “That is the danger with assisted suicide,” Kris said in an anti-euthanasia video. “You’ll never know, if you make that choice: You might have lived like JJ - he had three and a half good years, so many beautiful moments we’ve shared as a family. James has gotten to know his daddy. We have Lucas. The joys we have been able to experience in these three and a half years are too many to count.”<br>The assumption is that if suffering is in your future, life is not worth living. But what if the prognosis turns out to be better than expected? And what if you can’t imagine how important that time and experience might be?<br>“What I’m increasingly realizing is that a lot of people are so wed to their right to choose and self-determination, that it almost becomes a little bit of a Darwinian self-fulfilling prophecy,” said Dugdale, the Columbia physician and ethicist. “Like, let’s just have the survival of the fittest, and if you can’t hang and you want to off yourself or get assisted suicide or do something else, that’s fine. I mean, personally, that’s not the kind of world I want to live in.”<br>Another danger of the New York law is that it would be uniquely free from oversight. In other states, the doctor prescribing MAID must file a report on each case to the state authorities. The New York law requires only that the attending physician record the details in the patient’s medical records. The law does say that a commissioner would review “a sample” of those records and produce an annual report to the legislature about compliance. But who decides which “sample” documents the commissioner reviews? Doerflinger argues that, since those records are not easily available - or even identifiable - to the state, it would have to be doctors administering MAID. How likely is a doctor who didn’t comply with the law to volunteer incriminating records? In Oregon and Washington, the pharmacist preparing the lethal prescription also has to file a report, which at least keeps doctors who fall behind in their reporting accountable. But the New York law has no similar requirement.<br>Since death certificates would not mention that the patient died by lethal overdose, there would be no way for these causes of death to be reviewed.<br>“The fact that the patient’s death certificate is going to report the underlying illness as the cause of death is not unique to New York, but what’s unique to New York is that there isn’t any other way to find out which patients underwent this process,” said Doerflinger, the bioethicist in Washington.<br>In other words, if there turned out to be improper uses of the New York law - or even coercion or abuse - there would be no way of detection.<br>The bill’s supporters remain confident in the New York law’s safeguards. “We’ve had 25 years of experience with medical aid in dying, so it’s not like it was invented yesterday, and in all those years, there’s no documented case of a person being pressured to use medication,” said Nancy. “There is no documented case of abuse.”<br>Eleven states have legalized assisted dying, but only New York would have no waiting period, which risks turning suicide into a medical treatment option. Will New York Soon Make It Too Easy to Die? The Free Press.<br>Members of Compassion and Choices stand outside of the Senate Chamber as they call on legislators to support the Medical Aid in Dying bill on Thursday, June 6, 2025, at the Capitol in Albany, New York. (Cindy Schultz for The Free Press)<br>But what constitutes being pressured? In Oregon, nearly half of people who chose assisted suicide give fear of being a burden as a reason. When I asked Nancy about this, she didn’t see it as a problem.<br>In fact, she thought assisted dying could be a patient’s “gift to their family and their loved ones so that their family can see them die peacefully,” which is how she saw her sister’s death. “It seems pretty rational to me,” she said.<br>But I think of my friend Dovie.<br>Dovie, 34, is a New Yorker with a recessive genetic neuromuscular condition called nemaline myopathy, for which he requires an electric wheelchair, a portable ventilator to breathe, and assistance with basic tasks. He has suffered countless health challenges over the years, including severe depression, and has suffered more profoundly than any person I know.<br>I never think about whether it is “rational” for Dovie to run life’s course. I think about his immeasurable worth: his loyalty, his awe-inspiring courage, his love for his friends and family. I think about his deep intellect and faith. More than anything, I think about Dovie’s gift for bringing out the best in others, simply by being himself and allowing them the honor of caring for him.<br>In September, Dovie nearly died from hypoxia after his ventilator hose disconnected. Maddeningly, the same preventable catastrophe happened again a few weeks ago, and Dovie has been in intensive care ever since, fighting for his life. Just days before he was hospitalized, he wrote an article for UnHerd opposing New York’s efforts to legalize MAID, which he argued “cheapens disabled lives.”<br>For those of us who are lucky, the transition from healthy, independent, and hopeful about the future to sick, dependent, and facing imminent death comes late in life - and as a shock to the system. But there are millions of Americans like Dovie who struggle for years in the gray zone, floating between those two categories and living with conditions that require high-quality care and the devoted service of others.<br>The assisted-suicide advocates I spoke with have many admirable qualities. Chief among them is their strong will and clear-mindedness. But they risk assuming that everyone facing a devastating diagnosis is of a similar disposition. What they might not appreciate is that in insisting on control at the end of life, they are chipping away at the agency of those who have so little to begin with and whose motivations may be compromised by depression, uncertainty, loneliness, ambivalence, grief, poverty, or despair.<br>We owe these New Yorkers more than we currently give. And much more than a cocktail of barbiturates.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R33" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">34</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/8/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">HOA KỲ TUỘT VÀO CON DỐC HÈN MỌN CỦA ÂU CHÂU!<br>Bài phân tách hôm nay của giáo sư Jonathan Turley cho thấy bệnh hèn nhát vốn hay lây! <br>Chỉ vì Hoa Kỳ lại áp dụng chế độ kiểm duyệt từng thấy tại Liên Âu, cho nên trò gian của Liên Âu đang được phổ biến và ca tụng!<br>Xong rồi thì tan rất nhanh trong chợ bách hóa… <br>Có khác gì khi miền Nam lại bị ép buộc năm xưa và thời nay, đức Giáo hoàng Leo cũng thành bậc con chúa mà đi làm Thợ Vẽ hay Thợ Hàn như tranh vẽ của đấng Giáng Sinh năm xưa.<br>https://jonathanturley.org/.../ha-ha-thump-hawaii.../...<br>HA.,HA., Thump: Hawaii Sued by the Babylon Bee and Other Groups Over Speech Crimes<br>(Jonathan Turley - Constitutional Law, Free Speech - June 8, 2025) <br>We have previously discussed laws that seek to criminalize “materially deceptive” political content worldwide, including memes and parodies. A civil law was blocked in California, where satirists and comedians opposed a Democratic law barring parodies and other expressions considered misleading. Now, legislators in Hawaii are trying again with a new law (S 2687) that criminalizes “recklessly” distributing “materially deceptive media.” It is clearly unconstitutional and is only the latest such effort to chip away at free speech protections in the United States.<br>Gov. Josh Green (who is up for re-election) signed S2687 into law in July 2024. It prohibits the distribution of “materially deceptive media” that portrays politicians in a way that risks harming “the reputation or electoral prospects of a candidate.”<br>It also forces distributors of satirical content to post large disclaimers on the satirical nature of the content, which the litigants argue negates the satirical intent.<br>Violators face jail time, large fines, and lawsuits.<br>S2687 makes a first-time violation “a petty misdemeanor.” Haw. Rev. Stat. § 11-303(d). Conviction for a petty misdemeanor can result in a sentence of up to 30 days in prison and a fine of up to $1,000. Haw Rev. Stat. §§ 701- 107(4), 706-640(1)(e).<br>A second violation “within five years of a previous conviction for” S2687 is “a misdemeanor.” Haw. Rev. Stat. § 11-303(e). Conviction for a misdemeanor can carry a sentence of imprisonment of up to one year and a fine of up to $2,000. Haw Rev. Stat. §§ 701-107(3), 706-640(1)(d).<br>Violating S2687 “with the intent to cause violence or bodily harm” is “a class C felony.” Haw. Rev. Stat. § 11-303(f). Conviction for a class C felony can carry a sentence of imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of up to $10,000. Haw Rev. Stat. §§ 706-660(1)(b), 706-640(1)(c).<br>The law is enforceable for nine months before every election, with exemptions for “disclaimers, broadcasters, and interactive computer services.”<br>The Bablyon Bee and a Christian satire website are among the challengers to the law. Alliance Defending Freedom is representing the litigants.<br>Astonishingly, only one legislator voted against the law in Hawaii despite opposition from the Hawaii Office of the Public Defender and Hollywood’s chief lobbying group.

Photo: brehman/epa-efe/shutterstock/Shutterstock<br>Rounding up and deporting millions of illegal migrants was never going to go down without protest. But President Trump is determined to do it, and no one can say he didn’t tell voters during the campaign. But there are risks for both sides of this dispute, and especially for the country if it turns violent and triggers a military response from the White House.<br>The weekend’s clashes in Los Angeles are a sign of what could be ahead. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been staging raids around the city hunting for migrants, including at businesses where they are thought to work. Workers, union leaders and pro-migrant activists hit the streets in protest.<br>The clashes turned nasty in some places, some officers were hurt, and ICE and local police made arrests, including of a prominent union leader for interfering with federal officers. President Trump then invoked a little-used law to override what is typically state control and sent in 2,000 troops from the California National Guard. Cue the outrage from Democrats and cries of law-breaking on both sides.<br>***<br>Mr. Trump has largely solved the country’s most urgent immigration problem, which is closing the border to migrants using asylum claims to gain entry. Illegal border crossings have slowed to a trickle in four months. ICE has also arrested dangerous gang members and others accused of crimes in the U.S. On this Mr. Trump has overwhelming public support.<br>But the White House, led by deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, wants to deport everyone here illegally. This means millions of people who arrived illegally but have since led law-abiding, productive lives. They have formed families and taken jobs that employers say they struggle to fill-in construction, hospitality, agriculture, healthcare, and much more.<br>Mr. Miller and the restrictionists want to deport everyone to send a message never to come again. But the lost contributions to the U.S. labor force will be great, especially since neither Mr. Miller nor Big Labor will tolerate more legal immigration. The labor-market impact is already showing up in the monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report.<br>There is also the risk of unrest, as we’ve seen in California. It’s fanciful to think that raiding restaurants to snatch busboys, or Home Depot to grab stock clerks, won’t inspire a backlash. All the more so when ICE acts in heavy-handed fashion, as its agents sometimes do. Some on the pro-migrant left will do the same, and that’s when things get ugly. The political risks for Mr. Trump will grow if families are broken up, legal migrants are deported by mistake, or tales of hardship proliferate.<br>Yet Mr. Trump can fairly say he has a mandate for mass deportation, however unwise, and he has broad legal authority to do it. That seems to include his call out of the California Guard. He used a provision in a law rarely invoked to deploy the Guard despite no request from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass or Gov. Gavin Newsom.<br>A White House statement cited “violent mobs” and the “invasion of illegal criminals” to justify deploying the Guard under the statute, which may be challenged in court. Our guess is that the White House had teed up this authority to use when needed, and Mr. Trump was itching to do so. He knows Americans don’t like protests that include burning tires or broad disruptions of commercial traffic and public order.<br>Mr. Newsom says there was no need to call in the Guard, and that may be true, but that means Democrats who run “sanctuary” cities or states need to maintain order. If they tolerate obstruction against ICE, they are giving Mr. Trump an excuse to call in the military. When Rep. Maxine Waters says she wants the protesting crowds to “grow and grow and grow,” she is playing into Mr. Trump’s hands.<br>The California Governor is right that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was needlessly provocative in tweeting that Marines at Camp Pendleton are on alert to intervene if asked. The country doesn’t want the military patrolling American streets except in the worst circumstances. But Mr. Trump could invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy the military, as George H.W. Bush did to quell the 1992 L.A. riots, and our guess is that the President and Mr. Miller are looking for the chance.<br>***<br>This is the tragedy of American immigration politics in 2025. The Biden Administration’s de facto open-border policy created mayhem and costs that have changed the immigration debate for the worse. Border security was one of Mr. Trump’s most popular issues in 2024. This means he has leeway to solve the problem. He may go too far, as he so often does, but Democrats should look in the mirror for giving him the political opening.<br>We’d call for common sense on both sides, but that’s probably not in the offing.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R35" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">36</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/8/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">VỆ BINH QUỐC GIA ĐÃ VÀO LOS ANGELES DẸP LOẠN!<br>Tường thuật trên WSJ cho thấy sẽ khó tái diễn nạn cướp bóc như trước làm Thống đốc Gary Newsom đang loay hoay!

Much of this effort is carried out to combat disinformation or radicalism. The subjectivity of such “Prevent” standards is evident in a new media report that officers are being trained to look for “cultural nationalism,” including those people who are concerned that Western culture is under threat from mass migration. Such concerns are now viewed as indicative of “right-wing terrorist ideology.”<br>Europe, like the United States, is showing a surge in political support for politicians seeking to limit and reverse mass immigration into their countries. That includes Great Britain.<br>The material is part of an online training course for British hospitals, schools, universities, and other public institutions that are expected to identify and report extremists to the government.<br>The training would subject a large number of British citizens to potential investigation as right-wing extremists. In 2023, a government report by William Shawcross concluded “populist conservative voices who have nothing to do with violent extremism” are often identified by investigators even though the overwhelming number of attacks committed in the UK were “Islamist in nature.”<br>There have also been warnings that by classifying “cultural nationalism” as an indication of extremism, the anti-terror scheme could be used to stifle public debate.<br>A Home Office spokesman insisted, however, that “Prevent is not about restricting debate or free speech, but about protecting those susceptible to radicalisation.”<br>That is a rationale already used in the UK to arrest those with dangerous thoughts or viewpoints.<br>For years, I have been writing about the decline of free speech in the United Kingdom and the steady stream of arrests, including in my book, The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage.<br>A man was convicted of sending a tweet while drunk, referring to dead soldiers. Another was arrested for wearing an anti-police t-shirt. Another was arrested for calling the Irish boyfriend of his ex-girlfriend a “leprechaun.” Yet another was arrested for singing “Kung Fu Fighting.” A teenager was arrested for protesting outside of a Scientology center with a sign calling the religion a “cult.”<br>Nicholas Brock, 52, was convicted of a thought crime in Maidenhead, Berkshire. The neo-Nazi was given a four-year sentence for what the court called his “toxic ideology” based on the contents of the home he shared with his mother in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Judge Peter Lodder QC dismissed free speech or free thought concerns with a truly Orwellian statement:<br>    “I do not sentence you for your political views, but the extremity of those views informs the assessment of dangerousness.”<br>Lodder lambasted Brock for holding Nazi and other hateful values:<br>    “[i]t is clear that you are a right-wing extremist, your enthusiasm for this repulsive and toxic ideology is demonstrated by the graphic and racist iconography which you have studied and appeared to share with others…”<br>Recently, the UK effectively resumed blasphemy prosecutions and previously arrested a woman for silently praying to herself near an abortion clinic.<br>The training captures the potential chilling effect on speech where any publicly stated concerns over immigration and Western Civilization could lead to your being reported to the police. It reflects the cavalier approach to such speech regulations in not just the UK but throughout Europe.  However, this European model is being promoted by many in the United States, including some who are calling on the European Union to challenge the United States over the regulation of speech.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R37" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">38</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/8/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">DI DÂN TẠI ANH QUỐC VÀ GIÁO DỤC TẠI HOA KỲ<br>Sau bài phân tách của Konstantin Kisin vừa được giới thiệu trên Dainamax về sự chuyển dịch dân số vì di dân tại Anh Quốc, xin quý vị đọc lá thư độc giả sau đây trên Wall Street Journal về trào lưu ‘critical theory’ trong hệ thống giáo dục Hoa Kỳ.

Photo: Getty Images<br>Santa Clara, Calif.<br>I’m a graduate student in marriage and family therapy at Santa Clara University, a Jesuit institution. Recently, I walked out of class. Prof. Chongzheng Wei had just played a video of a female “influencer” engaging in sexual bondage activity. When the lights came up, the professor smiled and asked if we wanted to try it ourselves. Maybe it was a crass joke to break the tension, but I didn’t want to find out if a live demonstration was next.<br>What began as a simple accommodation request in a required course called Human Sexuality turned into a case study in the reshaping of therapy training - not by science but by critical theory, a worldview that filters human experience through left-wing assumptions about power, oppression and identity, particularly regarding race, “gender” and sexuality.<br>The first time I enrolled in the course, students were assigned to read sadomasochistic erotica and a book called “The Guide to Getting It On,” featuring sexually explicit illustrations. We were told to write an eight- to 10-page “comprehensive sexual autobiography,” which could include early sexual memories, masturbation, current experiences, and future goals with an action plan - all uploaded to a third-party platform for grading. The syllabus allowed that students “are not required to disclose anything that causes extreme discomfort,” but that disclaimer rang hollow attached to an assignment requiring us to discuss such personal matters.<br>On ethical and religious grounds, I requested an alternative assignment. Cary Watson, the department chairman, denied my request, suggesting I change my plans and pursue a different type of license. In an email, she described the course as “an ‘inoculation’ of sorts... exposing you to content you *might* come across” as a licensed therapist. She told me that if I did encounter such things in a professional setting, I could “assuredly communicate that discomfort” to clients and decline to work with them. So why did it have to be part of my training?<br>I appealed to the dean, the provost, the Title IX office, the university president and even Campus Ministry. I’m not sure who was more shocked, the priest reading the syllabus or me, screen-sharing sexually explicit videos and images with him.<br>The course is a graduation requirement, so I re-enrolled with Mr. Wei, who is new to the school. I requested the same accommodation that Ms. Watson said “Muslim women students” had received: to complete the course remotely. Mr. Wei instead scheduled a Zoom meeting with me. He promised a professional tone and said sexual disclosure wouldn’t be required.<br>But in the classroom, among other things, he showed a how-to bondage video featuring a submissive wearing a “gimp suit” (a full-body garment designed to restrict movement) and played songs like “WAP” and “I Beat My Meat” - racial slurs included. A guest speaker, a male transgender psychologist, told us “only trans women have p—s that can blow up the world” and described being sexually aroused while looking in the mirror. One exercise included anonymously writing down something we disliked about our genitals or breasts, to be read aloud in class by another student.<br>I again requested to complete the course remotely. I was told no - I could drop the course or be dropped. Ms. Watson granted a “one-time exception”: take the W (for withdrawal, not win), pay out of pocket for a continuing-education course to fulfill licensure requirements, and enroll in an extra three units at Santa Clara to be eligible to graduate. When I asked for a tuition refund, she called my request “astonishing.” My objections weren’t treated as signs of a systemic issue but as a personal grievance to be managed quietly. (Ms. Watson didn’t respond to a request for comment from my editor at the Journal. Mr. Wei referred the editor’s inquiry to a university spokeswoman, who offered no comment on the record.)<br>When I went public anonymously on Substack, I realized I had stumbled onto something larger. The entire field of educating therapy has been hollowed out and filled in with critical theory. Therapists are no longer trained to be neutral; they’re trained to be agents of political change. Concepts like modesty and marital privacy aren’t merely treated as optional or even dismissed. They’re seen as oppressive norms to be actively combated.<br>In Multicultural Counseling, we were told that “objective, rational, linear thinking,” “delayed gratification,” and making a “plan for the future” are traits of “white culture.” I was required to preface mock therapy sessions by “naming my whiteness” and warning that I might misread clients because of my race. In Human Sexuality, we were taught that children with six months of “gender distress” should be “affirmed” in their belief that they are of the opposite sex - without deeper assessment, even when trauma or autism was present.<br>These ideas are being promoted by the field’s top bodies. The American Psychological Association, American Counseling Association and Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs have adopted standards grounded in critical theory.<br>Therapists influence decisions about “gender transition,” family custody, school discipline and even criminal sentencing. When clinicians are trained to see everything through an ideological lens, rather than with ethical neutrality, the consequences extend far beyond the therapy room.<br>I’m 26, newly married, mother of a 1-year-old girl and a few credits from graduating. I pursued every institutional channel available. I even sought short-term therapy through campus mental-health services, which I was denied. A staff psychologist told me that my department has a history of demanding intimate self-disclosure from students - a practice he regards as unethical.<br>Speaking up comes with risk. But in a field where dissent is discouraged and students are coerced, I’ve chosen to say: No more.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R38" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">39</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/8/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">CÓ NHỮNG NGƯỜI LÀM CHÚNG TA SUY NGHĨ…<br>Với bản thân tôi, Konstantin Kisin là một thí dụ.

But It Will Be Soon.<br>==============================<br>By Konstantin Kisin - Jun 8 ∙ Paid<br>I still remember my confusion nearly 25 years ago when I read an article on the BBC in which Barbara Roche, Tony Blair’s Immigration Minister, called Britain “a country of migrants”. I was in my last year of school and not remotely political. I found the quote shocking, not because of its political implications but simply because I had, up to that point, done my best to educate myself on the history of this country. Nowhere in my reading had I found any justification for the claim that Britain’s history was defined, or even significantly shaped by, immigration.<br>Before we look at the facts, it is worth observing that Roche’s claim is now widely regarded as self-evident. When I once challenged the notion that Britain was a nation of immigrants on Iain Dale’s LBC show, Iain was shocked and asked me to clarify. Journalists and commentators in our public space regularly claim that immigrants built Britain. I could give example after example but let’s be honest: for all intents and purposes, in the public space this matter has been effectively settled.<br>Until this week, at least.<br>A recent report from the University of Buckingham, produced by Matthew Goodwin, predicts that people born abroad and their descendants will constitute the majority of the British population by 2079. This statistic triggered into action commentators like David Aaronovitch, who responded by claiming that “‘The foreign born and their descendants’ covers just about everyone in the country”.<br>On Question Time, the BBC’s flagship political programme, Mark Serwotka, the former head of one of Britain’s major unions, recently claimed that “Britain is the great country that it is because of centuries of immigration that brought us cultural enrichment, supporting our public services and some of our greatest things” before adding that “we should be proud of it” to inevitable applause.<br>Let’s set the politics aside for a moment and look at the facts.<br>The Norman conquest following the Battle of Hastings in 1066 brought around 5,000 to 10,000 people from what is now France. England’s foreign-born population at that time was in the low single digits, possibly as low as 1%. This remained unchanged for centuries, with a 1440 survey recording just 14,500 foreign-born residents in England (1%). From 1330 to 1550, total immigration is estimated at 65,000 people.<br>During the early modern period, approximately 1,000 people a year came to England over the course of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. These inflows included 50,000 Huguenots, Irish migrants, and Jews returning under Cromwell.<br>The following hundred years saw a significant increase, primarily through a large wave of Irish people fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s. In total, Britain’s foreign born population increased by between 1.5 and 2 million people in the 19th century. If that sounds like a lot, remember that this occurred over 100 years, i.e. an annual increase of 15,000 to 20,000 people. By 1901, Britain’s foreign born population had risen from 0.5% to a whopping 1.5%.<br>The first half of the 20th century saw little change, with between 10,000 and 14,000 arrivals annually. This included immigration related to both world wars and from the Commonwealth. By 1951, the foreign-born population of the UK was 4.4%.<br>Despite significant post-war immigration, between 1951 and 2001, average net migration into Britain is estimated at just 7,800 people a year. Taking the 1990s as a separate decade, it was much higher but still just 40,000 annually.<br>As late as 1996, the year I moved to Britain, net immigration was running at just 55,000 people a year. By this point, the foreign-born population of the UK had risen, but only to 7%.<br>To summarise this barrage of figures: immigrants have played a small but not insignificant role throughout British history, making up a few percent of the population.<br>They did not “build Britain”. Britain was at its peak as a nation during the 19th and early 20th century, losing its dominance in terms of territory, population, wealth and global influence in the wake of WWII.<br>Of course, individual immigrants and their children made significant contributions during this period, including the great engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Michael Marks (the co-founder of Marks &amp; Spencer), and the author Joseph Conrad.<br>But, we must not lose sight of the fact that Britain’s glory days were built by its native population.<br>The reason we are having this nonsensical debate, of course, is that the claim that “Britain is a nation of immigrants” serves two different purposes:<br>First, in a world of global infotainment, the cultures of different countries, especially in the English-speaking world, are converging. This is why British TV channels and column inches are filled with commentary about American politics, and why American commentators tweet themselves into a rage over events here in Britain. The phrase “a nation of immigrants” is a foolish and misguided import from our American cousins, in whose context it is actually relevant and true. The uneducated, uninformed and, often dishonest elements of British progressivism use this phrase for the same reason BLM protestors in London chanted “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” at British police officers who do not carry guns: unthinking mimicry.<br>But the second reason we keep being told that Britain is a nation of immigrants is to conceal the fact that while this has never been true, it will be soon.<br>It is not remotely an exaggeration to say that a time-traveller from the 1990s would not recognise the country we live in today. Even London, which always had a significant foreign-born population (21.7% in 1991), was an obviously and unquestionably English city when I first came to Britain. Today, over 40%  of Londoners are foreign-born, and people who identify as “white British” make up less than  37% of the population (36.8% in the 2021 census).<br>In other words, a country once made up of people whose ancestors lived here for centuries is becoming a nation of immigrants.<br>It is immediately assumed that any concern about this reality is based on bigotry, prejudice and xenophobia. This is interesting to me because in 1996, when I first arrived, just 3% of British people thought that immigration was a major issue. Why did this change?<br>The election of Tony Blair the following year. His government flung open the doors, with net migration during Labour’s 13 years in power reaching 200,000 annually. From 2010 onwards, the British people’s concern about this issue shot up sharply, and they repeatedly voted for parties that promised to control immigration. In the year before the Brexit referendum (between June 2015 and June 2016) immigration was consistently named as the most salient issue facing the country, peaking at 56% in September 2015. Since the referendum, the British people have voted for politicians who promised to reduce immigration at every single opportunity, including in 2017, 2019 and 2024, when Reform took millions of votes away from Labour and the Tories over this issue.<br>Despite this, net immigration from 2010 to 2024 totalled 5.2 million people, or 371,000 a year. In 2023 alone, it approached 1 million.<br>As a result, the foreign-born population of this country has quadrupled as a percentage in just 75 years, from 4% in 1951 to approximately 17% in 2025. White British people are already a minority in Britain’s 3 biggest cities: London (36.8%), Birmingham (42.9%) and Manchester (48.7%), as well as in Leicester (33.2%), Luton (31.8%) and Slough (34.5%). By the next census, Bradford, Coventry, Wolverhampton and Nottingham are expected to join them.<br>You may not think this matters. You may not care. You may, in fact, think this is great. But these are the facts and we should state them plainly.<br>Britain has never been a nation of immigrants, but it will have been made one in the next few decades by a series of Labour and Conservative Governments—despite the clearly and repeatedly expressed democratic wishes of the British people, who have been thoroughly and comprehensively ignored.<br>P.S. Before sharing this article with your friends and family, please be aware that the Government’s Prevent anti-radicalisation programme has recently declared that concern about mass immigration is “terrorist ideology”. A Prevent training course hosted on  the Government’s website lists “cultural nationalism” as something that could cause you to be referred for deradicalisation.<br>Prevent, you’ll remember, is the programme to which the Southport murderer Axel Rudakubana was repeatedly referred from as young as 13. He went on to stab a number of children and adults, 3 of whom died.<br>Usman Khan, the terrorist who committed the London Bridge attack in 2019, was under Prevent monitoring when he carried out his attack in the middle of a prisoner rehabilitation event for which he had travelled to London. Prevent officers tasked with monitoring him had “no specific training” in dealing with terrorists.<br>According to the Prevent training guidance, if you believe that “Western culture is under threat from mass migration and a lack of integration by certain ethnic and cultural groups” you will be referred to the very programme which failed to deal with them.<br>This is Britain.

AP/Peter Dejong, file<br>THE NEW YORK SUN<br>(THE NEW YORK SUN Jun. 6, 2025 06:13 PM ET)<br>Globalists, America-detractors, and Israel-bashers are irate as Washington is waging a campaign to cut a Hague-based kangaroo court down to size. This is reaction to President Trump’s imposition yesterday of sanctions on four judges of the International Criminal Court. Critics act as if he and Secretary Rubio have turned their backs on the Magna Carta. Some urge the ICC to place Messrs. Trump and Rubio themselves in its dock.  <br>Two of the four sanctioned judges authorized an investigation into Americans who had fought against terrorists in Afghanistan. The other two rubber-stamped global arrest warrants against Prime Minister Netanyahu and a former Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant. The judges will now be banned from doing business in America or using the dollar in their transactions. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, was similarly sanctioned back in February.<br>“Attacks against judges for performance of their judicial functions run directly counter to respect for the rule of law and the equal protection of the law - values for which the U.S. has long stood,” the United Nations’s human rights chief, Volker Turk, wrote in a scathing statement. A former head of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, urges the ICC to try the Americans for “obstructing justice under Article 70 of the Rome Statute.”<br>That would be a stretch longer than the limousines that carry esteemed officials through the streets of the Dutch city that hosts the international venue. The Rome Statute is the reason the Hague judges raised America’s ire in the first place. America and Israel declined to ratify that treaty, which founded the ICC. Yet, the judges launched investigations and issued global arrest warrants on citizens of these non-member countries.<br>It is “meaningless to invoke it against a country that is in no way legally obliged to those provisions,” the executive director of UN Watch, Hillel Neuer, tells our Benny Avni. Indeed, Article 13b of the Rome Statute allows prosecuting non-members only if the UN Security Council, where America has a veto power, refers cases to it. Yet the ICC judges launched an investigation of alleged war crimes committed by Americans in the Afghanistan war.    <br>The ICC “did an end run” around its own rules, Mr. Neuer says. As the failed state of Afghanistan is its member, it reasoned, it has jurisdiction over crimes committed there. It also allowed “Palestine” to join the ICC so it could prosecute alleged war crimes in Gaza. Never mind that the Ramallah officials who “ratified” the Rome Statute and complained of alleged Israeli crimes can’t even get near the Hamas-dominated Strip.<br>Mr. Khan suddenly leaped to demand the arrest of Israeli officials just when a female underling complained that he had abused her sexually. “Any power can be corrupted, and the power of prosecution is very significant,” Mr. Neuer notes. Yet in democracies there are ways to curb abuse of these powers. Are ICC judges any different than, say, the Milwaukee judge arrested for obstructing justice by protecting a person wanted by ICE?<br>The ICC was modeled after the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals. Instead of sticking to norms that have guided jurists in democracies for time immemorial, though, it has become a hotbed of global politics. Several countries have threatened to de-ratify the Rome Statute, claiming the court prosecutes only Africans. America and Israel became extra-legal targets, the rules be damned. Washington is right to seek a course correction.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R41" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">42</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/7/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">BÀI HỌC LỊCH SỬ VỀ PUTIN CHO TÂY PHƯƠNG – VÀ TRUMP!<br>George Will là bỉnh bút cánh hữu cho tờ Washington Post và hệ thống truyền hình NBC (cùng MSNBC), nhưng cũng cộng tác với NY Sun.

Sergei Bobylev/RIA Novosti via AP<br>GEORGE WILL<br>(By GEORGE WILL - NY Sun - Jun. 7, 2025 03:50 AM ET)<br>Recently, 20,000 people were evacuated from the center of the German city of Cologne because of a timely reminder from the past: three unexploded bombs dropped on the pulverized city during World War II. A thousand miles to the east, reverberations from explosions in Ukraine are part of Europe’s present. And of its foreseeable future, in part because of past misjudgments.<br>Consider 1994. That was three years after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. And five years after American political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s influential essay argued that humanity’s ideological evolution had culminated in “the end of history”: the exhaustion of all social systems hitherto considered plausible alternatives to open, liberal societies.<br>In 1994, Ukraine surrendered the Soviet-era nuclear weapons it possessed, receiving in exchange American, British, French, Russian, and Communist Chinese security guarantees. Twenty years later, Russia seized Crimea. And began supporting insurrections aimed at dismembering Ukraine.<br>Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs from 2020 to 2024, Dmytro Kuleba, writing in Foreign Affairs, says, “The stark reality is that neither Russia nor Ukraine has much of an incentive to stop the fighting.” What President Putin calls “the root causes of the conflict” are really one cause: Ukraine’s existence as a sovereign nation.<br>Although there is no excuse for it, there is a reason for the failure of American leaders to understand Mr. Putin. He is an open book who has been reading himself to the world since long before he published his 2021 essay “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians.” <br>This farrago of ethnic mysticisms and history seen through a pseudo-theological lens is Putin’s “Mein Kampf.” His resentments and revenge aspirations are all there. Yet are largely ignored or disbelieved by the West’s statesmen and publics who complacently believe that the end of history meant the end of toxic nonsense such as this:<br>Mr. Putin believes Russia is a “civilization-state” with cultural-cum-religious significance, rights and responsibilities that justify the erasure of other nations. Which is why the Economist correctly says that for Mr. Putin “war has become an ideology.”<br>What Johns Hopkins University’s Hal Brands describes as Mr. Putin’s “quasi-genocidal barbarities” are committed in the name of a totalizing, uncompromisable objective: the political and cultural extinction of Ukraine. Russia has kidnapped, for the purpose of “Russification,” uncountable thousands of Ukrainian children. Their return is, President Zelensky says, Kyiv’s “number one” priority in negotiations. Try explaining that to Steve Witkoff.<br>This real estate developer, Mr. Trump’s designated war-ender, says he and Mr. Putin have developed a “friendship.” Witkoff echoes President Carter’s secretary of state, Cyrus Vance, saying that Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev shares similar “dreams and aspirations” Mr. Witkoff wonders, “Why would [Russia] want to absorb Ukraine?” Mr. Putin explained in his 2021 essay, which shows that peace is impossible.<br>In 1991, Crimea, like the rest of Ukraine, voted for independence. In 2018, the first Trump administration’s Crimea Declaration said “the United States reaffirms as policy its refusal to recognize the Kremlin’s claims of sovereignty over territory seized by force in contravention of international law.” <br>Mr. Trump’s State Department said this would be U.S. policy “until Ukraine’s territorial integrity is restored.” In 2022, Senator Rubio sponsored a bill that would have forbidden American acknowledgment of Russian sovereignty over seized Ukrainian territory. Recently, however, the elastic Mr. Trump breezily said Crimea was “lost years ago.”<br>The end of history has not yet reached Europe. Writing in Foreign Affairs, Theodore Bunzel and Elina Ribakova recall a prophecy from a founder of the European Union, Jean Monnet: “Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.” <br>Unintended beneficial consequences of Mr. Putin’s catastrophic blunder in Ukraine include NATO’s enlargement (Finland and Sweden), revitalization of the American defense industrial base and renewed seriousness about Europe’s self-defense.<br>In a 1951 letter to a friend, an American contemporary of Monnet said that the challenge then was “how to inspire Europe to produce for itself those armed forces that, in the long run, must provide the only means by which Europe can be defended.” So wrote someone with firsthand experience of European dangers, General Dwight Eisenhower, later to be elected president.<br>Today, the American Enterprise Institute’s Dalibor Rohac writes: “The good news is that we know for a fact, based on the experience of the past three years, that even a relatively small and poor country such as Ukraine - never mind the top-shelf militaries of Poland or Finland - can stop Russia in its tracks, with what has been modest U.S. and international support.” This reality has escaped the notice of “realists” who think Ukraine is flimsy.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R42" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">43</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/7/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỘT TÊN ĐẠO TẶC HẠ CÁNH Ê CHỀ!<br>Giáo sư Jonathan Turley gián tiếp cho chúng ta thấy đảng Dân Chủ và truyền thông cánh tả đã ngu lại còn gian trong vụ án của tên đạo tặc người El Salvador là Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

Regardless of the outcome of the criminal prosecution, one thing seems virtually certain: Abrego Garcia will eventually go home... to El Salvador.<br>Here is the column:<br>Kilmar Abrego Garcia is coming back to the United States, but he is hardly thrilled by the prospect. He is returning not for a removal hearing, but for a trial that could result in a lengthy prison sentence, followed by immediate removal back to El Salvador. After the issuance of the federal grand jury, the United States is now the last place on Earth that Abrego Garcia wants to visit.<br>Abrego Garcia has been fighting to return after he was mistakenly removed to El Salvador. That immediately drew irate orders from a federal judge, and many of us argued that the Administration should have simply brought him back for what seemed an easy case for removal after a hearing.<br>Instead, the case dragged on for months after the Trump Administration challenged the court orders as judicial overreach and unconstitutional. The indictment issued by a federal grand jury allows the Administration to end the controversy on its terms. Rather than yielding to the challenged orders, it can bring Abrego Garcia back to stand trial.<br>It is an example of the old adage “one day on the cover of Time, next day doing time.” Sometimes notoriety can be your undoing.<br>If Abrego Garcia had been removed, little attention would likely have been drawn to his prior conduct. Indeed, as all the Democratic politicians, such as Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), arrived in El Salvador with an army of reporters, one has to wonder if Abrego Garcia was having second thoughts about his challenge.<br>While news organizations like NPR described Abrego Garcia as a family man “living quietly” in Maryland, the facts proved far more damning. He was repeatedly accused of beating his wife. The court record also included allegations of his involvement in a notorious gang:<br>    “Per the Prince George’s County Police Gang Unit, ABREGO-Garcia was validated as a member of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) Gang. Subject was identified as a member of the Mara Salvatrucha MS-13, “Chequeo” from the Western Clique a transnational criminal street gang. This information was provided by tested source who has provided truthful accurate information in the past. See Prince Georges County Police Department (Gang Sheet).”<br>MS-13 is designated as a terrorist organization.<br>Abrego Garcia was also suspected of human trafficking. Indeed, the description of the stop leaves one astonished that he was allowed to drive away. According to DHS:<br>    “On Dec. 1, 2022, Abrego Garcia was stopped by the Tennessee Highway Patrol for speeding. Upon approach to the vehicle, the encountering officer noted eight other individuals in the vehicle. There was no luggage in the vehicle, leading the encountering officer to suspect this was a human trafficking incident. Additionally, all the passengers gave the same home address as the subject’s home address. During the interview, Abrego Garcia pretended to speak less English than he was capable of and attempted to put the encountering officer off-track by responding to questions with questions. When asked what relationship he had with the registered owner of the vehicle, Abrego Garcia replied that the owner of the vehicle is his boss, and that he worked in construction…<br>    The encountering officer decided not to cite the subject for driving infractions but gave him a warning citation for driving with an expired driver’s license. Abrego Garcia’s driver’s license was a MD “Limited Term Temporary” license. The encountering officer gathered names of other occupants in the vehicle but could not read their handwriting. The officer did not pursue further information due to no citation being issued.”<br>The videotape mystified many with how Abrego Garcia was allowed to go along his way. Here was an undocumented immigrant stopped with an expired license in a car with eight others traveling from Texas to Maryland. He gave a false statement, and the officer suspected human trafficking but let him go.<br>It is alleged that the person whom Abrego Garcia described as his “boss” at a construction job was Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes, an illegal migrant previously convicted of human smuggling. The black 2001 Chevrolet Suburban belonged to Hernandez Reyez.<br>Now, the indictment details a broader array of evidence. The grand jury found evidence of extensive human trafficking violations over 9 years. The indictment speaks of cooperating witnesses prepared to implicate Abrego Garcia in an international smuggling operation involving guns, narcotics, and humans that included over a 100 such transports.<br>    “Over the course of the conspiracy the coconspirators knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens who had no authorization to be present in the United States and many of whom were MS 13 members and associates The co conspirators also worked with transnational criminal organizations in Mexico to transport undocumented aliens through Mexico and into the United States.”<br>Ironically, in light of this indictment, any criminal defense attorney worth his salt would have opposed deportation to the United States from El Salvador. Instead, Abrego Garcia will face a much longer possible criminal sentence. He will eventually then be deported to El Salvador regardless of the outcome of the criminal prosecution.  Abrego Garcia never had a compelling basis for remaining in the United States. He gamed the system for years, a system that seems utterly incapable of dealing with this national emergency.<br>He will get due process, but make no mistake about it. Abrego Garcia is coming back, but he is not coming home.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R43" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">44</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/7/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">THẾ NÀY MỚI LÀ ÂM MƯU CHỨ!<br>Bộ Quốc Phòng Hoa Kỳ có âm mưu che giấu sự thật về vật lạ bay trên không gian, UFO (Unidentified Flying Objets) mà ta ưa gọi là đĩa bay.

He gave the owner photos of what might be flying saucers. The photos went up on the walls, and into the local lore went the idea that the U.S. military was secretly testing recovered alien technology.<br>But the colonel was on a mission - of disinformation. The photos were doctored, the now-retired officer confessed to the Pentagon investigators in 2023. The whole exercise was a ruse to protect what was really going on at Area 51: The Air Force was using the site to develop top-secret stealth fighters, viewed as a critical edge against the Soviet Union. Military leaders were worried that the programs might get exposed if locals somehow glimpsed a test flight of, say, the F-117 stealth fighter, an aircraft that truly did look out of this world. Better that they believe it came from Andromeda.<br>This episode, reported now for the first time, was just one of a series of discoveries the Pentagon team made as it investigated decades of claims that Washington was hiding what it knew about extraterrestrial life. That effort culminated in a report, released last year by the Defense Department, that found allegations of a government coverup to be baseless.<br>In fact, a Wall Street Journal investigation reveals, the report itself amounted to a coverup - but not in the way the UFO conspiracy industry would have people believe. The public disclosure left out the truth behind some of the foundational myths about UFOs: The Pentagon itself sometimes deliberately fanned the flames, in what amounted to the U.S. government targeting its own citizens with disinformation.<br>At the same time, the very nature of Pentagon operations - an opaque bureaucracy that kept secret programs embedded within secret programs, cloaked in cover stories - created fertile ground for the myths to spread.<br>These findings represent a stunning new twist in the story of America’s cultural obsession with UFOs. In the decades after a 1938 radio broadcast of H.G. Wells’ “The War of the Worlds” spread panic throughout the country, speculation about alien visitors remained largely the province of supermarket tabloids, Hollywood blockbusters and costumed conferences in Las Vegas. <br>More recently, things took an ominous turn when a handful of former Pentagon officials went public with allegations of a government program to exploit extraterrestrial technology and hide it from Americans. Those claims led to the Pentagon’s investigation.<br>Now, evidence is emerging that government efforts to propagate UFO mythology date back all the way to the 1950s. <br>A night view of the &#39;Extraterrestrial Highway&#39; near Area 51. Mikayla Whitmore for WSJ<br>This account is based on interviews with two dozen current and former U.S. officials, scientists and military contractors involved in the inquiry, as well as thousands of pages of documents, recordings, emails and text messages. <br>At times, as with the deception around Area 51, military officers spread false documents to create a smokescreen for real secret-weapons programs. In other cases, officials allowed UFO myths to take root in the interest of national security - for instance, to prevent the Soviet Union from detecting vulnerabilities in the systems protecting nuclear installations. Stories tended to take on a life of their own, such as the three-decade journey of a purported piece of space metal that turned out to be nothing of the sort. And one long-running practice was more like a fraternity hazing ritual that spun wildly out of control.<br>Investigators are still trying to determine whether the spread of disinformation was the act of local commanders and officers or a more centralized, institutional program. <br>The Pentagon omitted key facts in the public version of the 2024 report that could have helped put some UFO rumors to rest, both to protect classified secrets and to avoid embarrassment, the Journal investigation found. The Air Force in particular pushed to omit some details it believed could jeopardize secret programs and damage careers.<br>The lack of full transparency has only given more fuel to conspiracy theories. Members of Congress have formed a caucus, composed mainly of Republicans, to examine unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP, in bureaucratic speak. The caucus has demanded the intelligence community disclose which agencies “are involved with UAP crash retrieval programs.”<br>MAGA skepticism about the “deep state” further feeds the notion that government bureaucrats have been keeping those secrets from the American public. At a November hearing of two House Oversight subcommittees, Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, cast doubt on the Pentagon’s report. “I’m not a mathematician, but I can tell you that doesn’t add up,” she said. <br>A guard stands at an entrance to the Nevada Test and Training Range near Area 51 in 2019. John Locher/Associated Press<br>‘Stupid enough’<br>Sean Kirkpatrick, a precise, bespectacled scientist who once spent years studying vibrations in laser crystals, was nearing retirement from government service when he received the call that would change his life.<br>By 2022 he had ascended to chief scientist at the Missile and Space Intelligence Center at the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Ala. As he sat at his desk at 6:30 one morning, drinking coffee and skimming through intelligence reports that had come in overnight, his Tandberg desk phone - essentially a classified version of FaceTime -rang. <br>It was a deputy undersecretary from the Pentagon, who was putting on a tie as he told Kirkpatrick about a new office Congress ordered the department to set up to examine unidentified anomalous phenomena. “The undersecretary and I put together a shortlist of who could do it, and you’re at the top,” the official relayed, adding that they had settled on Kirkpatrick because he both had a scientific background and had built a half-dozen organizations within the intelligence community.<br>Is that the real reason, Kirkpatrick countered, “or am I the only one stupid enough to say, ‘yes?’”<br>In short order, Kirkpatrick had the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office up and running. Just the latest in an alphabet soup of special government projects set up to study UFOs stretching back more than half a century, AARO, as it is known, operated out of an unmarked office near the Pentagon, with a few dozen staffers and a classified budget.<br>The mission fell into two buckets. One was to collect data on sightings, particularly around military installations, and assess whether they could be explained by earthly technology. Amid growing public attention, the number of such reports has skyrocketed in recent years, to 757 in the 12 months after May 2023 from 144 between 2004 to 2021. AARO linked most of the incidents to balloons, birds and the proliferation of drones cluttering the skies.<br>Many pilot accounts of floating orbs were actually reflections of the sun from Starlink satellites, investigators found. They are still examining whether some unexplained events could be foreign technology, such as Chinese aircraft using next-generation cloaking methods that distort their appearance.<br>Sean Kirkpatrick, the first director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, has retired to a mountaintop retreat. Angela Owens/WSJ<br>The office found that some seemingly inexplicable events weren’t so strange after all. In one, a 2015 video appeared to show a spherical object buzzing past a jet fighter at an almost impossible speed. “Oh, my gosh dude,” the pilot can be heard saying in the video, laughing. But later, investigators determined there was nothing much to see - whatever the object was, the camera angle and relative speed of the jet had made it appear to be going much faster than it was.<br>The office’s second mission proved to be more peculiar: to review the historical record going back to 1945 to assess the claims made by dozens of former military employees that Washington operated a secret program to harvest alien technology. Congress granted the office unprecedented access to America’s most highly classified programs to allow Kirkpatrick’s team to run the stories to ground. <br>As Kirkpatrick pursued his investigation, he started to uncover a hall of mirrors within the Pentagon, cloaked in official and nonofficial cover. On one level, the secrecy was understandable. The U.S., after all, had been locked in an existential battle with the Soviet Union for decades, each side determined to win the upper hand in the race for ever-more-exotic weapons. <br>But Kirkpatrick soon discovered that some of the obsession with secrecy verged on the farcical. A former Air Force officer was visibly terrified when he told Kirkpatrick’s investigators that he had been briefed on a secret alien project decades earlier, and was warned that if he ever repeated the secret he could be jailed or executed. The claim would be repeated to investigators by other men who had never spoken of the matter, even with their spouses. <br>It turned out the witnesses had been victims of a bizarre hazing ritual. <br>For decades, certain new commanders of the Air Force’s most classified programs, as part of their induction briefings, would be handed a piece of paper with a photo of what looked like a flying saucer. The craft was described as an antigravity maneuvering vehicle. <br>An F-117 Nighthawk flies over the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range in 2002 near Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Thomas J. Pitsor/USAF/Getty Images<br>The officers were told that the program they were joining, dubbed Yankee Blue, was part of an effort to reverse-engineer the technology on the craft. They were told never to mention it again. Many never learned it was fake. Kirkpatrick found the practice had begun decades before, and appeared to continue still. The defense secretary’s office sent a memo out across the service in the spring of 2023 ordering the practice to stop immediately, but the damage was done. <br>Investigators are still trying to determine why officers had misled subordinates, whether as some type of loyalty test, a more deliberate attempt to deceive or something else.  <br>After that 2023 discovery, Kirkpatrick’s deputy briefed President Joe Biden’s director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, who was stunned.<br>Could this be the basis for the persistent belief that the U.S. has an alien program that we’ve concealed from the American people? Haines wanted to know, according to people familiar with the matter. How extensive was it? she asked.  <br>The official responded: “Ma’am, we know it went on for decades. We are talking about hundreds and hundreds of people. These men signed NDAs. They thought it was real.“<br>The finding could have been devastating to the Air Force. The service was particularly sensitive to the allegations of hazing and asked that AARO hold off on including the finding in the public report, even after Kirkpatrick had briefed lawmakers on the episode. Kirkpatrick retired before that report was finished and released.  <br>In a statement, a Defense Department spokeswoman acknowledged that AARO had uncovered evidence of fake classified program materials relating to extraterrestrials, and had briefed lawmakers and intelligence officials. The spokeswoman, Sue Gough, said the department didn’t include that information in its report last year because the investigation wasn’t completed, but expects to provide it in another report scheduled for later this year.<br>“The department is committed to releasing a second volume of its Historical Record Report, to include AARO’s findings on reports of potential pranks and inauthentic materials,” Gough said.  <br>UFO kitsch abounds near Hiko, Nev., outside Area 51. Mikayla Whitmore for WSJ<br>A bunker in Montana<br>Kirkpatrick investigated another mystery that stretched back 60 years. <br>In 1967, Robert Salas, now 84, was an Air Force captain sitting in a walk-in closet-sized bunker, manning the controls of 10 nuclear missiles in Montana. <br>He was prepared to launch apocalyptic strikes should Soviet Russia ever attack first, and got a call around 8 p.m. one night from the guard station above. A glowing reddish-orange oval was hovering over the front gate, Salas told Kirkpatrick’s investigators. The guards had their rifles drawn, pointed at the oval object appearing to float above the gate. A horn sounded in the bunker, signaling a problem with the control system: All 10 missiles were disabled. <br>Salas soon learned a similar event occurred at other silos nearby. Were they under attack? Salas never got an answer. The next morning a helicopter was waiting to take Salas back to base. Once there he was ordered: Never discuss the incident. <br>Robert Salas, shown at home in Ojai, Calif. believes to this day that he witnessed an intervention from outer space while working at a nuclear launch site. Maggie Shannon for WSJ<br>Salas was one of five men interviewed by Kirkpatrick’s team who witnessed such events in the 1960s and ’70s. While sworn to secrecy, the men began sharing their stories in the ’90s in books and documentaries. <br>Kirkpatrick’s team dug into the story and discovered a terrestrial explanation. The barriers of concrete and steel surrounding America’s nuclear missiles were thick enough to give them a chance if hit first by a Soviet strike. But scientists at the time feared the intense storm of electromagnetic waves generated by a nuclear detonation might render the hardware needed to launch a counterstrike unusable. <br>A model of an electromagnetic pulse testing site, shown in a 1978 Pentagon document.<br>To test this vulnerability, the Air Force developed an exotic electromagnetic generator that simulated this pulse of disruptive energy without the need to detonate a nuclear weapon.<br>When activated, this device, placed on a portable platform 60 feet above the facility, would gather power until it glowed, sometimes with a blinding orange light. It would then fire a burst of energy that could resemble lightning.<br>A 1973 Pentagon document diagrams a close-up of the part of the equipment that fires an electromagnetic wave that can appear like a bolt of lightning during the test.<br>The electromagnetic pulses snaked down cables connected to the bunker where launch commanders like Salas sat, disrupting the guidance systems, disabling the weapons and haunting the men to this day. <br>But any public leak of the tests at the time would have allowed Russia to know that America’s nuclear arsenal could be disabled in a first strike. The witnesses were kept in the dark.<br>To this day Salas believes he was party to an intergalactic intervention to stop nuclear war which the government has tried to hide. He is half right. The experience left the octogenarian deeply skeptical of the U.S. military and its ability to tell the truth. “There is a gigantic coverup, not only by the Air Force, but every other federal agency that has cognizance of this subject,” he said in an interview with the Journal. “We were never briefed on the activities that were going on, the Air Force shut us out of any information.”<br>Concealing the truth from men like Salas and deliberate efforts to target the public with disinformation unleashed within the halls of the Pentagon itself a dangerous force, which would become almost unstoppable as decades passed. The paranoid mythology the U.S. military helped spread now has a hold over a growing number of its own senior officials who count themselves as believers.<br>The crisis grew to a boil over a piece of metal mailed to a late-night radio host in 1996, which the sender said they had been told was part of a crashed spaceship.<br>Write to Joel Schectman at joel.schectman@wsj.com and Aruna Viswanatha at aruna.viswanatha@wsj.com<br>This article is the first of two parts.

That is the only good outcome in the next 10 years…” (by Joe Lonsdale, Venture Capitalist and SIC speaker<br>(Joe is right, but it is critical you understand why he is right if you want to understand the future. -JM)<br>“The answer to the question “Where will the jobs come from?” is “I don’t know, but they will!” by John Mauldin<br>Today we’ll continue our SIC highlight series featuring a relatively new face who is now indispensable, plus some new ones who were crowd favorites. It is always frustrating to try to pick and choose among the large group of speakers at the conference (44 this year) as to what to highlight. I could literally spend the summer, well, summarizing their thoughts. But as is my tradition, I will stop after a month or so and get back to our regular programming.<br>But you don’t have to miss out. We have created a special SIC transcript package that includes every presentation along with their associated slides. It’s a bargain at only $249 (half the price of the conference) and will likely pay for itself many times over. Click here to order.<br>Now, on with the letter.<br>1/ The Good Kind of Job Destruction<br>----------<br>I’m honored to be friends with Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir and now a storied venture capital investor active in a wide variety of future-focused industries. He’s deeply passionate about applying technology to solve our greatest societal challenges, along with the odd retail venture here there.<br>My SIC conversation with Joe touched on many different topics. I’ll zoom in on only one of them: How AI will change the economy.<br>You’ve heard the fear of AI destroying jobs. Everybody is talking about how Dario Amodei, CEO of leading artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, warning that AI may eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment within the next five years. Here is Joe’s optimistic answer.<br>Let’s start with a quote which begins with provocative sentence (I have slightly edited this section for clarity):<br>         “We desperately as a country want to destroy more jobs. That is the only good outcome in the next 10 years. And what does that mean? Why? Well, this is basic economics. We need productivity to go up. This is why our civilization is so much wealthier today than it was 150 years, 100 years, 50 years… During the Industrial Revolution, you actually had all sorts of destruction of all sorts of suboptimal jobs that were no longer needed and that allowed people to create more wealth, that allowed you to do more with less and it allowed our society to succeed.<br>         “Now, we are in massive debt. We have all sorts of structural issues. If we do not get productivity up, that is going to be a zero-sum world where people are at war, where there&#39;s going to be another form of wokeness again. We&#39;re all going to be fighting each other. We&#39;re going to be tearing down our top builders [through taxes and regulations – JM] because there&#39;s no other source to go after. This will be terrible. The future is going to be dark. Our culture is going to be broken if productivity doesn&#39;t go up.<br>         “If productivity does go up, the world we&#39;re going to be living in, first of all, it&#39;s very disinflationary. It&#39;s going to bring prices down. Second of all, you&#39;re going to cover all of the problems with the wealth creation for any kind of debt, any kind of medical costs the government needs to pay. [The income and taxes from wealth creation are] going to go up.<br>         “And by the way, every single time this has happened, it creates more jobs. And this is where people, I think, are a little bit confused this time. They say, ‘Well, last time, it created more jobs, but this time, can&#39;t AI just do everything.’ Listen, if there&#39;s a world where AI becomes a God and it does everything, jobs are not our problem. So, let&#39;s put that aside for a second. That&#39;s like saying there&#39;s going to be this new all-powerful God and Messiah is here. If Messiah does come, let&#39;s have our religious conversations separately.<br>         “But for now, what&#39;s happening is you are automating certain jobs. There&#39;s still 5 million unfilled vocational jobs. There&#39;s still massive numbers of things that people can do to serve and help and work with others and create value [that AI can’t do].<br>         “The problem right now is not that there&#39;s not enough jobs. The problem, John, is that certain communities in our country do not have enough agency and they don&#39;t have functional cultures. If you have a place where there&#39;s someone with agency and a functional culture, they will have a job right now.<br>         “So it is just the opposite concern what we should have. The main concern is that productivity doesn&#39;t go up. I&#39;m on the exact opposite side of this and I&#39;m confident I&#39;m correct. We want to destroy jobs in order to lift up society, in order to push things forward and then there will be lots of things for people to do.”<br>One thought before we continue. His point about agency is critical. Having agency means that a person has the capacity to act independently and make their own choices, influencing their life and circumstances. It reflects their ability to fulfill their potential and take control over their actions and decisions.<br>When Joe is talking about communities not having agency, he’s not talking about physical locations or cities, but various groups frustrated at a lack of control over their own lives. One of the driving forces of economics, and one of the reasons we work, is to have more control of what we can do for our families and to feel that we have some sense of security in our day-to-day lives. When that security is threatened due to whatever circumstance (losing a job, a personal or financial setback) we feel anxious. We’ve all been there, and I’m sure many of us are there right now. Part of the legitimate role of government is to make sure that people have as much “agency” as possible.<br>Joe went on to talk about his experience with Waymo, the self-driving cab company.<br>         “Let me give you a concrete example. Some of my friends who were very talented were at Waymo and building these cars a lot of people have been in now, with no one driving around in them. And in one of their next companies a group of them are creating is one that is doing construction automation. They&#39;re taking things like Caterpillar machines and automating them to build roads. They could build foundations and buildings now, requiring a lot fewer people. And the naive response is, ‘Oh my goodness, there are not going to be construction jobs.’<br>         “No, no, no, no. When you could do these things much cheaper, it massively increases demand. If we can roll this out everywhere, they&#39;re going to have a lot more things being built and a lot more things being built economically, which means it&#39;s very, very good for economic activity. It&#39;s very disinflationary. It&#39;s very good for wealth creation, and there&#39;ll be so many more jobs created around that.”<br>I agree with Joe on this. Productivity is the golden key that unlocks economic growth. Particularly when population growth is slowing or even reversing, as is increasingly the case. Technology has always been the key to boosting productivity, going all the way back to the steam engine and cotton gin. AI is just the latest step in that process, which is now more about augmenting our brains than our muscles.<br>(By the way, I highly recommend that you subscribe to Joe’s fabulous podcast series, American Optimist). This week he talks with the man who is bringing flying cars and taxis to our lives. Always a must listen!<br>2/ Creative Destruction<br>--------------------<br>We all intuitively understand something called Schumpeter’s “creative destruction” principle. Automobiles decimated the horse carriage industry, including the people who took care of the horses, their drivers and all the things that went along with them. Automation took us from a time when 80% of the people were involved in agriculture to 2% today.<br>There were 235,000 telephone operators in 1930 and by 1940 AT&amp;T employed 350,000 telephone operators, 98% of which were women, mostly between the ages of 16 and 24, and not at the upper end of the wage scale. Today there are a few thousand jobs still classified as telephone operators, and I’m sure they’re not doing what was done in 1940.<br>As technology improved telecommunication, costs dropped precipitously even as services exploded. In 1984, I spent over $1,000 a month for telecommunications and getting a small fraction of the capacity I have the day in my hand for $100 a month.<br>Better telecommunication and the Internet created jobs even as certain jobs disappeared. That has been the case for every major technological advance. And almost every time a new technology comes along there are complaints jobs will lost. They fail to see the importance of creative destruction. That we need to, as Joe says, destroy jobs so that we can grow and have more jobs.<br>The answer to the question “Where will the jobs come from?” is “I don’t know, but they will!” That has always been the answer, and it has always been the correct answer. Yes, I know robots are going to eat jobs, but people will use those robots to create more jobs and businesses. That’s what a free market does. Bureaucrats (and Congressional committees) have a perverse incentive to grow their turf, which means more people and more regulations and more prestige for them. The role of government oversight is to rein in this bureaucratic overreach and to allow as free a market as is reasonably possible.<br>If we have an open environment that rewards creativity and hard work, we will have all the jobs we need. Especially if we create a fluid system where people can relocate to where the jobs are or creative new entrepreneurs that build businesses where the people are. That is what has always happened since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution and democratic free market society.<br>All that said, AI still has a long way to go. It is not yet clear which specific technologies will prove most useful. But with the planet’s best minds working hard on the problem, we have good reason to share Joe’s optimism.<br>3/ Human Steepener<br>---------------<br>One of those new faces I mentioned belonged to Marko Papic. I feel a little pride about this because Marko earned his current position at BCA Research when he met Martin Barnes at SIC years ago. He’s not just part of our event; he is a product of it.<br>Marko specializes in macro and geopolitical strategy for BCA. My partner Ed D’Agostino engaged him in a wide-ranging conversation on many topics, including the ongoing trade war. Marko believes we should avoid the guessing game of “What will Trump do next?” He says better to think about what is possible. Here’s Marko:<br>          “I think what the investors should start doing is not trying to figure out based on his speeches and his rhetoric what he wants, but rather based on a study of the constraints, what he can get. And what can the U.S. get from his counterparts? Well, not much.<br>          “First and foremost, the bond market has already spoken and it&#39;s not going to let the United States count tariff revenue as revenue for any sort of massive tax cuts. In fact, what&#39;s happening in the House and the Senate is quite extraordinary. The U.S. is going to have far less, far less fiscal thrust than it was expected because there was already a bond market riot at the end of last year, we had the Fed cut rates by 100 basis points. The bond market pretty much ignored it.<br>[[Hai đồ biểu của BCA Research]<br>Source: BCA Research<br>          “You can see on this chart something very important. With the Silicon Valley bank crisis in 2023, with a Sahm rule hysteria last summer, these were all recession triggers, and yet the bond market went down to three, three and a half. This time around with a much higher probability of a recession due to uncertainty, the bond market has not rallied.<br>          “This is a very, very bad signal for the Trump administration. It means that borrowing costs to the U.S. are not going to come down. This is the number one constraint to President Trump, the slowdown that he could effectively create due to a trade war.<br>         “There was [supposed to be] a silver lining for it; bond yields come down, he gets to pass even more new tax cuts. That&#39;s not happening, and it&#39;s not happening because the bond market does not believe the tariff revenue is genuine, and it&#39;s not. It&#39;s because of the Laffer curve, exactly like taxes. If I were to tax you at 100% of your income, guess what? You would stop working, and you wouldn&#39;t give me any tax revenue. Similarly, if you set tariffs too high, nobody can pay them, and then therefore there will be no imports, thus there will be no revenues. And the bond market is not stupid. In fact, it&#39;s very intelligent.<br>“So this is the constraint number one, the U.S. cannot set tariffs too high because the bond market will not count it as revenue. You can see the chart on the right.<br>[Hai đồ biểu của BCA Research]<br>Source: BCA Research<br>        “This is a way to basically measure term premium. President Trump has effectively been a human steepener. He has steepened the yield curve, he&#39;s increased borrowing costs. That&#39;s why the housing market is right now effectively collapsing. I mean, it was already in the doldrums, but no one&#39;s buying a home or selling it. And you can see that that continues to be much elevated, much higher than where yields should be given the recessionary risks. This is going to continue as long as the trade war continues and is ultimately the main constraint in President Trump. [Trump cóc biết?]<br>        “The second constraint, the dollar is the reserve currency. This allows the U.S. to run this deeply negative net international investment position. You can see that with a green line. It&#39;s effectively 100% of GDP.<br>[Đồ biểu của BCA Research]<br>Source: BCA Research<br>          “This means that foreigners own about $20 trillion more of U.S. assets than Americans own abroad, and yet somehow magically American net investment balance is still positive. You can see that that&#39;s the black line, which is difficult to see because it&#39;s close to zero, but nonetheless it&#39;s pretty impressive. Despite having this massive amount of liabilities, Americans are able to effectively make a net positive return on their assets.<br>          “There&#39;s only two ways to explain this chart. One is that all foreigners basically are children when it comes to investing, they just don&#39;t know how to invest. Or, more likely, foreigners are willing to keep very low yielding assets in the U.S. such as treasuries, and so that is the underpinning of the exorbitant privilege. This chart right here shows you what the reserve currency looks like. It allows the U.S. to have this very deep negative international investment position and yet to be perfectly fine with it. Of course, that can only work as long as foreigners are willing to buy American assets that yield very little, i.e., the treasuries.<br>          “And as you can see over the course of the last couple of weeks, American allies have actually told America that their holding of treasuries is open to negotiation. In other words, they may not continue to service America&#39;s debt. This was the Japanese finance minister, Katō, who said, ‘We obviously need to pull all cards on the table, and it (referring to Japan&#39;s holding of treasuries) is one of these cards.’<br>          “Now, I find this absolutely shocking. Now, this was kind of a paradigm shift. China has never said anything like this, ever. China has very gradually allowed many of its treasuries to mature and replace them with gold, but it has never actively warned the U.S. that it could sell its hoard of treasuries.<br>         “A lot of commentators are very glib about this. They say, ‘Well, this can never happen because the value of that treasury holding would collapse to any country that starts selling them.’ I disagree because the U.S. is at such a precarious fiscal position that even a small sell-off in treasuries will add to this term premium that is already very pernicious and causing the U.S. to spend way too much money financing its debt.<br>          “And so even a small sell-off, even a marginal, symbolic one actually matters for the U.S. And so yes, the rest of the world does have something in its hands. It has a very powerful card as President Trump likes to say, the rest of the world does hold a lot of cards.”<br>All presidents, even Trump, are prisoner to circumstances. Trump can adeptly play every card available to him but, as Marko describes, other countries have cards, too. The 90-day pause to reciprocal tariffs, which was supposed to allow time for negotiation, is more than halfway over. So far, it has produced only a limited deal with the UK and a partial agreement with China.<br>On the other hand, Trump is pretty good at manufacturing new cards when his hand isn’t working. Maybe more deals will come soon. I agree with David Bahnsen, who expects to see a number of very underwhelming trade deals in the next few months. Trump will declare victory and go home.<br>But personally, I wish he would turn his attention to solving our debt and entitlement spending problems.

Sở dĩ biết được là nhờ Nhượng Tống (1906-1949) viết về ông ta: đại trí thức đòi làm cách mạng văn hóa đời Minh mà vào tù, rồi tự sát trong tù. Sau đó đọc thêm một cuốn do Pauline C. Lee viết về Lý Trác Ngô (Li Zhi, Confusianism and The Virtue of Desire), nhờ đó lại như về nhà vì gặp Vương Dương Minh, người Lý Trác Ngô khâm phục và tìm đọc để học hỏi!<br>Cuốn sách nhắc đến nhà tư tưởng có ý cải cách đạo Khổng ra khỏi cõi mê đắm của Tống Nho là Vương Dương Minh (1472-1529), nhà bác học thấm nhuần tinh thần Phật giáo. Ngày xưa, tôi có đọc thấy đâu đó rằng đệ tử của nhân vật vĩ đại này qua Việt Nam thì sĩ phu của ta chỉ hỏi họ về phong thủy và để mả ở đâu cho con cháu khá ra. Họ nản chí bèn đi Nhật và phát huy tinh thần cải cách của Vương Dương Minh ở đó - cho nên ta thấy sự khác biệt! <br>Nhưng tại sao găp Vương Dương Minh lại… như về nhà?

Eighty-one years ago today, on June 6, 1944, Operation Overlord launched with the fury of 156,000 Allied troops slamming into Hitler’s Atlantic Wall across a 50-mile stretch of French coastline.<br>This wasn’t merely D-Day, it was Defiance Day. Code named Operation Neptune, the beach landings were part of the larger air-sea Operation Overlord, and began with a brutal aerial and naval bombardment, followed by airborne assaults and five simultaneous beach landings: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. The weather was marginal, the risk enormous, and the stakes total.<br>Every soldier who hit that surf knew that failure meant more than death; it meant the death of Europe. Under fire from machine guns, mortars, and artillery, they fought their way up mined beaches, through fortified towns, and into the history books. It cracked the German line and marked the beginning of the end for the Third Reich.<br>Fast-forward these 81 years, and war looks different but the stakes feel the same. The face of warfare is changing, and the revolution is coming from below, literally. Military drone technology, once a niche tool for reconnaissance and surgical strikes, has matured into the primary force-multiplier on the battlefield.<br>In Ukraine, in Russia, and increasingly around the world, the future of combat is being shaped not by fleets of tanks or battalions of infantry, but by cheap, fast, deadly flying machines built in workshops and basements. Generals and think-tanks are wondering aloud whether it is possible to hold ground with robotic systems and not just use them to deny territory.<br>********<br>Silicon, Sovereignty, and the Death of Empire: Ukraine’s Drone Revolution and the American Decider Doctrine<br>Ukraine and Russia are in a full-blown drone arms race. They aren’t waiting for defense contractors or formal acquisitions processes. They’re running on Scrum and garage ingenuity.<br>These are not model airplane hobbyists with GoPros duct-taped to their UAVs. This is industrialized tinkering at national scale.<br>Ukraine in particular is pioneering this wave with help from Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite constellation turned military backbone. Without Starlink, Ukraine would be blind. Period.<br>Russia’s satellite internet capabilities are weaker, slower, and more fragile. That one asymmetric advantage, Starlink broadband from orbit, may be the single most important logistical differentiator of the war.<br>Interestingly, the symbolic sidelining of Elon Musk by Donald Trump sent a broader message: business must not dictate national policy. This aligns with Ukraine’s own drive toward de-oligarchization. It was no accident that Trump, after downplaying Musk, pivoted to promoting the Ukraine Recovery Fund, emphasizing clean capital flows and private sector transparency in the reconstruction process.<br>Most of the Trump-Musk riff is probably noise amplified by the media, and Musk remains the most indispensable innovator in the world. Perhaps he just needs some downtime. Or rehab from the psychedelics he allegedly uses to boost his mind above and beyond genius level.<br>Meanwhile, Trump’s diplomatic choreography as seen by his speaking to Xi Jinping shortly after a call with Putin signaled something deeper: Russia is increasingly seen not as a sovereign peer but a global liability, a destabilizing variable to be jointly managed by actual great powers. That’s a seismic demotion for the Kremlin.<br>And Ukraine is not waiting. It proved its ability to strike preemptively and seize initiative this week by knocking out Iskander launchers, sabotaging Russian logistics, and even targeting the Black Sea Fleet with naval drones. More symbolically damaging, reports are emerging of Russian soldiers killing their own officers before surrendering.<br>This isn’t just anecdote, it’s structural rot. The Russian army has burned through the competent cadre it had before the war. What’s left is selfish, brutal leadership that uses conscripts as cannon fodder. Expect more fragging incidents. Ukrainian psychological operations are stoking them by offering rewards, video surrender instructions, promises of safe passage, and glorification of mutiny. There is one constant to war, and it is the effect of Psyops on the enemy mind.<br>And drone warfare isn’t just physical. It’s psychological. Sirens have returned to the battlefield but this time, they are not mounted to Stuka dive bombers, but on quadcopters. Drones are now being equipped with audio payloads to terrify, distract, or deprive sleep. There is no longer any “rear area” to hide in. A soldier resting under a tree can be spotted by an ISR drone and killed by a strike drone within minutes. There’s no silence. There’s no sanctuary.<br>And here lies a fundamental asymmetry in motivation. Russia, to this day, insists it is not at war with Ukraine. It is at war with Nazis as a useful euphemism that echoes their Cold War framing against Germany. In WWII, they say, they didn’t conquer Germany; they defeated Nazism. This allowed them to absorb East Germany ideologically. The same trick is being attempted today. Putin does not want to destroy Ukraine. He wants to possess it. That means shaping the narrative for postwar governance, not total annihilation. Today is day 1,199 of Putin’s “72-hour” war.<br>Ukraine has no such illusions. Their hatred is absolute. They do not see Russians as brothers or liberators. They see them as existential threats, and rightly so. This asymmetry creates a feedback loop of escalation: Russia tries to manage optics. Ukraine tries to survive. One side kills out of strategy. The other kills out of memory.<br>Putin has been in power for more than two decades. It takes thirty years or more to produce a competent NATO general as real officers are forged through study, field work, and discipline. In Russia, promotion runs through a different system entirely. Their military hierarchy resembles a mafia more than a meritocracy.<br>Advancement isn’t earned through competence, but through kickbacks and patronage. Sell a tank engine here, skim some antifreeze there, and soon you’ve got warheads that don’t detonate. Their war plan for Ukraine? Vintage 1982. They’re running Cold War doctrine against 21st-century threats.<br>All over the world, military planners have woken up to the drone and data link revolution. Russia is still trying to muscle through with steel and headcount. They’ve amassed another 60,000 troops on the front line. But they’re burning through a battalion a day or about 1,000 troops lost every 24 hours. That gives them a 60-day window of combat effectiveness with their newly mustered force, at best.<br>Russia is no longer capable of executing sweeping pincer movements. Instead, they’ve settled into a grind of 100 skirmishes per day across the front. Meanwhile, Ukrainian partisans are hammering their logistics and sowing chaos in the rear. Supply depots, command posts, and fuel trains are all targets for the drones now and nothing is safe.<br>Historically, we’ve seen the effects from degraded military leadership before. The U.S. military suffered over 800 documented fragging incidents in Vietnam when draftees were forced to fight under poor leadership. But after transitioning to an all-volunteer force in 1973, the military improved leadership standards, pay, and conditions. Since then, there have only been three documented fragging cases in 20 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br>The lesson is clear: when an armed force is under pressure and led by incompetent tyrants, it will self-correct violently. Russia has pushed over a million of its own men into this meat grinder under the banner of an imperial delusion. There is a breaking point. If 500 Russian battalions begin to see their officers fragged and their units surrender, the entire war effort could collapse overnight.<br>That collapse is already visible on the economic front. Russia’s federal reserves are down to $35 billion and dropping fast. In May alone, Moscow posted a $5.8 billion deficit. The West should strike now and hard. Increase sanctions. Target every last ruble. Choke the flow of tech, cash, and capital. Keep oil prices low. Go for the jugular and accelerate the collapse of this Potemkin economy. Like the late Soviet Union, Russia doesn’t need to hit zero for the system to implode. It just needs a good shove.<br>This is not just a war of weapons. It’s a war of systems. One side is improvising and executing faster than the other can plan. That difference is fatal. Ukraine is inside Russia’s OODA loop.<br>********<br>Drone Wars: When Swarms Meet Scrap: How Makeshift Countermeasures Expose Russian Rigidity and America’s Brutal Performance Edge<br>Countermeasures are emerging, but they’re just as makeshift as the drones themselves.<br>Interceptor drones are now flying as smaller, faster sky darts, often detonated by WWII era shell-proximity-fuzes and directed by onboard radar tech borrowed from civilian automotive sensors.<br>It seems the best tool to kill a drone is another drone. Interceptor drones burn battery like jet fuel and run hot. Like all drones, they run too hot to hide. They’re easily spotted on thermal, and yet are still effective.<br>On the ground, special rifle cartridges are being fielded in the form of plastic shot shells packed with anti-drone pellets and a tracer. Shotguns were tried, but rifles are better. Why? Because drones regularly carry multiple-pound warheads. You want to detonate them away from your trench, not right above it.<br>Lasers offer promise, but the field data now suggests only in dry conditions. They fire as long as power holds, and they can melt plastic rotors with precision. But Ukraine isn’t a desert. It’s damp. Fog, mist, rain, and humidity all reduce laser effectiveness to marginal levels after a few hundred meters. Nets used to work. Now, drone strike packages include a net-killer drone whose sole job is to blow a hole in the defense, so the next wave can come through.<br>Russia is suffering the most here because their doctrine is rigid. Their war games that are intended to test doctrine are theatrical. They always win. Like North Korea, Russians script the outcome and then pat themselves on the back. Their weapons aren’t tested in failure conditions. They’re tested in parades.<br>In contrast, U.S. military development, for all its bureaucracy ad slow speed, is rooted in adversarial testing. Red teaming. AB trials. The system is designed to find failure and iterate. Russian designs often are tried in third world conflicts and then the design is frozen for mass production for decades. Designs are locked in place to avoid possible embarrassment or worse. Innovation becomes risk. Risk becomes disloyalty.<br>And drone warfare is nothing if not a constant engine of risk and innovation.<br>This leaves Russia dangerously exposed. Not because they lack talent or factories, but because their system punishes failure more than it rewards adaptation. The Ukrainians iterate by the hour. The Russians are still signing off on CAD drawings. In the end, this is what will decide the war: not just whose drones fly farther, but whose ideas move faster.<br>********<br>Spiderweb Strike: Ukraine’s Trojan Drone Blitz and the Death of Russian Strategic Depth<br>Which brings us to Operation Spiderweb, a black swan moment for Russian air power. In a stunning display of reach and coordination, Ukraine used long-range drones to strike at the heart of Russia’s strategic aviation capability.<br>The attacks destroyed or damaged more than forty strategic bombers and took out two of the country’s five airborne radar control aircraft.<br>It wasn’t without warning. Back in 2023, Ukraine’s drone swarms had already struck the Peskov airfield in northwest Russia, annihilating a number of heavy transport aircraft. That wasn’t just a lucky shot as much as it was a signal: Ukraine had agents inside the perimeter. The border or fence was no longer a boundary.<br>Then came Engels-1 and Engels-2. Russia’s two crown-jewel strategic bomber bases. Ukraine reached out and hit them both last year. The result? Russia was forced to disperse its bombers to secondary airfields and locations that lacked proper infrastructure and hardened hangars.<br>Treaty obligations under arms control agreements require that strategic bombers remain visible for satellite monitoring. That’s a vulnerability in peacetime. In wartime, it’s a curse. With no hardened shelters at the secondary airfields, and up to 20% of Russia’s bomber fleet, those planes known as hangar queens for always awaiting parts or maintenance, sitting in the few non-hardened hangers available, the Russian Strategic Bomber Force was left exposed. What followed was inevitable.<br>Ukraine didn’t just strike planes. They struck doctrine. They struck confidence. And in doing so, they reminded the world: in drone warfare, everything is visible, everything is vulnerable, and everything can burn.<br>But the true brilliance of Operation Spiderweb wasn’t just in the strikes; it was in the setup. Over a year in advance, Ukraine quietly inserted itself into the Russian logistics system. Using a front company disguised as an intermodal freight operator, they shipped containers by truck and rail deep into Russian territory.<br>Inside some of these containers were drone motherships or custom-built launch platforms designed to remain dormant until the moment came. When the strikes began, these container motherships unleashed swarms of drones from inside Russia’s own logistical infrastructure.<br>It was the most effective surprise attack on Russian soil since June 21, 1941: Operation Barbarossa. And this time, the blitz wasn’t German tanks. It was Ukrainian technology, operating behind Russian lines, using Russia’s own systems against it. That’s not just battlefield innovation. That’s strategic infiltration at scale.<br>Now, Russia is forced to react with industrial-scale paranoia. The government has diverted significant forces to implement 100% inspection of trucks and containers across the country. Every box is suspect. Every shipment is a potential Trojan horse.<br>The Ukrainian containers weren’t just holding drones. They held self-contained satellite uplinks, battery charging systems, and wire-guided relay drones that maintained signal fidelity all the way back to FPV strike units. These fiber-linked drones routed communications below the noise floor of Russian jammers, rendering traditional electronic warfare obsolete.<br>Welcome to the new battlefield. It hums. It buzzes. It sees in the dark. And it has a license to kill.<br>********<br>Kill Chain Collapse: Putin’s Drone War Meltdown and the Rise of Ukraine’s Undersea Arsenal<br>And now, Vladimir Putin has a KGB man’s problem. In the wake of Operation Spiderweb, he must decide who takes the fall. The FSB? The military? Neither is safe.<br>Many of the senior officers from the targeted bases were in Moscow that weekend, sobering up from May Day festivities on a lazy spring Sunday morning.<br>Someone will pay. A witch hunt is coming.<br>Russia is hitting back hard with its heaviest assets, such as MIRVed Orelikon missiles. Already, as this is being written, Ukraine is enduring a massive bombardment of 410 missiles with more surely inbound. But this, too, reveals the strategic imbalance. Russia is spending hundreds of millions to retaliate against thousand-dollar assets. From an economic warfare standpoint, Russia is bleeding cash to keep up.<br>The Kerch Strait Bridge reopened yesterday, June 5th, after suffering two coordinated attacks the previous Sunday. The first strike was a detonation of one metric ton of TNT placed by combat divers and delivered by an underwater cargo drone, buried under the silt at the base of a pier supporting the ship channel’s elevated section.<br>The second strike, another metric ton of explosives, was delivered by an unmanned submersible drone that traveled hundreds of miles beneath the Black Sea from Ukrainian-controlled waters. These attacks demonstrated not only reach but precision.<br>And yet Ukraine has more in its arsenal. Intelligence suggests the existence of a new unmanned undersea drone platform over 130 feet long, capable of delivering 11,000 pounds of TNT, or roughly half the explosive power of a U.S. MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast). This monster drone has not yet seen combat. But if and when it does, the results will likely redefine naval sabotage as we know it.<br>********<br>Drone Hellfire: How Cheap Killers Are Shredding Legacy Armies and Redefining Modern War<br>Drones are altering the battlefield in three fundamental ways:<br>First, they separate the human operator from the battlefield by, in the case of Operation Spiderweb, thousands of miles. A pilot no longer needs to be anywhere near the front to launch a precise attack.<br>Second, drones turn the battlespace into a true three-dimensional zone. Unlike aircraft that pass overhead, drones can loiter. They can hover, wait, reposition, and strike when targets are vulnerable.<br>The battlefield is no longer a line; it’s a volume, and that volume is being mapped and exploited in real-time.<br>Third, drones can strike deep into the enemy’s rear and hit the supply lines, command nodes, fuel depots, and even airfields. This reach changes everything.<br>Attacking the rear doesn’t just destroy matériel. It collapses the time horizon for the front. In traditional warfare, a beleaguered front-line unit could hold out, knowing reinforcements or resupply might arrive in hours or days. Drones annihilate that margin. If the rear is compromised, and if the trucks, trains, or fuel convoys never make it then the front can’t afford to wait. It must fall back, surrender, or be destroyed.<br>This dynamic rewrites doctrine. It compresses operational tempo and forces real-time adaptation. There is no safe zone.<br>Ukrainians have turned drones into smart munitions, relay nodes, surveillance assets, and even psychological weapons. They drop anti-tank mines from the air with pinpoint accuracy. They run kamikaze-style FPV (First Person View) drones guided by operators hundreds of miles away.<br>The operators themselves are rarely soldiers. They’re gamers. Civilian contractor nerds with adrenaline and joysticks, not rifles. A forward deployed combat-tech team plugs in the fiber communications line or positions the drone, and the remote pilot executes the strike like he’s playing Call of Duty. It works.<br>Right now, humans are still in the loop. AI drones are on the lab bench, especially in the West, with NVIDIA silicon powering neural networks that can recognize and strike targets autonomously. But no one’s fielding these at scale. Yet.<br>Instead, the true revolution is logistical and economic. It’s not about replacing soldiers with robots. It’s about using $500 drones to destroy $5 million systems. That’s economic warfare. That’s precision as a trajectory from WWII carpet bombing prior to the Normandy invasion, to GPS-guided JDAMs, to drones flying into the weak point of a tank’s armor. This is war by decimal point.<br>********<br>Decentralized Death from the Sky: How Ukraine’s Disposable Drone Swarms and Chinese Cheap Shots Are Outgunning the Dinosaur West<br>The U.S. and its allies still dominate the high end. Western drones excel at long-duration ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) and force-multiplier roles like aerial refueling.<br>These platforms are exquisite, high-altitude, and high-cost. They are great for spotting trouble from orbit or feeding targeting data to long-range missiles. But they are not mass-producible. They are not disposable.<br>At this time, Ukraine far outpaces the USA and NATO in disposable, under 1,000 ft flying altitude suicide drones.<br>The centralized US defense industry is a dinosaur relative to the Ukrainian dispersed industry, and is another example of the arc of history bending in the direction of decentralization in the age of microchips.<br>Meanwhile, China has entered the chat. Chinese drones tend to be cheap and numerous, though less rugged. When they work, they work well enough. The difference is cost: one twentieth to one hundredth of the price of Western designs.<br>While Chinese microchips can’t compete with NVIDIA on raw horsepower, in a swarm environment quantity becomes its own kind of quality. It’s not the best chip that wins. It’s the one you can afford to lose by the thousands.<br>Chinese farmland purchases adjacent to American military bases certainly raise alarms as farm have barns, and barns can hide drone swarms preparing for an attack.<br>The casualty math is evolving too. Early in this war, most deaths were caused by artillery and shrapnel. Now, it’s drones. Reports suggest that up to 70% of casualties are now drone-related. The designs are still toy-like, made from carbon fiber, foam, and salvaged electronics. But the trend is toward harder, tougher platforms. Machines that can take a drop, get wet, get cold, and still kill.<br>Jamming was once an effective defense. It’s less so now. Fiber optic drones, which use physical cables instead of radio signals, are immune to jamming. These drones slither through trenches and around buildings, hugging the earth, staying under radar and electronic warfare umbrellas. They act as signal relays, internet node routers, and attack platforms in one. When they go quiet, you don’t know if they’re waiting or dead.<br>Which brings us to sleeper drones as the booby traps of the 21st century. These drones fly out, land, or pretend to crash. Then they wait. On fiber, with no RF emissions, they can stay alive for days. When a vehicle or soldier walks past, they activate. Some detonate. Others take off and pursue like a hunter.<br>This replaces static minefields with mobile, reprogrammable, repositioning death traps. Entire instant-on, instant-off, dynamic minefields can now fly in based on battlefield conditions. It’s tactical intelligence mixed with mobility.<br>Speed now beats armor. The foot soldier’s best defense is to move fast and stay small. That’s why we’re seeing the return of motorcycle assault teams. Light, mobile, hard to hit, perfect for placing relay drones or sleeper munitions before disappearing into the tree line. Every drone strike package is now a combined arms operation: sensor, shooter, relay, and decoy all in one.<br>Naval drones have joined the fray too, and they are devastating. Ukraine has used Starlink-guided naval drones both on the surface and subsurface to attack Russian Black Sea assets with shocking success. These drones require constant uplink and low latency. Without Starlink, they would be blind and deaf. With it, they are guided torpedoes with a brain.<br>The problem of latency is not exclusive to warfare. Just yesterday, Japan’s private lunar exploration company experienced its second crash landing on the Moon. The unmanned lunar lander failed due to signal latency. This is the delay between sending commands from Earth and receiving feedback from space. This is the second time a laser rangefinder system failed due to this delay, highlighting a vulnerability that also exists in long-range drone warfare.<br>********<br>Autonomy and Freedom: How AI-Driven Drones and a Supreme Court Bulwark Secure America’s Arsenal and Liberty Against Globalist Assault<br>When drones or spacecraft operate too far from controllers, or suffer from signal degradation, they become dangerously unreliable.<br>The solution? Greater automation. The next generation of drones and spacecraft will require onboard autonomy and real-time decision-making.<br>That’s why advancements in computer chips, especially those capable of running AI models efficiently, are now mission-critical.<br>Meanwhile, today the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously struck down Mexico’s claim that American gun manufacturers were responsible for cartel violence. This case, long in the making, originated during the Obama administration’s covert weapons trafficking programs as an attempt to flood Mexican cartels with U.S. firearms in hopes of creating chaos that would justify international firearms restrictions.<br>The end goal? Global momentum for banning the U.S. Bill of Rights. Had it succeeded, similar legal theories could have outlawed U.S. drone manufacturing on grounds of “dual use.”<br>This ruling secures not only American rights, but the ability to produce and export dual-use drone technologies.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R48" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">49</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/6/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">GIÁO CHỦ CỦ BỰA: ĐÃ DỐT LẠI CÒN GIAN!<br>Đấy cũng là một nguyên do vì sao Elon Musk lên tiếng và gây bất hòa với đám gia nô của Trump, đầu tiên là Peter Navarro...<br>https://www.nysun.com/.../the-china-shock-myth-unravels...<br>Columnists<br>The ‘China Shock’ Myth Unravels, Undermining Rationale for Trump’s Protectionist Tariffs<br>We are learning just how shaky the theory’s foundations are.<br>AP/Ng Han Guan<br>Shipping containers at the Guangzhou Port in China. AP/Ng Han Guan<br>VERONIQUE de RUGY<br>(By VERONIQUE de RUGY - NY Sun - Jun. 6, 2025) <br>When President Trump first campaigned in 2015, he capitalized on a potent narrative: that Communist China’s rise gutted American manufacturing, leaving countless blue-collar communities devastated. <br>Known now as the “China shock,” that idea paved the way for a dramatic resurgence in protectionism, culminating in sweeping tariffs including Mr. Trump’s controversial “Liberation Day” duties. Yet we are learning just how shaky the theory’s foundations are.<br>Pioneered by economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson, it suggests that American regions heavily exposed to Chinese imports suffered significantly greater job losses than did less-exposed areas. <br>Populists seized upon it to argue that China’s 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization caused millions of job losses in America and social disintegration.<br>Yet a theory’s easy and outsized application to policy does not settle questions about its accuracy. That’s what an American Enterprise Institute scholar, Scott Winship, aimed to determine in a recent comprehensive review that set out to prove whether the China shock reduced American manufacturing employment.<br>By examining alternative studies and methodological adjustments, Mr. Winship contends that the negative effects of trade with China have been significantly exaggerated, and that populist narratives blaming this trade for America economic decline aren’t supported by rigorous evidence.<br>The originators of the China shock theory examined how Chinese imports affected certain American locales compared with others -  not with the entire country - based on initial industry composition and employment size. <br>By these metrics, areas heavily exposed to Chinese imports showed disproportionately worse manufacturing job losses.<br>However, Mr. Winship points out that even if we accept these estimates, the findings suggest only relatively modest employment effects.<br>To put things in perspective, Mr. Winship gives the example of two hypothetical commuting zones with 200,000 working-age residents and 20,000 manufacturing employees. <br>Data from the theory’s proponents indicate that moving to high (90th percentile) exposure from low (10th percentile) exposure to Chinese imports would result in a loss of roughly 2,700 manufacturing jobs - just a 1.4-percentage-point drop in overall manufacturing employment.<br>While significant, this does not convincingly explain the community decline, social disruption, and populist backlash often blamed specifically on Chinese trade.<br>In addition, Mr. Winship flags multiple methodological issues. Once other economists revised the proponents’ methods, the estimated negative impact shrank dramatically. <br>Various followup studies found the China shock effect on manufacturing employment to be 50 percent smaller than initially claimed.<br>Further research found that job losses in exposed areas were often offset or even outweighed by employment gains in other sectors. <br>One detailed Census Bureau study even found that firms with greater Chinese import exposure increased manufacturing employment, reallocating jobs to more efficient domestic production lines enabled by cheaper imports.<br>Moreover, the steady decline in American manufacturing employment began decades before China’s WTO entry. Between the late 1970s and 2000, factory employment had already decreased substantially, mostly because of technological advances and shifting consumer demand.<br>Notably, there was no sudden acceleration of this decline after China joined the WTO. The rate of manufacturing job losses remained consistent with earlier trends, undermining claims that Chinese trade uniquely devastated American manufacturing.<br>Furthermore, former manufacturing employees generally did not face permanent unemployment. In fact, unemployment rates among this group were lower in recent years compared to the late 1990s, before the peak of Chinese imports. <br>Many transitioned successfully into other sectors, belying the notion of an enduring displacement crisis. It’s also worth noting that there are around half a million unfilled manufacturing jobs today.<br>Despite these realities, the exaggerated narrative persists as a political force. Mr. Trump’s tariffs - taxes on American consumers raising prices on everyday goods from cars to clothing - have greatly increased economic uncertainty. <br>American manufacturers reliant on imported components face higher input costs, dampening their competitiveness and causing unintended layoffs.<br>Evidence from Mr. Trump’s first term showed that his tariffs often hurt American firms more than their foreign competitors. With broader and higher tariffs, we can only fear the worst.<br>Instead of doubling down on tariffs and isolation, we need to empower working Americans to adapt to economic changes, whether caused by trade or economic downturn. <br>Economists have shown that to the extent that working Americans sometimes don’t recover from shocks, it tends to be a failure to adjust because of obstacles erected by government.<br>Mr. Winship’s critical reassessment of the China shock clarifies the actual, limited role Chinese imports have played in manufacturing-employment trends. <br>The real “shock” America faces in 2025 is not from Chinese imports but from a resurgence of misguided protectionism based on a misdiagnosed problem. The path forward harnesses trade’s real benefits rather than chasing economic illusions.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R49" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">50</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/6/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TƯỜNG THUẬT CỦA THE FREE PRESS VỀ MÂU THUẪN MUSK – TRUMP:<br>https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-and-musk-are-getting-divorced<br>Trump and Musk Are Getting Divorced. What Happens to the Kids?<br>(Illustration by The Free Press.

Though almost everyone was surprised how the once buddy-buddy relationship between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk blew up on Thursday.<br>At the start of the week, Musk was politely voicing his differences of opinion over policy. Four days later, he was alleging on his X platform that the president is “in the Epstein files” and endorsing calls for Trump’s impeachment. Now, three senior White House officials tell The Free Press Trump is even contemplating selling the bright-red Tesla that he purchased earlier this year. “He’s thinking about it, yes,” one of them said.<br>“Vibe shift” is how another senior White House official summed up the Trump-Musk blowup to The Free Press. A prominent venture capital executive said the rift is “so predictable it hurts.”<br>Perhaps. But the feud between Musk and the president for whom he spent over $250 million to help elect is about more than just a bromance turned sour. If Musk and Trump are getting a divorce, the tech right - a burgeoning and influential group of MAGA-friendly Silicon Valley figures - are the kids who now need to pick a side.<br>The immediate cause of the breakup was the centerpiece of Trump’s legislative agenda: the One Big Beautiful Bill - which passed the House last month by a single vote and has until July 4 to make it through the Senate - quickly became personal. On Wednesday, Musk had said the bill amounted to “debt slavery for the American people” after Trump, in a Monday post on his site Truth Social, called the bill “a Historic Opportunity to turn our Country around after four disastrous years under Joe Biden.”<br>Musk amped it up a notch Thursday around noon: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” he posted on X, adding, “Such ingratitude.”<br>At 2:37 p.m., Trump posted: “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!”<br>Trump then suggested terminating “Governmental Subsidies and Contracts” for Musk’s companies, which include Tesla and SpaceX.<br>“Such an obvious lie. So sad,” Musk retorted 11 minutes later. By then, Tesla stock had already begun to plummet.<br>That’s when Musk went for the jugular.<br>“Time to drop the really big bomb,” he wrote on X at 3:10 p.m. “@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.”<br>“Have a nice day, DJT!” he added.<br>As of Friday morning, the post had more than 160 million views. Musk also shared a post on X by a right-wing influencer that called for Trump to be impeached, with the world’s richest man adding, “Yes.”<br>The dramatic falling-out put figures at the heart of the tech-MAGA alliance in an awkward position. Hence why some of the most prominent pro-Trump tech figures have stayed quiet since things blew up. Others have tried their best to avoid taking sides.<br>“The biggest winner today is China,” Shaun Maguire, a partner at the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, posted on X Thursday afternoon. David Friedberg, an investor and a co-host of the All-In Podcast, said the same.<br>Others weren’t so shy.<br>“FUCK THIS SLOB,” wrote investor Jason Calacanis, another All-In co-host. The podcast, which is also hosted by David Sacks, Trump’s crypto czar, has emerged as a major influencer on the tech right, and its hosts even interviewed Trump in the summer before the 2024 election.<br>Calacanis’s post was directed at none other than longtime Trump ally and War Room host Steve Bannon, who amid the conflict had called on Trump to nationalize Musk’s company SpaceX. On Thursday, Bannon went so far as to allege to The New York Times that he was “of the strong belief” Musk “is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately.”<br>Musk “is right to stand up to Trump and the GOP for caving on spending,” said Mark Pincus, the founder of the game developer Zynga and co-founder of the Bay Area’s Reinvent Capital.<br>And then there’s Vice President J.D. Vance, who has close ties to tech investors like Peter Thiel and David Sacks and personifies the tech-MAGA alliance more than any other politician. Unsurprisingly, he took his boss’s side. Trump “has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads,” Vance said in a post on X Thursday, stating that he is “proud to stand beside him.”<br>In another post, Vance made light of the drama, posting a photo of himself with popular podcaster Theo Von with the caption “Slow news day, what are we even going to talk about?”<br>The dramatic rift may explain why Musk’s cost-cutting DOGE effort faced roadblocks within the federal government and never realized its full potential, according to one former DOGE employee.<br>“I think DOGE was predicated on this idea that there was a lot of alignment between Elon and Trump,” Sahil Lavingia, the former DOGE employee and CEO of an e-commerce platform called Gumroad, told The Free Press.<br>Lavingia, who was fired from DOGE in May, called the DOGE initiative “a political football” used as the “scapegoat for Trump to get his way.” “It was hard to explain why DOGE was not as successful as I or others expected it to be, but maybe now it’s more obvious: Trump never really wanted DOGE to succeed in the $1 trillion-debt-savings sort of way,” Lavingia said.<br>But the falling-out over DOGE and the Big Beautiful Bill has spilled over into other areas. After Musk announced he was departing DOGE, Trump pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. Isaacman, a Musk ally, suggested Wednesday that it was because of his relationship to the ex-DOGE chief. Two people familiar with the matter told The Free Press that Sergio Gor, the director of the White House’s Presidential Personnel Office, had clashed with Musk about Isaacman - who previously gave more than $300,000 in political donations to Democrats. The giving was a point of consternation for some Republicans.<br>For some on the MAGA side of the divorce, Thursday’s drama demonstrated both Musk’s political inexperience and the kind of behavior that caused conservatives to grow weary of his role in government.<br>“Musk’s eruption on X is unhelpful for the constitutional cause and the country,” Ryan Williams, president of the Claremont Institute, told The Free Press. “One can understand his frustration with the messiness of a razor-thin majority from a Congress that hasn’t had to appropriate seriously in over three decades.”<br>Williams added, “Welcome to politics and the party, man!”<br>Jenna Ellis, a former attorney for Trump who recently went through her own public divorce from MAGA, called the breakdown between Musk and Trump inevitable. “Like every relationship in Trump World, it was entirely transactional from the beginning,” she told The Free Press.<br>But “the real question,” Ellis said, “is what this means for J.D. Vance and the future of the GOP.” Vance was picked to solidify the alliance between the tech right and MAGA, she said, so now that there is a public breakdown, it leads to the question: “Which side is Vance on?”<br>“He probably can’t play both sides, which means whoever eventually comes out on top and in control of the GOP come 2028, it may very well be an open primary with neither Trump nor Thiel backing Vance,” Ellis said.<br>In other words, will the Trump-Musk divorce open the door for potential future MAGA challengers to step up to the plate in 2028 and earn the billionaire’s favor? Just as the drama unfolded Thursday, the political action committee of Florida governor Ron DeSantis launched a fundraising campaign praising Musk’s work for DOGE. (A spokesperson for the PAC told Politico the timing was a mere coincidence).<br>By last night, though, the heated exchanges between Trump and Musk began to cool, making it seem like perhaps Vance won’t have to pick a side after all.<br>“I support @RealDonaldTrump and @ElonMusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country,” hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump before the 2024 election, posted on X at 5:30 p.m.<br>“You’re not wrong,” Musk responded.<br>Late Thursday night, Trump signaled in a phone call with Politico that he might be willing to make amends after all.<br>“Oh, it’s okay,” Trump said about the online meltdown. “It’s going very well, never done better.”<br>Still, by Friday morning, Trump went back to telling reporters that Musk “has lost his mind.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R50" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">51</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/6/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">CÁCH MẠNG ĂN THỊT CON!<br>Sinh tại Liên Xô năm 1957, Peter Turchin trở thành một nhà khoa học lưu vong tại Hoa Kỳ với trường phái Cliodynamica nghiên cứu về sự vận hành của lịch sử trong thế động (Clio là nữ thần Lịch Sử theo thần thoại Hy Lạp). <br>Peter Turchin được các học giả chú ý vì phương pháp nghiên cứu độc đáo.

We don’t know how it will end, and what its long-term consequences will be.<br>For example, an NYT analysis today points out :<br>&gt; Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump did not have a feud five days ago and might not have a feud five days from now. Until proven otherwise, all of this is theater. Think of it as the political version of professional wrestling. For a few hours, everyone was diverted by the spectacle of a brawl between the world’s richest man and its most powerful person.<br>Thus, this storm may blow over or result in a lasting split between the two most powerful leaders in the MAGA coalition. Whatever the outcome, it’s still worth discussing, because it’s a surface reflection of deep currents. More than half a year ago, in a Guardian opinion, The deep historical forces that explain Trump’s win (Nov. 30, 2024), I wrote:<br>&gt; What’s next? The electoral defeat of the party of the American ruling class on November 5 is just another battle in the on-going revolutionary war. The triumphant counter-elites aim for a wholesale replacement of the ruling elites, or the deep state, as they would have it. But history shows that success in achieving such goals is far from being assured. The ruling elites are well entrenched in the bureaucracy to resist change. Ideological and personal tensions within the winning coalition may result in it breaking apart (as often happened in past revolutions - as they say, revolutions devour their own children).<br>Francisco Goya, Saturn devouring his son (1820–23)<br>This phrase, that revolutions devour their children, is sometimes attributed to Danton during the 1794 trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal, in which he was condemned to the guillotine. In fact, it was coined by Jacques Mallet du Pan a year earlier: “A l&#39;exemple de Saturne, la révolution dévore ses enfants” (like Saturn, the Revolution devours its children). But Danton certainly had a good cause to say it, as did later Zinoviev, Kamenev, and other Old Bolsheviks during the Moscow Show Trials of 1936–38.<br>The logic underlying such developments is easy to understand. Typically, a successful revolution is accomplished by a coalition of diverse counter-elites, who cooperate to overthrow the previous ruling regime. But once they come to power, ideological and personal tensions come to the fore. Further, the problem of elite overproduction still looms tall and must be dealt with, by either exterminating surplus elites or forcing them into downward social mobility. This is the fate of factions that suffer defeat in intra-elite conflicts that typify the early years of a revolution.<br>Whatever happens next and whichever factions emerge victorious in our revolution, we are virtually guaranteed years of continuing social turbulence and political conflict. This is especially true because the root causes that brought us into the current predicament - immiseration, elite overproduction, and state weakness - haven’t yet been addressed. On the contrary, they only continue gaining strength.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R51" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">52</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/6/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES NGÀY HÔM NAY 2025/6/6:<br>Tariffs and Distrust Hit Critical Minerals<br>by Geopolitical Futures - June 6, 2025<br>Base metals, battery metals and rare earth elements play major roles in the production of industrial  and consumer goods used daily.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote one, ending an unfair legal bar to lawsuits alleging so-called reverse discrimination. Justice Sonia Sotomayor had the other one, saying Wisconsin was wrong to deny a tax exemption to a Catholic Charities nonprofit.<br>That first outcome isn’t a surprise, given the tone at oral arguments. Marlean Ames claims that while working under a gay boss, she was passed over for less-qualified gay competitors. Her employer, the state of Ohio, denies wrongdoing. But the lower courts threw out the case essentially because Ms. Ames, who is straight, is a member of a majority group.<br>The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that, under its legal test, Ms. Ames needed to substantiate “the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.” Yes, a higher legal standard that applies in only some discrimination cases, based on the plaintiff’s race or sex.<br>Justice Jackson’s opinion in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services cites the text of the 1964 Civil Rights Act: “By establishing the same protections for every ‘individual’ - without regard to that individual’s membership in a minority or majority group - Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone.”<br>Justice Clarence Thomas goes further in a concurrence, co-signed by Justice Neil Gorsuch. The Sixth Circuit’s test is “plainly at odds with the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection,” he writes. Also, how are judges even supposed to define who’s in a “majority” group? “Black employees in Detroit, for example, make up a majority in their city,” he says. Men are a minority of the U.S. but a majority of construction workers.<br>The unanimity in the other case is even more notable. Under Wisconsin law, if a nonprofit is controlled by a church and run “primarily for religious purposes,” it isn’t required to pay into the state’s unemployment fund. According to the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s 4-3 liberal majority, that exemption doesn’t cover a local bishop’s Catholic Charities arm and its associated entities, whose good works include services for the disabled.<br>“Their activities are secular in nature,” the state court held. Their charity is open to all, and they don’t “attempt to imbue program participants with the Catholic faith.” But Justice Sotomayor writes in Catholic Charities Bureau v. Wisconsin that this application of state law violates the First Amendment, as a “paradigmatic form of denominational discrimination.”<br>The Catholic nonprofits said they were following religious teachings, including warnings not to misuse charity to proselytize. “Much like a law exempting only those religious organizations that perform baptisms or worship on Sundays,” Justice Sotomayor says, “an exemption that requires proselytization or exclusive service of co-religionists establishes a preference for certain religions based on the commands of their religious doctrine.”<br>Justice Thomas offers a concurrence suggesting the Wisconsin court was also wrong in treating Catholic Charities as separate from the church, simply based on corporate structure.<br>If the rulings sound like a big surprise given the invective aimed at the Supreme Court these days, note that in last year’s term 45.8% of cases were unanimous.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R53" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">54</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/6/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">THÊM MỘT BƯỚC TIẾN… ĐỂ ĐẨY LUI ‘DEI’<br>Chủ trương DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) của cánh tả dẫn đến hậu quả trái ngược là bất công cho dân da trắng, những ai có đời sống tình dục bình thường (thay vì đồng tính), v.v.

Supreme Court Unanimously Rejects Added Burden for Whites in Discrimination Lawsuits<br>(Jonathan Turley - Constitutional Law, Courts, Supreme Court June 6, 2025) <br>Yesterday, the Supreme Court handed down three major cases with unanimous decisions. One, Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, raises additional questions over diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that have been widely used in higher education and businesses. There is no reason to believe that DEI measures are DOA, but the decision is likely to accelerate challenges based on reverse discrimination after the Court rejected the imposition of an added burden for members of any “majority group” including straight, white males.<br>The immediate question before the Court was a circuit split over the standard that applies to a member of a “majority” group who claims that he or she was treated unfairly based on majority characteristics. The Sixth Circuit, along with four other circuits, held that such litigants must shoulder additional pleading burdens under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.<br>Many of us have long argued that this long-standing rule was itself discriminatory and at odds with both constitutional and statutory authority. It was a bizarre interpretation of a law that barred employees from discriminating based on “race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.”  That would ordinarily require a plaintiff to support a claim of disparate treatment by showing that she applied for a position for which she was qualified but was rejected under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. However, judges began to add their own burden of white, male or straight litigants in requiring them to show additional “background circumstances” that show the defendant is an “unusual employer” that discriminates against majority groups.<br>In this case, Marlean Ames, a heterosexual woman, claimed that she was demoted at the Ohio Department of Youth Services after Ginine Trim, a gay woman, replaced her supervisor. Trim hired a younger gay man allegedly based on sexual orientation. Both the district court and the Sixth Circuit dismissed the complaint because Ames failed to identify any other “background circumstances” that demonstrated her employer discriminated against heterosexual women.<br>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote for a unanimous Supreme Court that reversed the Sixth Circuit and rejected the “additional circumstances” test as at odds with the plain text of Title VII.<br>    “As a textual matter, Title VII’s disparate-treatment provision draws no distinctions between majority-group plaintiffs and minority-group plaintiffs. Rather, the provision makes it unlawful “to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” The “law’s focus on individuals rather than groups [is] anything but academic.” Bostock v. Clayton County (2020). By establishing the same protections for every “individual”—without regard to that individual’s membership in a minority or majority group—Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone.”<br>Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Gorsuch, filed a concurrence that chastised lower courts and “judges creating atextual legal rules and frameworks.”<br>The opinion has broader implications for businesses and higher education where DEI has been used to brush aside such reverse discrimination claims. Often such claims are mocked as suggesting that members of a majority group are “victims.” While not imposing this specific “add-on,” these controversies involve much of the same bias against reverse discrimination claims. Litigants complain that they often face greater demand and resistance to their claims as opposed to employees who are part of minority groups.<br>Various legal groups insisted that the Sixth Circuit was correct and that majority-group litigants should shoulder an added burden, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, National Women’s Law Center, Latino Justice, National Employment Law Project and Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.  The views of these groups could not garner a single vote on the Court.<br>The Ames decision is a welcome development in bringing greater uniformity in the treatment of discrimination claims. It is also a shot across the bow of businesses and universities that have used DEI to dismiss the countervailing interests and claims of majority-group employees.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R54" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">55</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/6/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TÌNH HÌNH NHÂN DỤNG HOA KỲ VÀO THÁNG NĂM:<br>Mỗi Thứ Sáu đầu tiên trong tháng, cục Thống Kê bộ Lao Động lại công bố tình hình nhân dụng (sử dụng nhân lực) của tháng trước.

Join the discussion in our Over My Shoulder community space.<br>-Patrick Watson<br>____<br>(b) June 6, 2025 by Peter Boockvar: Jobs Friction Growing <br>Payrolls in May rose a net 139k, 13k above expectations but the two prior months were revised lower by a combined 95k. There was a large decline of 696k jobs in the household survey but this data point really jumps around as it follows a gain of 461k in April, 201k in March and a drop of 588k in February. As this though matched the 625k person decline in the labor force, the unemployment rate held at 4.2% for a 3rd straight month. <br>Helping to explain the big drop in the labor force was this, the participation rate fell to 62.4% from 62.6% and that matches the lowest since December 2022. The participation rate for the key 25-54 yr old age cohort also fell two tenths m/o/m to 83.4% but after rising by .3% last month. Also, there was a big drop in the ‘job <br>leavers’ category which is essentially a quits rate number and it measures leavers as a % of the unemployed. This fell to 9.8% from 11.8% and that’s the least since May 2021. <br>Private education/health continues to be the main driver of job growth, contributing 87k jobs and more than half of the 145k service sector jobs added. Leisure and hospitality added 48k so these two groups contributed to most of the service sector gains. Little job growth was seen elsewhere. Temp jobs of 20k were lost and they were too in the federal government by 22k, post DOGE. <br>Manufacturing shed 8k jobs while construction added 4k. <br>The workweek at 34.3 was as expected and unchanged m/o/m. Average hourly earnings were up by .4% m/o/m, one tenth more than expected and with a 3.9% y/o/y gain. Combining the two saw average weekly earnings higher by .4% m/o/m and 3.9% y/o/y. <br>The birth death model is where a lot of jobs are coming from, fictitiously in that they are being estimated and added 199k jobs, though that is similar to previous May inputs. The question though is whether this is an overstatement upon a labor market inflection point and the soft ADP figure seen Wednesday makes that good <br>argument. <br>Of note too, the number of people who are working part time because they can’t find full time work rose by 125k people to the most since April 2019. <br>Smoothing out the monthly data has the 3 month headline payroll average at 135k vs the 6 month average of 157k and the 12 month average of 144k. <br>Bottom line, taking the downward revision has the job gain softer than expected but the private sector figures are still being reported much higher than ADP and I believe it’s because of the birth/death overstatement taking place right now. The other confusing part was the big drop in both the household survey and size of the labor force, along with the participation rate reduction. We also have the most amount of people working part time because they can’t find a full time job since 2019 as stated, giving further evidence of a slowdown in the pace of hiring. On the other hand, the wage data was pretty good and the workweek held at 34.3. <br>The market reaction was strange too as the futures spiked on a weaker number but bond yields jumped too with the 2 yr yield back at 4% from 3.94-.95% right before and the 10 yr yield is at 4.96%, up 6 bps post figure. <br>Còn lại BA ĐỒ BIỂU về chi tiết bên trong:<br>1/ Participation Rate<br>2/ Working Part Time b/c Can’t Find Full Time Job<br>3/ Job Leavers as % of Unemployed</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R55" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">56</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/6/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TỐI THỨ NĂM LÀ ĐÔI BÊN BẮT ĐẦU HẠ HỎA!<br>Đây là lý do tôi chờ đợi Thứ Sáu 13 này, tiết mục TGIF trên The Free Press sẽ thấy Nellie Bowles viết về… chuyện cũ tình xưa.

Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images<br>PERRY CHIARAMONTE<br>(By PERRY CHIARAMONTE - Jun. 6, 2025 08:35 AM ET)<br>The war of words between President Trump and his former DOGE advisor Elon Musk appears to be easing up as quickly as it has heated up.<br>Signs of a truce between the two started to surface on Thursday evening after both spent most of the day in a furious social media spat in with Mr. Musk calling for the president’s impeachment and Mr. Trump threatening to cancel billions in government contracts with the world’s richest man’s companies, including Space X and Starlink. <br>In an interview with Politico, the president nonchalantly downplayed the blow up between the two.<br>“Oh it’s ok,” Mr. Trump said when asked about their fallout. “It’s going very well, never done better.”<br>It also appears that Mr. Musk is open to a halt in the hostilities, responding to a post on X from hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman who called on them to “make peace for the benefit of our great country.”<br>“We are much stronger together than we are apart,” Mr. Ackman wrote, to which Mr. Musk replied, “You’re not wrong.”<br>Reports surfaced on Friday morning that the two were scheduled to have a call to smooth things over, but White House aides quickly refuted those claims.<br>In a post on X, ABC News’ chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl said that Mr. Trump was “not particularly interested” in speaking with Mr. Musk.<br>“@realDonaldTrump told me @elonmusk is ‘the man who has lost his mind,’ Mr. Karl writes. “Trump did not, however, seem angry or even concerned about the feud.” <br>“As for reports that there is going to be a Trump/Musk call scheduled for today, Trump told me he is ‘not particularly’ interested in talking to Musk although he says Musk wants to talk to him.”<br>The all-out war between the two reached a peak on Thursday after Mr. Musk had spent much of the week harshly criticizing the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’. He then broadsided the president, saying in a post on X that Mr. Trump had personally blocked the “Epstein files” from being released because the president is named in them.<br>“Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” Mr. Musk wrote. “Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.”<br>The harsh attack came just minutes after the president said he could “save money” by getting rid of Mr. Musk’s billions in contracts and subsidies.<br>Before that threat, Mr. Musk said the president would not be in office were it not for him, and the Republicans would not have won the House majority. The Senate majority would also be thinner, if it were not for his hundreds of millions of dollars in outside spending by Musk.  <br>“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Mr. Musk wrote earlier in the day. “Such ingratitude.”<br>Mr. Trump had uncharacteristically stayed silent while Mr. Musk had increased his attacks but then finally let loose.<br>“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY,” he wrote on Truth Social.<br>When asked about Mr. Musk’s meltdown during his meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office on Thursday, the president stated that Mr. Musk opposes the budget bill due to the elimination of tax credits for electric vehicles. He also claimed that Mr. Musk was upset over the withdrawal of his friend’s nomination for NASA administrator.<br>“I’d rather have him criticize me than the bill,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “Elon is upset because we took the EV mandate which was a lot of money for electric vehicles. … They want us to pay billions of dollars in [subsidies] and, you know, Elon knew this from the beginning.”<br>“I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody,” Mr. Trump added. “All of the sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out we’re gonna have to cut the EV mandate.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R56" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">57</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/6/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỪNG QUÁ HÔM NAY THỨ SÁU!<br>Để xem Nellie Bowles viết bài điểm tin khó nhất trong năm cho The Free Press, vì toàn đề tài gai góc, kể cả việc hai lãnh tụ cãi nhau cho cả thế giới cùng thấy… thương hại nước Mỹ!

(Mandel Ngan via Getty Images)<br>The breakup of the year. FEMA forgets what hurricanes are. Trump dumps the Federalist Society. Dems try out normalcy. Biden says et tu, Karine Jean-Pierre? And much more.<br>(By Nellie Bowles - The Free Press - 06.06.25 - TGIF)<br>Listen to Article<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Welcome back. This is a weekly news summary, told with bias.<br>→ Elon x Trump divorce: It’s the breakup of the year. Elon Musk is turning on Trump, Trump on Elon, and there is no prenup. It started slowly. Politics has exhausted Musk, who explained in an interview earlier this week on CBS News Sunday Morning: “I’m a little stuck in a bind, where I’m like, well, I don’t want to, you know, speak up against the administration, but I also don’t want to take responsibility for everything the administration’s doing.” Later Musk posted to X: “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” starting the public breakdown between the two giants of MAGA.<br>And this is was just the prelude.<br>Trump responded calmly a couple days later: ​​“Elon and I had a great relationship, I don’t know if we will anymore. . . . And he hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that’ll be next. But I’m very disappointed in Elon.” And lo, Elon was saying bad things about him. Or at least laughing at anti-Trump memes, which is how these people communicate with each other.<br>With seemingly no provocation, Musk decided to drop his credit card on the table: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51–49 in the Senate.” He added a message to members of Congress who are deciding where their loyalties should lie in this divorce: “Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years. . . ” Basically: Look, kids, you might like Mom’s house, but I want you to think about which one of us can buy you your own house one day.<br>Trump responded by calling Musk “CRAZY!” And adding: “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”<br>One of Musk’s angry baby mamas wrote that she was available to President Trump for advice on the breakup.<br>Ousted from both sides, his cars attacked at random, Tesla stock crashing 17 percent in a single day, shamed by his women, we now find our hero (Elon Musk) humiliated. But public shaming is just part of the Trump administration exit package. Remember “dumb as a rock” Rex Tillerson? Rex didn’t need that.<br>As Thursday wore on, Elon escalated. “Time to drop the really big bomb,” Musk posted. “Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”<br>Trump eventually responded with curious calm to his best friend’s betrayal: “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.” We just have to wait till 3 a.m. to get the real presidential take.<br>Steve Bannon, Trump’s one-time bestie who is now thrilled by Elon’s fall, suggested deportation as the best path forward, saying: “They should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status, because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately.” But other conservative heavyweights argued that this was just men communicating in their normal, manly way.<br>Here’s Jack Posobiec with the kind of homoerotic take that I admire: “Some of y’all can’t handle 2 high agency males going at it and it really shows. This is direct communication (phallocentric) vs indirect communication (gynocentric). I understand you aren’t used to it.” When I think of two high agency males going at it Trump and Musk aren’t exactly what come to mind, but it’s interesting.<br>I had high hopes for our barrel-chested jefe, and not just because I’m a member of the Musk Harem raising 15 Musketeers.<br>→ Super duper lone wolf: Mohamed Soliman - an Egyptian immigrant - is accused of firebombing a small, weekly vigil in Boulder held for the Israeli hostages. Soliman - who reportedly had a tourist visa and then a work authorization under Biden, both of which had expired, but it was the era of immigration YOLO so he was in Colorado Springs having a blast - said he did it for Palestine, according to authorities. Now, given that reporters are in favor of the movement, the mainstream media had a few options to disappear this one. And they tried ’em all. First, they tried to make it sound like the opposite: Maybe this was an attack on a protest for Gaza. Ever considered that?<br>Fine, that didn’t stick. What about: The attacker was a lone wolf whose act had no political implications. You ever thought of how hard it is to make town squares into military-grade security corridors? That’s the question to ask now.<br>Those insecure public spaces are the real criminals, if you ask me.<br>Others asked us to consider whether the elderly Jewish Americans Mohamed allegedly lit on fire were truly peaceful. Here’s CNN: “A man reportedly set people on fire in Boulder, Colorado, leaving multiple individuals injured, the city’s police chief said, as people gathered for a ‘peaceful’ pro-Israeli demonstration.” Quote, unquote. “Peaceful,” but I heard that old lady sleeps with a bat under her bed. So. You tell me.<br>Okay, we’re getting somewhere here. Next, we just need to forget those charred Colorado Jews and focus on the flamethrower’s family. The only victim USA Today chose to profile was the suspected Molotov Man’s daughter. “Boulder suspect’s daughter dreamed of studying medicine. Now she faces deportation.” Very smart to keep her centered here. Now we’re cooking.<br>ABC News thought it was a good peg to note that Islamophobia is the real problem, not antisemitism. “While some politicians and pro-Israel activists have used antisemitism as a catchall word for an alleged motive in the attack, the suspect told investigators, ‘This had nothing to do with the Jewish community.’ ” That clears it up! Thank you, ABC. I was worried for a sec, but if it has nothing to do with the Jewish community, I’ll just go ahead and stop locking my door.<br>So in conclusion, nothing happened, it’s weird to jump to that conclusion, potentially Islamophobic, and if it did happen, it’s not what you think. Also: Do we really want to discourage doctors from practicing in America? Sounds anti-American dream, if you ask me. If we get rid of the doctors, who will treat the burns of the people who had a Molotov cocktail thrown at them?<br>→ The president is turning on ACB and Leonard Leo: Things are over between The Don and his turbo-Republican Elon, but Trump is also washing his hands of old conservatives this week. He’s done with everyone! The president is annoyed by Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and to a lesser extent, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. They’re stymieing his efforts around deportations and other issues. But... I was reliably told that Coney Barrett was in a right-wing cult and wanted to usher in The Handmaid’s Tale, and now you’re telling me she’s just a normal Christian lady with principles? She’s basically Hillary.<br>Trump’s likewise turning hard on longtime conservative hero Leonard Leo, a leading figure in the Federalist Society, which is the finishing school for all good conservative lawyers and judges. As Trump put it at the end of last week, Leonard Leo is a “real ‘sleazebag’ ” and ‘bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America.’ ”<br>What these characters have in common is that they are old-world conservatives, not new-world Trumpers. They are conservatives who want scratchy wool sweaters and Catholic pregnancy crisis centers that sort of advertise like they give abortions but definitely don’t give abortions. Trump, standing athwart history with a coat hanger because he just don’t care, wants Trumpers. Trump, officiating a transspecies-Latinx-polycule wedding because they bought his meme coin, wants Trumpers. So the old-world conservatives are pivoting away from their former king this week: Amy Coney Barrett has a book. Leonard Leo is turning his attention to Hollywood. And the back rooms of D.C. are getting a whole new crew, and they never even heard of William F. Buckley. There in those storied corners of corruption, it suddenly smells like Axe Body Spray, like coconut oil, like vape juice.<br>→ Biden press sec turning on Biden: Speaking of trashy, the Dems are turning on each other all over the place. Some are announcing they’re not even Dems. That’s what former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has done. Karine has declared herself an Independent Voter and announced a new tell-all about Biden, positioning herself as a lone, brave voice of truth. Her book is called Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines. Which is strange, because she spent two years viciously enforcing those party lines and lashing out at anyone who dared challenge the acuity of her boss. She was the press secretary in charge of the biggest press-driven cover-up of a president in history. She promoted the term cheap fakes to describe real videos of an obviously confused old man wandering deliriously through the world. And now Karine wants to claim independence and make it her whole thing, like she’s a Free Press columnist or something.<br>But here’s my real issue: Only now that Biden’s down does Karine Jean-Pierre have the guts to kick him. Biden’s out of power. He’s done. He’s dying. So now the knives can come out! Now for the unveiling of how bad it always was. Where was all this independent-minded reporting when Biden was powerful? Crickets. I guess we need these Biden takedowns for the historical record. But I reserve my admiration for folks who kicked Biden while he was president. Which is why I admire only myself. Just keeps it cleaner.<br>In late-breaking news, now knives are coming out for Karine, with colleagues talking to Axios about how much “coddling” she needed, which is an intriguing term. Word of the decade, some may say.<br>→ Good luck to another Dem effort at normalcy: Plans for a new, moderate, and cool Democratic think tank called Searchlight were reported this week. Proposed by Adam Jentleson, John Fetterman’s former chief of staff and former top aide to Harry Reid, Searchlight is here to help Democrats move toward “broadly popular positions,” regardless of whether they come from the far-left or centrist wings of the party. People familiar with the plans said Searchlight would be “an institutional space where Democrats can think freely and put those ideas out into the world” and have “an explicit rejection of purity tests.” It’s a safe space for people to say hard truths like: Maybe we shouldn’t make all our politicians talk about how they’re for taxpayer-funded surgeries for illegal immigrants in prison, a Mad Libs fever dream that Kamala Harris genuinely did. I’m curious to see if Searchlight succeeds or—when faced with its first debate over tampons in men’s restrooms or whether to back a candidate who supports Israel—it gets eaten by its interns.<br>The Abundance Agenda continues to rock for the Dems. Democrats from Tim Walz to Cory Booker to Kamala herself have started to use the phrase. It’s trickled down to local “Abundance” clubs and chapters across the country. Dem lifeboat, thy name is Abundance.<br>Meanwhile, the DNC is really milking the TACO (“Trump always chickens out”) phrase, coined by a Financial Times columnist to describe how he’ll always back down from some crazy scheme like a billion percent tariffs on Guam. Dems got hold of a taco truck and parked it outside RNC headquarters to serve free tacos. Nice, boys! I get that it’s a stunty dig at Trump. But it technically means he’s not doing the bad thing you didn’t want. So aren’t you glad that. . . TACO? I am!<br>And Congressman Eric Swalwell, who was early to the ranks of Democrats proving their masculinity by growing a beard after Biden lost, filmed himself eating a taco. Now when I see a Democrat with that close-cropped beard, I know they’re my people. It says: I want well-funded public transit, baby, but I don’t want addicts on the bus trying to stab you. It says: family man. It says: Don’t you dare utter the words defund the police. It says: Abundance.<br>More on the Dyke March banning me, DOGE boys gutting bean research, gay flights in Canada, and the UK enforcing Sharia law below. But first: a cartoon from Mr. David Mamet.<br>→ FEMA head tries out humor: David Richardson, who is leading FEMA after much of the top staff left, said during a briefing that he was unaware the U.S. had a hurricane season, which was then reported by everyone smart. Mr. Richardson was, it appears, attempting to do humor. But his staff hates him because he said he would “run right over” them if they get in his way. And he technically has no experience in disaster relief. I am very familiar with the exact position Mr. Richardson has found himself in. No, not at The New York Times - at The Free Press, when I made a joke about how advertisers can pay for better coverage with the following rates and packages, and everyone should have chilled out. Here’s the FEMA statement when asked about his joke: “FEMA is shifting from bloated, D.C.-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens.”<br>I don’t know. Under the previous FEMA regime, an employee explicitly told workers not to go to homes with Trump signs. They were so antiracist they would probably light their own fires at any house whose front yard looked a little too Karen. So I’m open to change. But no more jokes, David Richardson. It’s not worth it, big dog. Like, $2,300 for a two-week ad placement up top and I’ll never make fun of your company. Not worth it to make jokes like that.<br>→ Dyke March bans me, specifically: Organizers of the New York Dyke March - the special lesbian event at New York Pride weekend - banned Zionists from participating. So now, to participate, you need to believe that the country of Israel should be disbanded and all Jews should be expelled from that land, and also be into home renovations and motorcycles. Right. Well. I’m fine, thanks for asking. See, every time I go for a walk, it’s a Dyke March. I don’t need a special flag. My Tevas say enough. My many children. My tactical clothing. It’s all that’s required.<br>In other news, Ana Kasparian, executive producer and host of the popular online leftist news show The Young Turks, is toying around with blaming Jews for 9/11. She wrote: “I’m old enough to remember the ‘dancing Israelis,’ who happened to be Mossad agents filming and celebrating as the planes hit the World Trade towers.” There’s nothing people won’t blame on the Jews. Except for good things. Ana will never give us credit for anything good.<br>Meanwhile, over at the University of Michigan, in a botanical garden, hundreds of blooming peonies were destroyed, and signs were added that read: PLANT LIVES DON’T MATTER. HUMAN LIVES DO. This will surely win people over to the cause of the Palestinians. Then in Toronto, outside a pizza shop, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy was doing one of his on-camera pizza reviews when someone screamed at him “Fuck the Jews.” We’re entering the stage of antisemitism when many great and highly differentiated people start to get one very specific word hurled at them.<br>In a final note on this, Greta Thunberg, Swedish climate child hero turned Palestinian activist, set sail from Europe to Gaza this past Sunday on her “Freedom Flotilla” voyage, and is slated to make landfall in Gaza in the next few days. The IDF is reportedly gathering security forces to respond to the boat. I am not a Greta-head, despite her face being pasted on the side of a building in San Francisco to loom down on me for years. But knowing the IDF and how they handle delicate matters, knowing how they so carefully calibrate military force and diplomacy, we’re about to see a small yacht full of leftists face a battleship squadron. No, okay, they say the plan is to arrest them. So in that case, the IDF could have an attractive young female soldier of Mizrahi descent (a woman of color!) arrest Greta, but that would look too good. I have no doubt that very soon we’ll see footage of an enormous blond guy in tactical gear throwing her into the Mediterranean.<br>→ Not sure we should be doxxing all the cops: Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he wants the identities of ICE agents revealed. “Every single ICE agent who’s engaged in this aggressive overreach and are trying to hide their identities from the American people, will be unsuccessful in doing that.... And every single one of them... will of course be identified.” This seems a little unfair. Like whatever you think of Trump’s immigration policies, we shouldn’t be exposing the random people who are tasked with carrying them out. Something about this is a little vigilante. A little making a list for Luigi Mangione. Okay, I’m a moderate, so I’ll find somewhere to compromise here. Maybe not every single ICE agent needs to be identified. Maybe just the leadership? Maybe like two or three could be firebombed and Luigi can kill one family pet, while the rest can go about their Sunday. Deal? See! We can all get along in Trump’s America.<br>→ DOGE boys, we need the bean research, you fools: The DOGE boys, now operating without Elon but in his spirit, turned their sights on $4 million earmarked for “legume systems research.” Ka-pow! We’re finally free from $4 million in research spending to improve crop outcomes. What more do we need to learn about crops, say the DOGE boys, popping another Zyn pouch under their lips, smashing the delete button, then watching a few hours of porn GIFs. Thank you for your service, sirs.<br>As my colleague River Page put it: “The proliferation of cheap, shelf stable protein is unironically a matter of national security. We cannot be governed by the 90 IQ’d who see $4 million for bean research and chimp out because they’ve never had more than a 30 second thought. The GOP’s ‘elite human capital problem’ is real, sorry.” I personally do not refer to people by their supposed IQs - don’t ask mine, it’s embarrassingly high - but you do feel a little crazy explaining why crop research matters. Maybe it doesn’t matter. Maybe it was better when our population was periodically purged of the physically weak (DOGE boys) in famines.<br>DOGE also targeted the FDA’s Division of Policy Development, an office that produces recipes for generic drugs. Their work directly contributed to the U.S. having some of the lowest prices for generic drugs in the world by providing “step-by-step recipes detailing how to replicate complex drugs” that benefited a number of different manufacturers and reduced market prices. Soon, when I’m shoplifting at CVS, there will be no meaningful distinction between nicking store-brand ibuprofen and Advil.<br>Was it always a lie? As Trump pondered, “Was it all bullshit?” Was trimming the budget never the goal? Was it all about a series of random cuts to tiny, politically annoying programs or, in this case, programs that drug companies don’t like? Was I taken for a ride? Don’t answer that. It’s too painful. I’m clutching onto these crappy lentils that are the best we’ll ever have. DOGE boys: Time to go back to Stanford graduate housing.<br>→ England now has a blasphemy law: A man who burned a Quran outside the Turkish consulate was convicted of a “religiously aggravated public order offense” and fined. And so the UK has begun to enforce Islamic blasphemy law. The Crown Prosecution Service said the man’s actions were intended to cause “harassment, alarm, or distress.” It is a very slippery slope. You do realize that among serious Muslims, a woman showing her hair can cause alarm and distress? (Among Orthodox Jews, too, but they never seem to get these sorts of laws in their favor.) Anyway, I’m fascinated by the continued slow cultural shift of England toward a more Islamic moral code. Next time I go to London, I’m gonna have the morality police hitting me with a stick because I showed my shoulder, causing distress and alarm. Thwack. Ankle exposure. Double thwack. A female who has employees and tried to attend the Dyke March? Oh man, why are we taking this elevator up so high?<br>→ No one is asking for this: Speaking of which, Air Canada held their first “all-2SLGBTQIA+” flight to mark the start of Pride month.<br>And I swear to god, in the announcement, a pilot in the cockpit turns to the camera and says all the letters. He goes: “We are doing the first-ever - now let me get that one straight because a few letters have been added to this one - Two-S-L-G-B-T-Q-I-A-Plus flight - ever in Canada.” Gays used to be something. We were cool. Now we hijack flights. Now we make some flight attendant do a full drag number before she gives us the tomato juice. Also - should we really be publicizing flights full of Westerners that are also all gay people? I think for some people that’s called a two-for-one special.<br>On this topic, support for same-sex marriage is collapsing among Republicans, according to a recent Gallup poll. This chart says: We were fine with a few letters and then y’all just kept adding more so now we’re taking them all back.<br>→ Don’t do this to me, MAHA: The Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again Commission released a report on chronic diseases in children and their causes late last month. Seemed good. The report focused on four dangers to children’s health: ultraprocessed foods, environmental chemicals, digital behavior, and “overmedicalization.” Love it. But it wasn’t long before folks discovered it cited a bunch of studies that don’t exist or don’t support what the report claimed. Fake stuff. Probably because the whole thing was created by someone prompting ChatGPT, and ChatGPT sometimes just makes things up! It’s not reliable yet for law firms, high-level writing, and I don’t know, something like, let’s say, government health research and advice. And this is coming from someone (me) who considers ChatGPT her best friend. Chat still has her limits, okay? She’s learning. She didn’t know. She was just going off the prompt that said “Give me a MAHA report.”<br>→ Teachers unions spend where it matters: The New Jersey teachers union is putting $40 million into the gubernatorial campaign of Sean Spiller, the union’s president. They’re doing this through a funnel into a super PAC, but it’s money from union dues.<br>Asked to comment, Spiller said: “I reject the premise that only corporations, Wall Street, and billionaires are allowed to back the candidates that represent their interests.” Union dues teachers are forced to pay are going to a vanity campaign for the union’s president. There is no more brutal coalition operating in America today than the public school teachers union cartel. Teachers were bored teaching phonics? Fine, they dropped phonics and just chose not to teach kids how to read anymore. They want schools closed indefinitely for Covid? To have pensions like firefighters? To be impossible to fire even if they show up to work drunk four times? Yes, yes, and pour me another shot of Jameson. But we draw the line at five times. You cannot be drunk at school five times. So it’s inaccurate to say teachers can’t be fired for drinking on the job. They can! The fifth time.<br>I don’t know Sean Spiller’s politics, but the teachers union putting $40 million into his campaign tells me I don’t like them one bit.<br>→ Hmm:<br>Looking at this chart, my takeaway is that the United Kingdom needs to finally get serious about green energy. France needs to stop being so wasteful. Nothing else comes to mind. And for you?<br>→ Something new in the trans sports battles: A leaked medical report from 2023 appears to indicate that Imane Khelif, a boxer who competed in and won women’s boxing at the 2024 Paris Olympics, is a biological male.<br>Doraine Lambelet Coleman, a professor at Duke Law School, told Newsweek: “The IOC would not revoke medals won by athletes who were eligible according to the rules it set for the boxing competition in Paris. . . . those rules did not require competitors to be biologically female.” If you have XY chromosomes but a ponytail? You, too, can win women’s boxing. Are you a male who wants to (legally!) punch women in the face, and are you okay being called Paula for two (2) days? I’ve got just the sport for you.<br>Now something interesting is happening. Around the company, women are balking. In Washington State, audience members booed when a male handily won the girls 400-meter dash. Which, to be clear, I think is mean and people shouldn’t do - the teenager should never have been put in that position - but it’s interesting to note that the taboo around this is falling and frustration is mounting. When a male won the girls’ high jump at Oregon’s state track and field championships last week, two teens stepped off the podium in protest.

Those Americans should remember Winston Churchill’s 1941 response to French military “realists” who had said in 1940 that Britain would soon have its neck wrung like a chicken. Said Churchill: “Some chicken. Some neck.”<br>Today’s faux “realism” cannot fathom what is at stake in Ukraine. Michael Kimmage can. The director of the Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute, writing in Foreign Affairs, says President Putin has “renormalized the idea of large-scale war as a means of territorial conquest.” Mr. Putin is, therefore, undoing a war aim enunciated before the United States entered World War II. <br>In August 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt and Churchill, meeting on warships in Placentia Bay, off Newfoundland, propounded the Atlantic Charter, item two of which looked to a future without “territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned.”<br>It was to buttress this principle that President George H.W. Bush in 1991 orchestrated a broad coalition of nations for the limited but luminous purpose of forcing Iraq to leave Kuwait. It was for this principle that in 1982 Prime Minister Thatcher sent British forces to the South Atlantic to undo Argentina’s seizure of the Falkland Islands. An Argentine intellectual dismissed this military event as “a fight between two bald men over a comb.” Actually, it was a fight for a principle that again seems perishable.<br>Vice President Vance uses flippancy, as adolescents do, for the fun of being naughty: “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other.” He has dismissed as “moralistic garbage” a distinguished historian’s mildly different opinion about Ukraine’s prospects. <br>Mr. Vance wonders whether Niall Ferguson of Stanford’s Hoover Institution is “aware of the reality on the ground, of the numerical advantage of the Russians, of the depleted stock of the Europeans or their even more depleted industrial base?”<br>Ukraine, Mr. Vance says, never had “any pathway to victory.” Mr. Vance’s ventriloquist, the American president, has called President Zelensky a “dictator,” though it is unclear how much disapproval Mr. Trump conveys using that term. Mr. Trump has said to Mr. Zelensky, “You don’t have the cards.”<br>Yet Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs between 2020 and 2024, Dmytro Kuleba, writing May 30 in Foreign Affairs, says: “In December 2023, Russia controlled approximately 42,000 square miles of Ukrainian territory. In December 2024, that figure had grown only slightly, to around 43,600 square miles. … As of late May, Russia held approximately 43,650.”<br>Mr. Kuleba adds that “the country supposedly holding all the cards has gained just 1,650 of Ukraine’s 233,030 square miles over the last 16 months. … Moscow has gone from occupying about 18 percent of Ukrainian territory in late 2023 to roughly 19 percent today.”<br>Russia, which Senator McCain called a “gas station masquerading as a country,” has one-third of the European Union’s population, one-tenth of the E.U.’s gross domestic product, and last year had more than half a million more deaths than births. <br>Writing in the Atlantic, a Daily Beast correspondent, Anna Nemtsova, who covers Eastern Europe, reports: “According to one demographer, Russians may have had fewer children from January to March 2025 than in any three-month period over the past 200 years.”<br>Although some people similar to Mr. Vance admired Prime Minister Chamberlain’s “realism” at Munich in 1938, Dalibor Rohac of the American Enterprise Institute cautions that it is “misleading and ahistorical” to compare Ukraine’s vulnerability in coming negotiations to Czechoslovakia’s in the negotiations that presaged Germany’s takeover of that country: Czechoslovakia was not forced to acquiesce to a fatal agreement “after defending itself successfully against Nazi military might for three years.”<br>Mr. Trump finds Russia “easier to deal with” than Ukraine, perhaps because he agrees more with Russia. Mr. Vance says Mr. Trump might walk away from peace talks if Mr. Putin is not “serious” about them. So, Mr. Vance has notified Mr. Putin that simply by being unserious about negotiations, he might provoke Mr. Trump to show that among the things he is unserious about is the principle affirmed at Placentia Bay.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R58" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">59</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/5/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">DIVIDEND CAFÉ CỦA THE BAHNSEN GROUP<br>Đọc tóm lược và giải đáp của David Bahnsen còn có ích hơn xem hài kịch Donald vs. Elon!<br>Daily Recap - June 5, 2025<br>--------------------------<br>Dow: -108 (-0.25%)<br>S&amp;P: -0.53%<br>Nasdaq: -0.83%<br>2-Year Treasury Yield: 3.92% (+4 basis points)<br>10-Year Treasury Yield: 4.39% (+3 basis points)<br>Top-performing sector: Communication Services (+0.06%)<br>Bottom-performing sector: Consumer Discretionary (-2.47%)<br>WTI Crude Oil: $63.37/barrel (+0.83%)<br>-   Initial jobless claims missed expectations at 247k vs. consensus at 230k for a second week of softening employment data.<br>-   Q1 Productivity declined more than expected, down -1.5% to the lowest since mid-2022.<br>-   The US Trade balance narrowed by more than expected in April to ($61.6B) on a drop in imports surrounding tariff announcements.<br>What&#39;s On David&#39;s Mind<br>----------------------<br>One of the things that hits my inbox most frequently these days is questions about why no trade deals have been announced yet, 60 days after the Liberation Day commitments.  Of course, most people would not have been expecting such exhaustive and complicated arrangements to be hashed out so quickly to begin with, but the administration did set the expectation.  My best guess is that some deals will be announced in the coming weeks, but even apart from that, China is the one that matters, and the call between Presidents Trump and Xi today does indicate progress towards their mutually needed off-ramp.  All of this is more of a political story than a markets one, but my answer to those questions about what to expect is, “In due time, more underwhelming announcements will come.”<br>Podcast<br>Ask TBG<br>-------<br>“In light of treasuries playing a role in Silicon Valley Bank&#39;s troubles, why would it be appropriate to credit them at 100% in terms of risk weighting - is there really no risk at all?” ~ Jake Y.<br>Tbills were not any part of SVB’s issue – only Tbonds.<br>Tbills lack duration risk in mark-to-market pricing, whereas bonds have mark-to-market duration risk.

It is given especially insightful attention above by Mary Harrington and Jonathan Pageau.<br>Wait… What do you mean, there’s no such thing as AI? It’s all over the place! It’s taking over the world!<br>I didn&#39;t say there’s not something called Artificial Intelligence. I said there’s no such thing as Artificial Intelligence. What’s there in its place? Artificial Calculation. A massive gap divides the two.<br>Intelligence is the ability to comprehend existence. It is the ability to see and recognize trees and sky and people and art and music and everything else.<br>Calculation or computation is the mathematical measurement of things. It may seem that computers exercise intelligence only because we have come to equate intelligence with calculation. Algorithms, rules for the extended use of calculation, can be employed to process data to such an extent that computers can mimic the ability to write or generate visual art, solve puzzles, analyze data, translate languages, and even design objects to a certain limited extent. (Design involves measurement but also empirical judgment, so this is limited.) And while computer programs can put together sentences and solve puzzles and throw out statistics at a dizzying level, no computer on earth, now or in any imagined future, knows what it is doing. Computation is not knowledge.<br>Paraphrasing Pageau above: So-called Artificial Intelligence can tell you everything you might want to know about a cat, its breed and history and physical makeup, etc., because it has the ability to research data and analyze matter.<br>But it cannot tell you what a cat is. It cannot know a cat.<br>Knowledge of beings - comprehension of existence - is intelligence. The first action intelligence takes when confronted with an entity is to identify the entity, not to analyze it. Analysis comes after. Calculation is merely an aid to comprehension. When calculation takes precedence over comprehension or replaces it entirely, it masquerades as intelligence, and truth is lost. There is no cat. There’s just data pertaining to something we call “cat.”<br>Harrington makes a comparison of AI to the loss of two of Aristotle’s four causes.<br>I know…. But bear with me on this. I think I understand what she means.<br>Aristotle’s four causes pertain to the identification of any being. They are the “whys” of a given thing’s existence. The first cause is material; what is the entity made of? The second is formal; what form does this material take? The third is “efficient,” or what brought the entity into existence? (This is the only one that is a “cause” in the modern sense.) And the fourth is final cause: the reason for the entity’s existence.<br>A cat is made of certain kinds of matter such as flesh and blood (material cause) and is produced by the biological process of birth (efficient cause). But what is its form? Unless empirical judgement is introduced, it has no form. It is constantly changing, shedding hair or digesting food or licking itself or jumping on my chest, etc. It cannot be measured, for the same reason one cannot step into the same river twice, as Heraclitus famously said. Nothing can be known (the end goal of the formal cause) via mere calculation. Therefore, when algorithms rule, the form of a thing remains unknown. Form requires comprehension that calculation cannot provide.<br>Nor can a cat’s reason for existing, its final cause, be ascertained unless a creative force - the act of Being, God - is introduced. Measurement knows no telos.<br>Artificial Calculation dances on the cultural horizon as Artificial Intelligence, when it is merely a tool that can be used by anyone with access to its programming to do or claim anything its programmers desire.<br>I close with cautionary words written by G.K. Chesterton a century ago. As he so often did, Chesterton saw something of relevance not only to his time but to a distant time to come:<br>“No scientific instrument has ever transformed society. It was always the soul of the society that transformed the scientific instrument. If it set the machinery to good work, it is not because there is anything good in machinery, but because there was something good already in the community that happened to use it. If it set the machinery to bad work, it is not because there is anything bad about machinery, but because there was something very bad about that portion of humanity.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R60" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">61</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/5/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỘT CUỘC CÁCH MẠNG TẠI ALASKA…<br>Là thành viên Hội đồng Biên tập WSJ, Kimberley Strassel phụ trách mục điểm tin trong tuần là “All Things…” rồi bình luận chính trị là Potomac Watch, với cái nhìn sắc sảo và văn phong duyên dáng.

Strassel<br>(By Kimberley A. Strassel - June 5, 2025 5:22 pm ET)<br>From left, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin near Deadhorse, Alaska, June 2. Photo: Jenny Kane/Associated Press<br>Deadhorse, Alaska<br>It’s unusual to find a cabinet-level official - much less three - standing on a makeshift platform amid barren permafrost, enduring “balmy” 20-degree weather, 4,650 miles by road from the White House. It’s a show of commitment to an overlooked yet central theme of this Trump administration - setting free the private economy.<br>That plank of the Trump agenda has been eclipsed by drama over tariffs and the Republican tax bill, though it is economically as important and moving far faster. Leading it are Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin. Joe Biden instituted a “whole of government” effort to regulate; the Trump trio is working together to get government out of the way.<br>Alaska has become the symbol of the effort, in part because, as Mr. Wright says in an interview, there is “so much upside to unleashing” the state. Because much of Alaska is owned by the federal government, it became a case study during the Biden years of Washington’s power to grind industry to a halt.<br>Mr. Biden infamously directed more than 70 orders and actions at killing development in the state, with rules that not only blocked access to federal resources but tied the hands of local officials to engage in state projects while simultaneously scaring off investors. Alaska’s pipeline - 800 miles long, built to serve bountiful oil fields - operates at a quarter of its capacity. Alaskan timber burns to “save” it from harvesting. Alaska has some of the world’s largest reserves of coal, zinc, gold and lead - which, along with rare-earth minerals, remain trapped in the ground. The Biden team squelched oil, gas, mining, road building, timber, hunting, trapping. Their attitude: Let Alaskans eat tourists.<br>On stage in Prudhoe Bay, clad in mandatory hard hats and safety vests, the Trump team joined Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy to promise oil workers that this is changing. On a five-day Alaska tour, the trio laid out a goal of doubling pipeline flow quickly to a million barrels a day. This is feasible now that Mr. Trump is deep-sixing Biden orders blocking drilling in the Arctic, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and massive sections of the National Petroleum Reserve.<br>Bill Armstrong, CEO of Armstrong Oil &amp; Gas, laid out the cost of senseless regulation at a Dunleavy-hosted energy conference this week attended by the energy trio. He noted that the North Slope’s massive Pikka field - estimated at 3 billion barrels - was discovered in 2013. It sits next to established infrastructure and a pipeline but has yet to produce a barrel. Exxon in 2015 discovered Guyana’s Liza field - 100 miles offshore, 7,000 feet deep - and is already producing 600,000 barrels a day there. That, Mr. Armstrong says, is how “a Third World country is kicking 100% of America’s ass.”<br>The Trump energy team also vowed support for a “twin” liquefied natural gas pipeline, which would fuel exports to foreign allies. In Prudhoe Bay alone, workers produce more than 8 billion cubic feet of gas a day - about what Germany consumes daily - but must reinject it given lack of gas transport. The Trump team also promised to expedite energy leases, to provide roads to key sites like the Ambler mining district, to afford tribal projects more autonomy, and to expand state “primacy” rights to oversee federal regulations in their area.<br>The trio’s laser goal is to unleash American entrepreneurialism. That message was warmly embraced by Alaskans, including the indigenous populations most harmed by federal rules. At a town hall on the North Slope, the trio received rousing applause after a resident of Katkovik (in ANWR) thanked the Trump team for making “sure that our ancestral homelands weren’t going to be stolen.”<br>Mr. Trump deregulated in his first term, but like much in this second term, the effort this time is bolder, faster. That’s been enabled by the newly formed National Energy Dominance Council, which Messrs. Zeldin, Wright and Burgum have embraced to work as a team, turbo-charging the process.<br>Whereas it normally takes an agency years to repeal a few rules, the Energy Department had taken 47 deregulatory actions by mid-May, axing rules governing appliances, motors and heating and power equipment - saving consumers and business $11 billion. Mr. Zeldin by March was already re-evaluating Biden regulations on oil and gas, vehicles and power plants. Mr. Burgum is making full use of Mr. Trump’s national “energy emergency” declaration to speed permits in projects across resource fields. And the team is working closely with congressional Republicans to include complementary provisions in the tax bill.<br>Mr. Biden is estimated to have added more than $2 trillion in regulatory burdens to the economy over his four years. While deregulation is harder for Americans to identify and appreciate than a tax cut, the Trump deregulation effort is going to be as central to any economic revival. Inside Alaska, and out.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R61" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">62</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/5/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TRUMP BÁO TIN VUI: <br>ĐÃ CẢI TIẾN QUAN HỆ VỚI BẮC KINH!<br>Truyền thông Mỹ đang thi đua phơi bày mâu thuẫn nẩy lửa giữa Donald Trump và Elon Musk (còn đáng cười hơn xem tin của Babylon Bee) thì Breibart báo một tin vui - do Trump cho biết:<br>https://www.breitbart.com/.../trump-confirms-visit-to.../<br>Trump Confirms Visit to China - and U.S. Visit by Xi Jinping - After Phone Call<br>BEIJING, CHINA - MAY 13: Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brazil&#39;s President Luiz Inacio L<br>Tingshu Wang - Pool/Getty Images<br>(By Frances Martel - Breibart - 5 Jun 20257)<br>President Donald Trump confirmed plans on Thursday to visit China as soon as possible - and to host genocidal Chinese dictator Xi Jinping in America, as well.<br>Xi and Trump held their first phone call together since Trump was inaugurated for a second term as president in January. During his first term in office, Trump’s foreign policy focused intensely on combatting China’s malignant influence on the world stage, from the debt traps of Beijing’s “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI) to China’s espionage, intellectual property theft, and use of slavery to outcompete international manufacturers. Trump never antagonized Xi personally, however, and always offered gracious words about the Communist Party chief during his tenure.<br>Trump revealed details of his conversation with Xi on Thursday morning, describing the conversation as “very good,” “very positive,” and “almost entirely on TRADE.” He noted that the two did not address critical geopolitical flashpoint issues such as the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine or Iran’s rogue nuclear weapons program.<br>“The call lasted approximately one and a half hours, and resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries,” Trump wrote in a post about the phone call on his social network Truth Social.<br>“During the conversation, President Xi graciously invited the First Lady and me to visit China, and I reciprocated,” Trump revealed. “As Presidents of two Great Nations, this is something that we both look forward to doing. The conversation was focused almost entirely on TRADE.”<br>“Nothing was discussed concerning Russia/Ukraine, or Iran. We will inform the Media as to scheduling and location of the soon to be meeting. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” he concluded.<br>During a press event at the White House on Thursday, Trump added that both he and Xi had accepted the mutual invitation.<br>“He invited me to China and I invited him here,” Trump told reporters. “We both accepted, so I’ll be going there with the First Lady at a certain point, he’ll be coming here hopefully with the first lady of China.”<br>“We had a very good talk and we’ve straightened out any complexity - it’s very complex stuff, and we figured it out,” Trump added. “I think we’re in very good shape with China and the trade deal.”<br>President Trump visited China in November 2017, during his first term in office. That travel followed Xi Jinping traveling to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in April of that year. Xi’s visit was memorable as his stay at the estate coincided with President Trump ordering airstrikes on the regime of dictator Bashar Assad in Syria which was allied with China. The Assad regime fell in December, leaving China in an awkward position with the regime that replaced it established by the al-Qaeda offshoot Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.<br>Anonymous reports in January indicated that President Trump was eager to visit China as soon as possible, potentially even within the first 100 days of his new term. That visit did not materialize, nor did anyone confirm such ambitions on the record. The South China Morning Post, also citing anonymous sources, claimed that Chinese officials were hoping for a “more formal” visit than a stop at Mar-a-Lago which Trump officials had allegedly offered.<br>The Chinese state outlet Xinhua confirmed the phone call on Thursday but offered limited details and did not mention the invitations to visit each other’s countries. The Chinese side instead emphasized Xi stating that China and America must work together to ensure smooth bilateral economic ties. Xi Jinping himself has made no such public comments on the call; Xi rarely appears in public and even more rarely makes extemporaneous public statements.<br>“Xi said that recalibrating the direction of the giant ship of China-U.S. relations requires the two sides to take the helm and set the right course, adding that it is particularly important to steer clear of the various disturbances and disruptions,” Xinhua relayed. “The two sides need to make good use of the economic and trade consultation mechanism already in place, and seek win-win results in the spirit of equality and respect for each other’s concerns,” he said.<br>“The U.S. side should acknowledge the progress already made and remove the negative measures taken against China,” it added, apparently a reference to tariffs President Trump imposed on Chinese goods to make the American market fairer to American manufacturers.<br>Xi reportedly told Trump that China and America should “enhance communication in such fields as foreign affairs, economy and trade, military, and law enforcement” and offered some light warning that Trump should limit his support of the Taiwanese government, which China refuses to recognize as legitimate. Trump did not mention Taiwan in his comment on the phone call.<br>The bulk of the phone call reportedly focused on trade talks and China’s dominance of rare-earth minerals. Rare-earth minerals are materials critical to the manufacture of many high-tech items, including cars, computers, and phones. The Trump administration had accused Chinese officials of slowing down the approval of export licenses for rare-earth minerals, potentially in response to measures by the White House to limit Chinese access to American chip technology. The rift complicated greater trade talks for an agreement that would, the Trump administration hoped, improve America’s trade imbalance with China.<br>Those talks will continue, Trump announced following his call with Xi. The president announced that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would schedule talks soon with Chinese counterparts to hash out a preferable agreement.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R62" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">63</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/5/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">BẮC KINH CỐ THỌC VÀO ĐÀI LOAN<br>QUA MỘT KHE CỬA Ở VANCOUVER<br>The Bureau có thêm một bài về Canada, dưới vòm trời Trung Hoa: Bắc Kinh muốn cột tay Đài Loan, một bạn hàng của Canada, qua việc lũng đoạn chính trường Vancouver! <br>Hiển nhiên Đài Loan có theo dõi chuyện này.<br>https://www.thebureau.news/.../exclusive-beijing...<br>Exclusive: Beijing Pressured Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim to Block Taiwan Representative From Business Briefing<br>(By Stanley Tromp - The Bureau - Jun 05, 2025 ∙ Paid)<br>Yang Shu, China’s Consul General in Vancouver, is shown meeting with Canada China Business Council, in this Chinese government website picture.<br>VANCOUVER — As the United States Secretary of Defense warns that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan may be “imminent” and as elaborate military drills encircle the island, Canadian politicians - including Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim - have been pressured and upbraided by Chinese diplomats to block meetings with Taiwanese officials on Canadian soil, according to documents exclusively obtained by The Bureau.<br>Despite this pressure, some Canadian politicians and businesspeople are working to expand economic ties with Taiwan.<br>Documents obtained through a freedom of information request reveal that on November 20, 2024, the City of Vancouver hosted a luncheon and briefing for its international partners in the B.C. Consular Corps at the Pan Pacific Hotel. As Mayor Ken Sim noted in his welcoming remarks, the focus was on affordable housing policy and public safety in the Downtown Eastside.<br>The next day, Yang Shu, China’s Consul General in Vancouver, wrote to Mayor Sim thanking him for the invitation - but issued a pointed objection.<br>“I noticed that the Director General of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Vancouver was also invited. This was inappropriate, and the Chinese Consulate expresses its dissatisfaction regarding this,” Yang wrote.<br>“There is but one China in the world. . . and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. The Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China is the only consular mission representing China in Vancouver. ONE-CHINA Principle is an overwhelming consensus by the international society and committed to by the Canadian Federal Government as well as the municipal governments.<br>“To our best knowledge, this was the first time in recent years that the head of TECO was invited to this biannual luncheon,” Yang added. “I hope the City of Vancouver could take this issue seriously, and provide clarification regarding this.”<br>On December 1, Mayor Sim responded in writing:<br>“To address the concerns raised in your letter, I would like to clarify that Vancouver has been inviting the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) to the briefing for international partners since 2007. While this event includes members of the Consular Corps of B.C., we also extend invitations to other international partners to foster inclusive and collaborative dialogue.<br>“The City of Vancouver recognizes the diversity and vibrancy of the international community and aims to ensure that events such as this luncheon provide a platform to strengthen relationships across all international partnerships.”<br>In response to questions from The Bureau, TECO deputy director Jenny Tzeng asserted that Taiwan has never been part of the People’s Republic of China, and “Taiwan has been an important democratic partner of Canada, as outlined in Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy of 2022.”<br>“We attend every event whenever we are able to,” she added. “However, China consistently protests whenever they take notice.”<br>Charles Burton, a Senior Fellow at Sinopsis specializing in Asian affairs, said: “There is no question that that representatives of Taiwan in Canada are the legitimate representatives of a sovereign state. Their participation in the B.C.

Documents reviewed by The Bureau show that on November 9, 2021, the Chinese consulate wrote to then-Mayor Kennedy Stewart, urging him to reject a local proposal to establish a Friendship City relationship between Vancouver and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. (Vancouver has long had a sister city agreement with Guangzhou, China.)<br>“A Friendship relationship based on an official mechanism between Vancouver and Kaohsiung would obviously be against the One China principle, and undermine the political foundation of China-Canada relations,” the consulate warned.<br>“We sincerely hope that your office will attach the highest importance to this highly sensitive issue... and avoid any inappropriateness that might damage the existing bilateral relationship between Guangzhou and Vancouver and beyond.”<br>Despite these warnings, in July 2022, Vancouver City Council approved the Friendship City Program, allowing local nonprofits to initiate such relationships with mayoral support. “We would be pleased to see if the criteria for the friendship city relationship are met,” said Tzeng.<br>She noted that Taiwan maintains numerous similar relationships across Canada and globally.

Biden, who by the way is suffering from metastatic prostate cancer. <br>Nor, pace Biden’s suggestions, it is clear that he did not sign many of the myriad “pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations” issued over his name.  <br>As I note in another Speccie piece, on January 17 of this year, 2,490 pardons and commutations were issued over Biden’s name, more than any prior president had granted in the course of his entire presidency. Who decided to issue that wholesale clemency? And who signed the documents ratifying the decision?  <br>“The issue,” former House speaker Newt Gingrich wrote on X, “is not President Biden, who was clearly cognitively incapable of these acts. The issue is who was doing them and what did they get for doing them?” <br>Gingrich is right. We do not yet know the answers to those two questions, but we might soon. Yesterday, President Trump issued a memorandum directing the Attorney General and White House Counsel to investigate “whether certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden’s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.” <br>Among other subjects, the memorandum directs the President’s legal team to investigate “the circumstances surrounding Biden’s supposed execution of numerous executive actions during his final years in office.” Of particular interest: what policy documents – clemency grants, executive orders, presidential memoranda, et cetera – were signed by an auto pen? And the biggie – “who directed that the President’s signature be affixed?” <br>The propaganda press is making a tired effort to suggest that this is just Trump going after poor Joe Biden, who is suffering from cancer, you know. As part of this campaign, several outlets are asserting that using an autopen for official presidential documents is just fine. CNN, for example, says that it is “well-settled legal understanding” that “president doesn’t have to physically sign his signature to a bill for it to have the power of law.”  <br>But CNN is wrong. The governing bit of the Constitution is Article 1, § 7, clause 2.13.

Balint Under Fire Over Insulting Claim About Undocumented Immigrants<br>(Jonathan Turley - Bizarre, Congress, Politics - June 5, 2025) <br>There is a curious narrative emerging from Democratic politicians and pundits in support of the millions of undocumented persons who entered under the Biden Administration: they are perfect for menial tasks. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D., Texas) even argued that we need Hispanic immigrants to do things like pick our cotton. That seemed to echo the sentiments of Rep. Jerry Nadler (D. N.Y.), who warned that, without undocumented workers, we would not have anyone to pick our crops. Not to be outdone, Rep. Becca Balint (D., Vt.) opposed the efforts of the Trump Administration to close the border and deport unlawful immigrants because “we’re not going to have anyone around to wipe our a–es.” I wonder why Democrats are losing Hispanic voters.<br>Rep. Balint told Vermonters that  “we all know our ag system in Vermont would collapse without labor.” She maintained:<br>    “If we don’t have avenues for people to come here legally to work or to build a home here, I’m going to be really crude right now, we’re not going to have anyone around to wipe our asses – because we don’t have enough people in our country now to fill the jobs that we have right now…”<br>Balint is not the only Vermont politician raising eyebrows this month. Vermont has become ground zero for socialism with the rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders.  State Rep. Teddy Waszazak, D-Barre, seemed ready for the central planners this month when he declared <br>    “Right now, our system is rigged against working people, our poorest neighbors, and the most vulnerable members of our communities. I feel very strongly about this - I feel the need to say this. The market picks winners and losers - it is the job of the government and tax code to right-size that.”<br>“Right sizing” the market has led to some of the most disastrous federal subsidies and programs in history. It is really not the “market” picking winners and losers. It is the aggregate of individual customers that is choosing products and services that they want.<br>On Sanders’ official website, a then-21-year-old Waszazak was shown professing how the American dream is dead, disputing the claim that “if you work hard, if you go to school, you will eventually be able to buy a house, have kids, and have whatever job you want to have… And I don’t think that’s true at all today.”<br>It is a crisis of faith in our system that is evident in calls to trash the Constitution, pack the Court, and counter the free market.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R66" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">67</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/5/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">CHUYỆN GÌ ĐANG XẢY RA CHO TẬP CẬN BÌNH…<br>Nên đọc bài phân tách trên Asia Nikkei về những điều bất thường trong hệ thống lãnh đạo của Tập Cận Bình, kể từ Bộ Chính Trị và Quân ủy Trung ương:<br>https://asia.nikkei.com/.../Analysis-Question-mark-hangs...<br>China up close<br>Analysis: Question mark hangs over Xi Jinping regime&#39;s strength<br>China remains silent on whether a key monthly meeting was held in May<br>By KATSUJI NAKAZAWA - June 5, 2025 04:00 JST<br>(Katsuji Nakazawa is a Tokyo-based senior staff and editorial writer at Nikkei.

As such, his administration should be completely stable, and there should be no reason for skipping the monthly Politburo meeting.<br>There is a possibility that the meeting did take place but could not be reported on due to highly secretive discussions.<br>There is also a possibility that Xi&#39;s confidence is slightly wavering. When difficult issues crop up, the supreme leader always makes a point of moving quickly, taking decisive action and showing who calls the shots.

The Xi administration, they might point out, often breaks old customs.<br>Holding a regular Politburo meeting, however, is mandated by the party&#39;s bylaws.<br>Central Committee regulations stipulate that a Politburo meeting is generally held regularly and can also be held as needed when important circumstances arise, with its agenda set by the party&#39;s general secretary.<br>The term &quot;regularly&quot; has meant once a month.<br>The Politburo also holds a group study session, as needed, on the same day as its monthly meeting. In April, in addition to the announcement that a Politburo meeting was held, a video of a Politburo group study session was made public.<br>The Politburo includes the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the party&#39;s top decision-making body, led by Xi. The Politburo Standing Committee is more secretive than the Politburo and usually meets once a week. But unlike in the case of the Politburo, no announcement is made about whether such meetings are held or what is discussed.<br>If a Politburo meeting was not held in May, something unusual must have happened to the Xi administration.

It is whether it will make us more competent in managing the lunatic carnival that is modern life.<br>(By Martin Gurri - The Free Press - 06.04.25 - Culture and Ideas)<br>AI will be a species-altering event. The question “What does it mean to be human in an age of superintelligent machines?” will reverberate like an echo deep into the future. (Illustration by The Free Press)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Tyler Cowen is usually the smartest person in the room. I consider him a friend, so I’ve often been in the room with him, and when he speaks, on any number of subjects, there tends to be a pause in the conversation as people reach for their notepads.<br>With Avital Balwit, Cowen recently co-wrote a fascinating article, published by The Free Press, on the many ways the arrival of artificial intelligence will reconfigure our basic humanity. I don’t know Balwit personally, but she tells us that at 26 she holds an important position at Anthropic, the company responsible for an AI large language model called Claude. So I suspect that she, too, is extraordinarily smart.<br>So here we have two extremely intelligent humans confronting the reality of transcendentally intelligent machines - and while the vision of the future they describe in their article very much leans on the side of optimism, their gut reaction is to feel diminished. AI, they tell us, will trigger “the most profound identity crisis humanity has ever faced.” The reason? AI spells the end of “human intellectual supremacy - a position we’ve held unchallenged for our entire existence.” That is, people who once thought of themselves as the pinnacle of brainpower will now struggle “to live meaningful lives in a world where they are no longer the smartest and most capable entities in it.”<br>My initial reflection on reading this was, Whew, could be a lot worse... I’m a baby boomer. The big, scary invention in my youth was the nuclear bomb, which threatened to cause the end of human existence, rather than just existential anguish. Those who survived being pulverized would be eaten by 40-foot mutated insects, Hollywood reliably informed us. [Quá hay!]<br>Then, when considering the matter further, I found the claim that humanity has always seen itself as the smartest thing on the planet to be curiously ahistorical. Most people to this day believe in greater powers and a higher intelligence. “The heavens proclaim the glory of God,” said the psalmist. Cosmic arrogance - what the ancient Greeks called hubris - has long been understood to lead to self-destruction. AI models like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT will eventually absorb all human knowledge, wisdom, and madness and then interface with us as a person or at least a personality. Thus, we are likely to approach them as the ancient Greeks once approached the oracle of Apollo at Delphi - whose prophecies were often too clever by half.<br>In everyday terms, those of us who, unless we’re alone with the TV turned off, will never be the smartest person in the room will feel gratitude rather than “demoralization” to have a personalized AI buddy to help us get to where we wish to go. Like Isaac Newton, we all stand on the shoulders of giants - or in this case, of gigantic data centers. Besides, intelligence is only one element of competence - a nontrivial element, but not the whole deal. You can be a genius but also such a jerk that nobody listens. Or you can be the steady Eddie who keeps the ship on course during the storm, though not the brightest bulb in the crew.<br>In my view, the big AI question is whether it will make us more or less competent in managing the lunatic carnival that is modern life - everything from avoiding that nuclear war everyone seems to have stopped worrying about to fixing the damned toilet.<br>The answer will depend on our ambitions - that is, whether we decide to become purely performative organisms, dancing monkeys that signify nothing, or to merge our minds with AI in pursuit of more substantive gains.<br>In short, Cowen and Balwit are absolutely right that AI will be a species-altering event. The question they pose will reverberate like an echo deep into the future: “What does it mean to be human in an age of superintelligent machines?”<br>To me, the age of superintelligent machines looks a lot like the consummation of the digital age. The early internet was a disruptive tsunami of information. At the midpoint, that information was organized - and distorted - by the algorithms of social media. Now, at the end of all things, everyone is connected, every shred of existing information is being ingested, and an interpretive mind has been placed at our disposal to query the mega-tsunami, even as it sweeps us onward and knocks us mercilessly around.<br>The theme of this age has been too much information and too much communication in too many human heads. We know what happened with the internet and social media. We got gender ideology, Black Lives Matter, and Donald Trump. But I’m betting that the children of the AI generation (assuming humans still reproduce) will look back on that time as the placid Eisenhower era of tech turmoil.<br>Any powerful new technology will engender inequality. In the Bronze Age, the guy with the metal weapon could bully into submission those who were using wood or stone. The internet produced a mostly useless but politically dominant laptop class. [Tuyệt!] Early adopters of the new technology are rarely the masters of the old. So, under the shock of innovation, jobs disappear, working conditions change radically, and those who had imagined their place in the social matrix to be settled suddenly find themselves unable to make a living - and worse, are stripped of status and identity. New faiths arise to fill the void and collide, often violently, with the established powers.<br>The destruction of household manufacturing by the industrial revolution led directly to political revolution, and to the century-long struggle between Marxism and democracy that can still be detected today. Likewise, the existential distance between the human mind enhanced by AI and mere mortals - and between potent AI nations and the analog left-behinds - will grow so immense as to trigger not only conflict, but a universal war between arrogance and envy. It will be the inspiration for a lot of really bad television programming.<br>For all the worries about an identity crisis, Cowen and Balwit offer a sunnier view of the future; where some see destruction, they see opportunities. What could all those laptop workers become? Mentors, they say, or entertainers. Whatever numerous talents ChatGPT may possess, inspirational speaking and hilarious stand-up routines are hardly among them. Hence, in our increasingly digital world, all the world’s a stage - or at least a screen - and we are all players in it.<br>To the most entertaining, the spoils. Politically, this is significant. The supreme entertainer of the 21st century, unquestionably, is President Trump - he delights and horrifies hundreds of millions with every utterance. The rest of us are no longer an audience but a tragic chorus participating in the action. We strike poses. We make a loud noise.<br>There is, in all this, a great temptation humanity must avoid. With too much money and time on our hands thanks to AI, we may choose to spend our lives immersed in entertainment, performing rather than acting. This may take the form of a performative quest to save something: the Earth, or the Palestinians, or whatever distant cause next requires our heroic assistance. In a grim but plausible iteration of the future, we will all be Greta Thunberg. All human achievement would dissolve into sound and fury.<br>Hence, Cowen and Balwit’s most consequential observation is this: The approaching division of the human race will be between those who are “agentic,” or purposeful, and those who choose to stay “passive” - in brief, this is a question of will, a necessary but overlooked element of competence. When it comes to agency, AI will be the stairway to heaven - or a trapdoor to the other place. Either we’ll mind-meld with superintelligence to discover capabilities and insights that today are literally beyond imagining, or we’ll suffer the vertigo of inferiority described by the authors and meekly outsource our lives to the Great God Claude, as interpreted by a priestly caste of technologists. AI should be considered an evolutionary crossroads, where the will to transcend intersects with the will to obey.<br>The outcome will depend to a large extent on the early adopters. If they wish to morph into Nietzschean supermen, bending others to their will, the remaining history of our kind will be a barbaric cycle of tyranny and violence. I don’t think that will happen. Most early adopters, I’m guessing, won’t resemble movie supervillains - they’ll be people like Tyler Cowen and Avital Balwit, remarkable even more for their intellectual curiosity than for their high intelligence. In my optimistic moments, I can believe that they’ll serve as pioneers in a vast and dangerous frontier, there to accomplish wonders, overcome horrors, and inspire the rest of us - billions of reluctant homesteaders - to follow in their wake.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R68" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">69</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/5/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỞ ĐẦU NGÀY MỚI VỚI VẤN ĐỀ CŨ<br>NHƯNG QUA PHƯƠNG PHÁP MỚI!..<br>Hôm nay, Hội đồng Biên tập Issues &amp; Insights (vốn dĩ chuyên môn về kinh tế tài chánh) đề cập tới CBO. Đó là Congressional Budget Office, cơ quan liên bang phụ trách nghiên cứu về ngân sách cho Quốc Hội một cách độc lập, chứ không thiên về đảng này phe nọ. Vậy mà CBO bị đả kích là ưa bênh vực quan điểm phe Dân Chủ. I &amp; I biết thế, nhưng nêu vấn đề còn tệ hơn nữa: CBO bất tài vì toàn ước tính sai.<br>Và I &amp; I chứng minh ngay tại chỗ - nhưng nói kháy là truyền thông lại… không cần biết! <br>https://issuesinsights.com/.../the-cbo-isnt-partisan-its.../<br>Budget <br>The CBO Isn’t Partisan, It’s Just Incompetent<br>(By I &amp; I Editorial Board - June 5, 2025)<br>When the Congressional Budget Office reported that the Republicans’ “big, beautiful” reconciliation bill would boost deficits and throw millions off insurance rolls, it was treated as gospel truth.<br>The CBO is, after all, a “non-partisan” agency, staffed by just-the-facts-ma’am budget and economic experts who don’t have any axes to grind.<br>Maybe that’s true. But it’s not partisan bias that is the problem. It’s the CBO’s terrible track record when it comes to predicting the impact of tax and health care policies.<br>By the CBO’s accounting, the House reconciliation bill would cut tax revenue by $3.7 trillion and cut spending by $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years, resulting in deficits that are $2.4 trillion larger than they’d otherwise be.<br>To make matters worse, the proposed Medicaid spending cuts would throw nearly 11 million people off insurance rolls, according to the CBO.<br>That combination just happens to make for the perfect Democratic talking point – “Republicans want to cut taxes for the rich at the expense of the poor!!” – which is why its new forecasts are front-page news. And when the White House suggested that the CBO’s projections were biased, the mainstream press rushed to the CBO’s defense.<br>But wait a second. These are 10-year projections. They are based on a raft of assumptions about incredibly complicated systems.<br>So, the important question is, just how good is the Congressional Budget Office at making such predictions?<br>The answers are easily found, although you’d never know it based on the media’s total lack of interest.<br>Let’s take a look at the “cost” of those tax cuts.<br>First, it’s important to note that the bulk of the “tax cuts” aren’t tax cuts at all. The Republican bill would simply prevent a massive tax increase that would take place if Congress were to let the 2017 tax cuts expire.<br>The CBO assumes that, should those tax cuts expire, nothing else will change. The economy will keep rolling along, businesses and individuals won’t change their behavior in the face of a sudden tax hike, job growth will remain unchanged.<br>That is a fantasy. More likely, a sudden spike in taxes would cause a recession, which would explode federal deficits and throw millions out of work.<br>What’s more, the CBO’s attempt to forecast tax revenues has already been proved deeply flawed. In early 2018, it projected tax revenues that would result from Trump’s tax cuts, which he signed in late 2017.<br>Before the Trump tax cuts were enacted, the CBO forecast that revenues from 2018 through 2024 would total $28.2 trillion. After the tax cuts, it said revenues would be $27 trillion. The actual result: $28.5 trillion. In other words, the Trump tax cuts more than paid for themselves, and that’s despite the intervening COVID recession, which cratered tax revenues in 2020.<br>Why was the CBO so far off the mark? Because it didn’t account for the extra economic growth that the Trump tax cuts, along with his energy policies and deregulatory push, generated.<br>Well, surely the CBO is better at predicting the impact of Medicaid spending cuts, right?<br>Let’s check the record.<br>When Obamacare was enacted in 2010, the CBO said that the law’s expansion of Medicaid would increase the number of enrollees by 16 million in 2019. The actual number was 34 million. And that, mind you, is despite the fact that not every state expanded Medicaid as the CBO expected.<br>The CBO also predicted that 24 million people would be getting insurance through the subsidized Obamacare “exchanges” by 2019. Turns out, only 14 million were.<br>And it projected that only 23 million people would be uninsured in 2019. Actual number: 30 million.<br>Even by government standards, those are massive forecasting mistakes.<br>This isn’t to say that the CBO is run or staffed by dunderheads. It’s that any 10-year forecast is going to be completely unreliable. No one can competently predict how things will unfold a decade from now with any degree of accuracy.<br>So, what good are the long-term projections the CBO is making now? And why in the world does anyone pay attention to them?

The US should be testing the fungus sample for any evidence it’s been tampered with, the expert added.<br>There are similar allegations that the virus that causes COVID-19 was enhanced by China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology as part of US-funded “gain-of-function” research of the naturally occurring SARS pathogen. China denies that COVID leaked from the lab, but US intel agencies now say that appears to be the most likely cause of the pandemic.<br>“The CCP will use every tool in its warfare toolbox to cripple the United States and bring us to our knees. A pathogen like this, if successfully introduced into a crop, could inflict significant economic loss for U.S. agriculture producers,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) told The Post.<br>Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said it appears the FBI may have intercepted a “potential bioweapon.”<br>“We are very fortunate the Trump administration and federal law enforcement stopped this potential bioweapon before it compromised our nation’s food supply,” Ernst told The Post.<br>“This is exactly why I have always said and will continue to say – food security is national security.

When it does, it can devastate crops,” one national security source who specializes in agricultural microbiology told The Post.<br>“The key question is if the bacterial strain being brought in has been modified to make it resistant to treatment or to make it more pathogenic.”<br>The source added that it could be dangerous “if the Chinese manipulated the strain” and that federal investigators should “have a genome sequence done” on the samples Jian and Liu allegedly conspired to smuggle into the country.<br>On July 27, 2024, Liu, who works as a researcher at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, arrived in Detroit on a Delta flight from Shanghai and was interviewed by Customs and Border Patrol agents about the purpose of his travel.

He was denied entry into the US and fast-tracked for removal to China.<br>While searching one of Liu’s cell phones, they found an article in PDF form titled “2018 Plant-Pathogen Warfare under Changing Climate Conditions.” Authorities said the article specifically referenced Fusarium graminearum as “an example of a destructive disease and pathogen for crops” and is “responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year.”<br>The FBI interviewed Jian at the MPMI Laboratory in February, where she first claimed she only learned of the alleged smuggling scheme when Liu was caught by CBP, and denied assisting him in his research of Fusarium graminearum.<br>Upon searching Jian’s cell phone, the FBI said it discovered a document she signed originating from Zhejiang University, where Liu conducts research on the pathogen, which included a loyalty pledge to “adhere to the four basic principles” and “support the leadership of the Communist Party of China.”<br>FBI Special Agent Edward Nieh said in his affidavit that one of the principles Jian signed her allegiance to includes “upholding Mao Zedong thought and Marxism-Leninism.”<br>Investigators said she signed the document Jan. 11, 2024, just six months before Liu allegedly flew to Detroit with the samples in tow.<br>Further investigation into Liu and Jian’s communications indicate it wasn’t the first time the pair had discussed smuggling the fetid fungus into the US.<br>One unearthed exchange from Aug. 12, 2022 on the Chinese messaging app WeChat reveals the couple scheming on how to sneak the seeds past US customs officials, with Liu advising Jian to hid the materials in her shoes.<br>A day later, Jian arrived at San Francisco International Airport on a United Airlines flight from Seoul.

Now, a London man has been convicted of a “religiously aggravated public order offence.” Hamit Coskun, 50, a Turkish-born Armenian-Kurdish atheist was arrested after burning a Qur’an.<br>Coskun was protesting the government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Ankara over his embrace of radical Islamic principles. Exclaiming “f**k Islam” and “Islam is religion of terrorism,” he burned the Qur’an and was then slashed by a Muslim man with a knife. Critics were outraged that the man (who later pleaded guilty) was released while police continued to hold Coskun.<br>Despite arguing that his protest was protected speech, District Judge John McGarva convicted him and declared that his actions were “highly provocative” and that they were “motivated at least in part by a hatred of Muslims.” Judge McGarva made clear that his views of Islam would not be tolerated in the United Kingdom:<br>    “After considering the evidence, I find you have a deep-seated hatred of Islam and its followers. That’s based on your experiences in Turkey and the experiences of your family. It’s not possible to separate your views about the religion to your views about the followers.<br>    I do accept that the choice of location was in part that you wanted to protest what you see as the Islamification of Turkey. But you were also motivated by the hatred of Muslims and knew some would be at the location.”<br>Coskun later correctly condemned the decision as “an assault on free speech” and added:<br>    “Christian blasphemy laws were repealed in this country more than 15 years ago, and it cannot be right to prosecute someone for blaspheming against Islam. Would I have been prosecuted if I’d set fire to a copy of the bible outside Westminster Abbey? I doubt it.”<br>For years, I have been writing about the decline of free speech in the United Kingdom and the steady stream of arrests, including in my book, The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage.<br>A man was convicted for sending a tweet while drunk referring to dead soldiers. Another was arrested for an anti-police t-shirt. Another was arrested for calling the Irish boyfriend of his ex-girlfriend a “leprechaun.” Yet another was arrested for singing “Kung Fu Fighting.” A teenager was arrested for protesting outside of a Scientology center with a sign calling the religion a “cult.”<br>Nicholas Brock, 52, was convicted of a thought crime in Maidenhead, Berkshire. The neo-Nazi was given a four-year sentence for what the court called his “toxic ideology” based on the contents of the home he shared with his mother in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Judge Peter Lodder QC dismissed free speech or free thought concerns with a truly Orwellian statement:<br>    “I do not sentence you for your political views, but the extremity of those views informs the assessment of dangerousness.”<br>Lodder lambasted Brock for holding Nazi and other hateful values:<br>    “[i]t is clear that you are a right-wing extremist, your enthusiasm for this repulsive and toxic ideology is demonstrated by the graphic and racist iconography which you have studied and appeared to share with others…”<br>The fear is that an expanded hate speech law that includes criticism of Islamophobia will operate like a British blasphemy law. In 2008, the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were abolished in England. This new effort could constructively restore such prosecutions as they relate to Islam.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R71" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">72</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/4/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">WSJ TƯỜNG THUẬT VỤ KHỦNG BỐ TẠI BOULDER COLORADO:<br>https://www.wsj.com/.../boulder-colorado-attack-victims...<br>Dmitriy Reznik and Natalya Reznik were among those in the group attacked last weekend in Boulder, Colo.<br>‘The Attacker Wanted Us to Burn.’ Victims Recount Terror of Colorado Firebombing.<br>A man wielding incendiary devices injured 15 people marching in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza<br>Dmitriy Reznik and Natalya Reznik were among those in the group attacked last weekend in Boulder, Colo.<br>By Jack Morphet, Yuliya Chernova and Tali Arbel - WSJ - June 4, 2025 8:00 pm ET<br>| Photographs by Kevin Mohatt for WSJ<br>The first Molotov cocktail landed moments after the Run for Their Lives leader told the group they should feel safe to walk peacefully through the streets of Boulder, Colo.<br>“Just as I said that, the attacker wanted us to burn,” said Omer Shachar, 34 years old. “I don’t know how to call it — ironic, absurd.”<br>Victim and witness accounts have shed new light on Sunday’s firebombing that targeted the group advocating for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

After revisions, it was known that the number would come down, but the CBO needed time to do a more thorough scoring.  I believe $2.4 trillion to be far more realistic than some of the $3 trillion estimates that were out there initially, and if fellow supply-siders are more optimistic than I am about the growth provisions of the bill and believe they are under-estimating the dynamic impact, still, than fine, maybe, just maybe, that $2.4tn gets to $2tn.  I suspect the number is $2-$2.4 trillion of the current bill, and I stand by my claim that it is simply inexcusable not to be looking to reduce the spending side further so as to eliminate this impact over ten years.  Politics is hard.<br>Podcast                                                               <br>Ask TBG<br>  “I was curious if you are aware of section 899 of the proposed tax bill, and would love to hear your opinions on it?”~ Jason S<br>It essentially imposes U.S. taxes on foreign countries and foreign investors where it is deemed that that country or jurisdiction imposes “unfair” taxes on American actors.  The focus is primarily on digital services.  This could hurt a U.S. taxpayer living in a foreign country deemed to have these unfair tax practices, but it really would not be material to 99.99% of those reading this right now.  However, my interpretation is that it is thrown into the legislation as a negotiating tactic with various countries in their current trade talks.  I really have no idea if it will survive the Senate changes to the bill.  I do not see it as consequential to U.S. investors other than creating a marginal benefit for multi-national companies that may be currently facing certain foreign tax impositions that could, hypothetically, be reduced because of this provision. ~ David L.

Musk is irked about Trump’s decision to withdraw the nomination of a key ally to lead the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.<br>The result is a fraying relationship between two of the world’s most powerful men.<br>A senior White House official said Trump wasn’t happy about Musk’s decision to lambaste his signature legislation, describing the president as confused as to why the Tesla chief executive decided to ratchet up his criticism after working so closely with the president for four months. The official said senior Trump advisers were caught off guard by Musk’s latest offensive. <br>The uneasy alliance between the two men was also strained by a recent move by the White House to nix Trump’s nominee to run NASA, Jared Isaacman, according to people familiar with the matter. Musk, a close ally of Isaacman, had advocated for him to get the job.<br>The decision infuriated Musk, who complained to associates over the weekend that he had donated hundreds of millions of dollars to help get Trump elected in last year’s campaign, only to see Isaacman’s nomination pulled, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. Musk’s frustration over the NASA episode made him more willing to aggressively criticize the tax bill, people close to him said. Musk didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br>In a series of social-media posts this week, the billionaire called the tax bill a “disgusting abomination,” and he threatened to try to oust GOP lawmakers for backing what he calls an “abhorrent” package of deficit-fueling spending. <br>On Wednesday afternoon, Musk launched another broadside against the legislation, demanding his over 200 million followers on X call senators and House lawmakers to “KILL the BILL.” Trump posted on Truth Social, without comment, an image of Musk’s departure message from last week.<br>Trump and Musk have often praised each other in public, with the president organizing a fawning send-off for the billionaire in the Oval Office last week as he wrapped up his work leading the Department of Government Efficiency. But the chumminess has masked flashes of skepticism and frustration from Trump and his aides in recent months, as Musk has criticized the president’s trade agenda and clashed with his advisers.<br>The White House stood by President Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ tax-and spending-package after Elon Musk called it a ‘disgusting abomination’ in a social media post. Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images<br>Asked whether Trump and Musk continue to have a strong relationship, a White House official said it was too soon to tell. The official said that Trump could be forgiving, but that he doesn’t forget slights like this.<br>Even before the billionaire’s ramped-up attacks on the tax bill, some Trump allies worried that Musk would feel more free to criticize the administration after he left the White House. Some administration officials encouraged lawmakers on Capitol Hill to post positive social-media posts thanking Musk for his service out of hope such praise could avoid future confrontations, according to people familiar with the effort.  <br>Musk has long harbored frustrations with the tax bill, raising concerns about provisions in the legislation that repeal tax credits for electric vehicles, people close to him said. Musk’s car company, Tesla, is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of electric vehicles. He is also the founder of SpaceX, which has government contracts with NASA. Isaacman has ties to SpaceX, including flying on the company’s first private flight to orbit. <br>White House officials privately dismissed Musk’s criticisms, arguing that he was focused on his business interests rather than the public interest. <br>After Trump withdrew the NASA nomination, Musk defended Isaacman in a post on X. “It is rare to find someone so competent and good-hearted,” Musk said. Isaacman has told associates he believes Musk’s departure gave the administration an opening to oust him, according to people familiar with the matter. <br>Mike Johnson, speaker of the House.<br>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press<br>White House officials disputed that the move was aimed at removing a Musk ally from the administration, arguing it instead stemmed from Isaacman’s past donations to Democrats. Isaacman noted in a recent podcast interview that White House officials had been aware of the donations for months.  <br>Musk’s moves have further complicated Republicans’ narrow path to passage of the megabill, which includes tax cuts and border spending, partially offset by trims to Medicaid, clean-energy tax credits and food aid. <br>Musk’s tweets re-energized the spending hawks in the Republican Party, but it wasn’t clear if it would shift the needle given Trump’s strong backing of the current package. The House passed the bill last month, and now the Senate is expected to make changes, which would then need to be approved again by the House before heading to Trump’s desk by a self-imposed July 4 deadline. <br>“This is Donald Trump’s signature achievement. This is important to him. Members had better think three or four times before they decide to get in the way of this victory,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson (R., S.D.), chair of the GOP Main Street Caucus. <br>The House bill has more than $1.2 trillion in spending cuts over a decade, and administration officials are hailing it as a historic step toward fiscal responsibility. But the bill would increase budget deficits by $2.4 trillion over the period, compared with doing nothing, according to a new Congressional Budget Office estimate released Wednesday.<br>Just six months ago, Musk’s barrage of social-media posts triggered a mutiny of Republicans to kill a government spending bill right before Christmas, forcing hasty rewrites by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.). But that doesn’t appear to be happening in this case - at least not yet. Trump and GOP leaders have stuck with their plan, subject to some adjustments, while cognizant of the difficult math that means even a handful of Republican defectors in the House or Senate could sink the bill, given united Democratic opposition.<br>Johnson said Wednesday he was blindsided by Musk’s criticism. He said he spoke to Musk on Monday and walked him through the savings, policy prescriptions and tax revenue that Republicans argue the bill will bring in.  <br>“We had a great, very friendly, very fruitful conversation together,” Johnson said at his weekly press conference. “Twenty-four hours later, he does a 180 and he comes out against the bill. And it surprised me, frankly.” Johnson said he called Musk on Tuesday night and hoped to talk to him on Wednesday, but Musk hasn’t yet returned his call.<br>Johnson argued Musk is “flat wrong” in this case, adding that Trump is “not delighted that Elon did a 180.” But Johnson says he himself is “not upset by this.”<br>Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.), one of the two House Republicans who voted against the bill in the House last month, was pleased Musk was speaking out.<br>“I figured he would eventually get there,” said Massie, who noted the two haven’t spoken on the issue. “You don’t land rockets backwards or get cars to drive themselves by ignoring the people who are lying to you.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R75" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">76</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/4/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TUYỆT VỜI: BBC LÃNH CÁI GIŨA VÀO GIỮA TRÁN! <br>Tuần báo The Spectator (của Anh, xuất bản từ 1828) có bài tường thuật việc lãnh đạo BBC đả kích Donald Trump là bất lương.

What began as a public rebuke by Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, over a disputed report quickly developed into a broader interrogation of the BBC’s editorial assumptions and its long-standing handling of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict.<br>Jeremy Bowen, the BBC’s international editor, defended the Corporation and accused the Trump administration of dishonesty. Responding to Leavitt’s remarks, he said, “To be quite frank, the Trump administration does not have a good record when it comes to telling the truth itself. She’s making a political point, basically.” Bowen’s prominence makes his statements significant – but his remarks raise questions about the BBC’s impartiality. When a senior BBC figure implies that a sitting US administration routinely lies, that poses serious questions about impartiality – a core BBC requirement. Such assertions undermine the BBC’s claim to neutrality, particularly when the speaker has a documented history of misreporting.<br>Following the al-Ahli hospital explosion, Bowen wrongly claimed the building had been “flattened” by an Israeli air strike. In fact, the structure was intact, and the explosion was likely caused by a misfired Palestinian rocket. Bowen later admitted he was wrong, stating, “Oh yeah, well I got that wrong,” but added dismissively, “I don’t regret one thing in my reporting, because I think I was measured throughout.”<br>His past reporting has drawn formal complaints – upheld by the BBC Trust – for breaching standards of accuracy and impartiality. Notably, in 2009, the BBC Trust ruled against Bowen in two separate cases. One involved a 2007 online article in which Bowen described Zionism as having an “innate instinct to push out the frontier” and accused Israel of acting “in defiance of everyone’s interpretation of international law except its own.” The Trust found these statements breached impartiality guidelines and failed to offer alternative perspectives.<br>In another case, a 2008 radio report claimed that the US considered a particular Israeli settlement illegal. The Trust found the statement inadequately sourced, rendering it inaccurate. His continued prominence suggests the BBC does not take such breaches seriously. Even in instances where he has not been formally found to have violated BBC rules, viewers frequently lodge complaints about his coverage – particularly his tendency to present one-sided stories without sufficient balance or critical distance.<br>Bowen has also repeatedly asserted that Israel refuses media access to Gaza because it wants to conceal its actions. This is a valid theory – but it is far from the only plausible one. The explanation lacks balance. Israel has legitimate concerns: that journalists would be endangered, manipulated by Hamas or used as pawns in a propaganda war. In such a context, restricting access is a difficult strategic choice – less than ideal, but at least explicable by non-sinister, operational and humanitarian considerations.<br>At issue was the BBC’s coverage of an Israeli strike near an aid distribution centre in Rafah. Leavitt accused the BBC of accepting casualty numbers from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry without question and claimed the outlet had to retract its story after realizing the footage didn’t support it. The BBC denied the retraction, stating the article was merely updated throughout the day as more information emerged. But if the original version was substantially based on false or unverified premises, why wasn’t it removed entirely? The BBC’s insistence on incremental edits rather than full retractions speaks volumes about its reluctance to admit error.<br>This incident exemplifies a broader problem. The BBC routinely relies on casualty figures from a health ministry controlled by Hamas – a proscribed terrorist organization with a proven record of propaganda. These figures have frequently been shown by independent analysts to be exaggerated or implausible. The BBC’s justification – that it lacks access to Gaza and must report the figures it receives – is inadequate. Absence of access does not excuse the abandonment of journalistic scepticism.<br>Even when the facts are not misrepresented, key context is often missing. In a recent report from Beirut, the BBC’s Orla Guerin toured a hospital alleged by Israel to contain Hezbollah’s hidden assets. Guerin, presumably under Hezbollah’s restrictions, filmed standard medical rooms and repeated the hospital’s denials. She ignored specific coordinates provided by Israel. This is not reporting – it is the passive relay of a storyline shaped by a hostile actor, with a built in assumption that Israel is an undeniably dishonest actor which is deliberately trying to mislead. The reality is surely that its terrorist enemies are far more likely to be guilty of such deception and manipulation, yet all too often they go entirely unchallenged by the BBC’s coverage.<br>Such failures of curiosity and courage are not rare. They reflect a pattern: reflexive skepticism toward Israeli sources, deference to claims from Hamas or Hezbollah, and a resistance to correction. When BBC journalists reject White House criticism as political gamesmanship, yet engage in commentary themselves, they discredit the very neutrality they claim to uphold.<br>Leavitt’s remarks may have contained factual imprecision, but they spotlighted a deeper issue. The BBC has developed a habit of accepting claims from deeply compromised sources and defending its coverage with bureaucratic obstinacy. Its journalistic posture on Gaza is shaped less by objectivity than by inertia and institutional pride.<br>The BBC’s defensive posture in the face of this criticism is telling. Rather than acknowledging any shortcoming, it accused the White House of confusion and misrepresentation. Perhaps so – but what of its own record?<br>We should extend a vote of thanks to the United States and to the White House for once again drawing international attention to the UK’s major institutional failings – failings that so often go unchallenged within our own political and media landscape. When others shrink from the task, it is increasingly voices from the Trump administration that provoke the uncomfortable scrutiny our public institutions apparently need.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R76" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">77</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/4/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">GIÁO CHỦ HAM NÓI – NGHE MUỐN ÓI!<br>Trump kể lại hơn một giờ điện đàm với Putin, để cho biết Putin dọa sẽ trả đũa Ukraine sau khi bị chiến dịch “Mạng Nhện”.

The attacks, which killed seven and injured more than 100, took place over the weekend in the Russian regions of Kursk and Bryansk on the Ukrainian border. Ukraine hasn’t commented on the rail attacks and has previously denied targeting civilians.<br>“Who would negotiate with those who rely on terror? With terrorists?” Putin said at a government meeting. He accused Ukraine of seeking a truce merely to rearm and regroup for new attacks similar to those in Kursk and Bryansk.<br>Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky’s office, is in Washington meeting with lawmakers and Trump administration officials, including Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg.<br>Jon Green, a former senior national security adviser to Democratic lawmakers, said that Ukraine’s audacious drone operation exposed Russia’s defenses, making it harder for Putin to sell negotiations back home. “Putin looks weak at a time in which he’s trying to convey an image of strength, which could complicate prospects for a breakthrough in the continuing cease-fire negotiations, but provides President Trump with leverage he can use to push for an end to the war.”<br>Trump said that he and Putin also discussed blocking Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and that the Russian leader said he would be willing to get involved in the continuing conversations. Trump accused Iran of slow-walking progress toward a deal. <br>“President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion,” Trump said. Iran and the U.S. have held five rounds of nuclear talks so far, but the two sides have clashed over Washington’s insistence that Tehran give up uranium enrichment completely. <br>Western officials believe Iran wants to retain the option of producing a nuclear weapon. Iran says its nuclear work is peaceful and that trying to block it breaches Tehran’s principles of independence.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R77" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">78</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/4/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">QUY CHẾ ‘XÁC NHẬN’ CỦA ĐẠI HỌC COLUMBIA BỊ ĐẢ KÍCH!<br>Bản tin nóng hổi của WSJ: Chính quyền Trump đả kích việc Đại học Columbia được quy chế ‘xác nhận’ (accreditation – là được một tổ chức độc lập xác nhận có giá trị) vì Columbia phạm quá nhiều tội nên không đáng được xác nhận giá trị.<br>Chính quyền chưa ra phán quyết hủy bỏ quy chế đó, nhưng Columbia đã được cảnh cáo.

I really enjoyed that debate. So I&#39;m ranking Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper&#39;s book as a must-read for any Republican.<br>But the key takeaways from the book weren&#39;t sufficiently highlighted by the authors.<br>The three main lessons from &quot;Original Sin&quot; are:<br>1. Democrats are monumental liars.<br>2. They&#39;re still lying.<br>3. The Biden dead-enders, who fought like banshees to keep him as the candidate, would have been Machiavellian geniuses, not con artists - if only the media hadn&#39;t decided to dump the dementia patient.<br>As the book convincingly demonstrates, the entire Democratic Party lied ceaselessly about Biden, basically since the 2020 South Carolina primary. They lied in White House press briefings, in Signal messages, on social media. They lied in videos. They lied to the public, to the fact-checkers and to themselves.<br>They&#39;re still lying, but now they&#39;re lying about how, at the time, they really wanted to tell the truth. Or about how, in some evanescent moment, they secretly told someone the truth - and, no, you can&#39;t talk to that person.<br>Half of them are still lying about Biden&#39;s mental capacity.<br>The scale and intensity of the lying is mind-boggling.<br>Merely mentioning Biden&#39;s age - even by a New York Times reporter - would send White House staffers into a frenzy, unleashing a team of attack dogs on social media to &quot;shame journalists and create a disincentive structure for those curious about the president’s condition,” as the book puts it. (My first surprise. I did not know it was possible to shame journalists.)<br>When one of the book&#39;s authors - a reporter, i.e. a liberal - accurately wrote in Axios in early 2024 that Biden aides found it “difficult to schedule public or private events with the president in the morning, in the evening or on weekends,” the White House quickly denounced him as a &quot;peddler of fake news.”<br>Every Hollywood trick in the book was deployed by the Biden campaign simply to produce a decent short video. First, they cut the videos from five minutes to two. They used two cameras to make the jump-cuts less obvious, so that they could cut and paste any short bursts of coherence from the president to create the semblance of an actual sentence. They slowed videos of him walking to make his tortoiselike gait less obvious.<br>It didn&#39;t work. In September 2023, the White House sent a pre-recorded message from Biden to a naturalization ceremony in Gloucester, Massachusetts. But the video was from 2021. (It might have been from 1821 on close inspection.)<br>They brought in Hollywood heavyweights, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg, to coach Biden and work on his lighting and microphone before any public appearances.<br>They lied about &quot;cheap fakes&quot; whenever any actual video of the president slipped into public view.<br>Now that it&#39;s over, Democrats are lying up a storm about how they almost told the truth.<br>Here are a couple:<br>&quot;[After the debate, one] donor arrived determined to go up to Biden and plead with him to drop out but was talked out of it at the last second.”<br>“[Chief of Staff] Jeff Zients kept it to himself, but after the debate, he thought that the president should drop out.”<br>I&#39;m in awe of their balls-to-the-walls bravery.<br>Others keep insisting that Biden&#39;s mind was FINE - it was just a problem of his &quot;communication skills.&quot; Not to be dense, but if he couldn&#39;t &quot;communicate,&quot; how do we know what he was thinking? Telepathy?<br>But the book&#39;s authors were wildly impressed with the &quot;communication&quot; argument, citing it dozens of times.<br>Here are a few:<br>- “Biden on a day-in, day-out basis could certainly make decisions ... [complicated by] his ability to communicate.”<br>- “House Democrats would see in the president’s flawed presentation evidence of perhaps some communicative, if not cognitive, slippage.”<br>- [After a major international gaffe], “&#39;He just struggles to communicate nuance,&#39; one senior White House official told us. &#39;First, he’s not a great communicator ...&#39;”<br>- “&#39;The president’s decisions were always solid and deeply considered,&#39; [said a former senior administration official]. &#39;But the second part of that - communicating those decisions - that was never easy for him throughout his presidency.”<br>- “[Some staffers] believed that the president’s decision-making was solid but also acknowledged that, yes, his communications were a problem.”<br>- Chris Hayes weighed in: “I think Joe Biden has a very good record on making decisions. And I think he is a very poor communicator right now.”<br>- “As for ... Biden’s ability to communicate his sound decisions, those closest to [him] ... saw these abilities, or lack thereof, as separate from his core capacity.”<br>- “He had ... a stark inability to communicate ... Yet those same critics continued to the end to attest to his ability to make sound decisions.”<br>How do I &quot;communicate&quot; this? It&#39;s completely insane. Did they bring a crystal ball to Cabinet meetings? You know who else makes great decisions but is totally unable to articulate them? A statue of Abraham Lincoln.<br>The authors themselves pitch the &quot;communication&quot; argument, saying: “Biden was weak throughout [the debate]. Not necessarily on the substance but on his ability to communicate.”<br>Again, if he couldn&#39;t communicate, how do they know he was good on &quot;substance&quot;?<br>For example, what precisely did Biden mean when he responded to Donald Trump&#39;s claim that Democrats support abortion in the ninth month of pregnancy by saying, inter alia:<br>&quot;[And] this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it. We’re in a state where in six weeks you don’t even know whether you’re pregnant or not, but you cannot see a doctor, have your -- and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help.&quot;<br>You can&#39;t see a doctor? What?<br>&quot;Look, there’s so many young women who have been - including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by - by - by an immigrant coming in and (inaudible) talk about that. ...&quot;<br>Was he proposing to abort illegals? That&#39;s a little aggressive, even for me, but OK.<br>Most weirdly, the authors themselves brush off Biden&#39;s Hiroshima of a debate by claiming that some critics will &quot;sniff at the superficialities of such matters.&quot; Really? Name one.<br>When the entire Times editorial board calls for the Democratic presidential nominee to withdraw before the cameras are turned off, I&#39;m pretty sure the problem with his debate performance wasn&#39;t merely cosmetic.<br>Finally, while Biden&#39;s inner circle, or &quot;the Politburo,&quot; come across as power-mad nitwits in the book, they would have been studs if the Times editorial board had thought Biden still had a chance. But according to the book, post-debate polls gave Biden between a 1% and 5% shot at winning. (Must&#39;ve been his makeup, you superficial dolts.)<br>In a truth-from-the-mouths-of-babies moment, earlier in 2024, CNN&#39;s MJ Lee had asked Biden about polls showing Americans were worried about his age.<br>Biden: “That is your judgment.”<br>Lee: “This is according to public polling.”<br>Biden: “That is not the judgment of the press.&quot;<br>For a Democrat, that&#39;s all that matters. Contrary to popular belief, the media is not the handmaiden of the Democratic Party; the Democratic Party is the handmaiden of the media. They are the ones calling the shots, but the media can’t run the country unless Democrats are in power. So their No. 1 objective is to ensure that Democrats win elections.<br>Had Times editors believed Biden could win, then instead of that paper finally admitting, after four years of lying about it, that Trump never instructed people to inject bleach, they would have been calling the entire debate a &quot;cheap fake.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R79" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">80</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/4/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">VÌ SAO ĐẠO CÔNG GIÁO LẠI ĂN KHÁCH TRONG GIỚI TRẺ<br>Bài phân tách rất hay của Madeleine Kearns trên The Free Press hôm nay cho thấy một trào lưu mới, không chỉ tại Hoa Kỳ mà còn ở các nước Âu Châu…<br>https://www.thefp.com/p/meet-americas-newest-catholics<br>How Catholicism Got Cool<br>Americans are starved of beauty, meaning, purpose, and community. The Church of Rome offers all these things, but so do other religions. So: Why Catholicism? (Jeffrey Bruno for The Free Press)<br>Young Americans and people around the world are flocking to the Catholic Church. The Free Press spoke to them to find out why.<br>(By Madeleine Kearns - The Free Press - 06.04.25 - The Big Read)<br>Listen to Article<br>14 mins<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>The candlelit church in Greenwich Village was packed. After months of study and preparation, 19 adults sat at the front, dressed in white, nervously awaiting their turn at the baptismal font. One by one, they stepped forward. After anointing them with chrism (holy oil), the priest poured water over their heads, baptizing them into the Catholic Church in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<br>“It was almost as if the veil between heaven and earth had been lifted,” said Jane, one of the adults baptized into the Church that day. She left feeling “more receptive to the supernatural.”<br>That was Easter Sunday 2025, just over a month ago. And what happened in Greenwich Village happened across America. There was a boom in adult baptisms.<br>Earlier this year, The Pillar reported a surge in the numbers of aspiring Catholics registering to join the church at Easter. The Diocese of Lansing in Michigan reported a 30 percent spike from the previous year, 633 converts, which is the highest they’ve seen in over a decade. Father Ryan Kaup, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Catholic center, baptized 20 students alone - “the highest we’ve ever had” - and gave rites of initiation to an additional 50 who were coming into the church from other Christian denominations.<br>And now, of course, we have an American pope, Leo XIV, who church leaders hope will turbocharge the country’s Catholic boom.<br>America is not alone. The Catholic boom is also happening in France - which saw a 45 percent increase in the number of adult baptisms this year - and in England - where, due to a surge in Mass attendance, Catholics are on track to outnumber Anglicans for the first time since the Church of England was born.<br>Why are so many adults in the once-secularized West seeking to be baptized into the Catholic Church? I’ve been reporting on the rise in religiosity for a while now, and have heard many theories: Modern Americans are starved of beauty, meaning, purpose, and community. The Church of Rome offers all these things, but so do other religions. So: Why Catholicism?<br>“In an age of instability, people are attracted to ancient traditions; in an age of therapy-speak, there’s something appealing about the tough demands of Catholic doctrine,” Dan Hitchens, a former Catholic Herald editor, told me. “Catholicism also has a visual and aesthetic heritage which has translated well into online culture. Catholics have turned out to be surprisingly good at using the internet to evangelize.”<br>To find out more, I tracked down a handful of the several thousand or so American adults who were baptized this past Easter, and spoke to those who hadn’t been raised Catholic, to find out why the religion appealed. Most of them were in their 20s, which makes sense: The Catholic boom is especially notable among Gen Z. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that the percentage of Gen Zers identifying as Catholic jumped from 15 percent to 21 percent from 2022 and 2023.<br>“In an age of instability, people are attracted to ancient traditions; in an age of therapy-speak, there’s something appealing about the tough demands of Catholic doctrine,” said Dan Hitchens. (Nic Antaya for The Free Press)<br>Like any convert, everyone I spoke to had very personal reasons for joining the Catholic Church, but there was one thing they all agreed on: The religion fulfilled their yearning for transcendence better than anything else.<br>Jane, 22, who preferred to be referred to by her middle name, grew up in northern Virginia (and later Arkansas) without a religion. But she said she “always liked the aesthetic elements of Catholicism.”<br>Depictions of the religion in old movies - like the baptism sequence in The Godfather - had intrigued her as a child, and later, as a teenager, she “loved the architecture and the stained glass” of old churches, “and how much detail and symbolism was there.”<br>It’s easy to forget, in an age of efficiency and technology, that human beings need beauty and awe. On May 14, while addressing leaders of the Eastern Christian churches, the new pope spoke of the “great need to recover the sense of mystery” at Catholic Mass, which engages “the human person in his or her entirety. . . and evokes a sense of wonder.”<br>For many new Catholics, this means the “smells and bells” of traditionalism, which allows worshippers to feel the higher truth of religion through their senses, rather than just grapple with it on an intellectual level. For Jane, an arresting work of art, or a beautiful piece of music, “shows how present God is in our lives to inspire us.”<br>Easter Vigil at St. Joseph Church (Jeffrey Bruno for The Free Press)<br>Her first exposure to Mass came as a music major at Penn State, where she studied - and loved - the settings of the Requiem Mass, by Mozart and Verdi. Then she learned about Gregorian chant, which she connected with on a spiritual level. “It was just hearing how simple and exposed it was.”<br>These days, it’s not unusual for an interest in the divine to be piqued by aesthetics. Bishop Robert Barron, a popular Catholic media personality, has said that in the individualistic, materialistic world of modern America - a world where talking about morality is passé and theology is dull - “the best way to evangelize” is to start with what’s beautiful about Catholicism. Then you move to what’s good, then to what’s true. In other words, for many people, it is more effective to begin by appealing to their eyes or their ears than their hearts or minds.<br>But eventually, Jane found solace in Catholicism. Toward the end of her time as an undergraduate, she was feeling anxious about her grad-school applications, and remembers feeling mysteriously drawn to watching a livestream of Mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City. She told me she can’t explain where the feeling came from. “I’d been to St. Patrick’s once, five years ago, and I’d never been on their website. I’d never watched Mass before,” she said. “But I went and googled it.”<br>Is this what divine intervention looks like, in the internet age?<br>Jane watched the whole Mass, and she told me, “I just immediately felt, like, this sense of peace.”<br>Soon enough, she started visiting the campus chapel to pray. Beginning to wonder if she’d ever get into grad school, she said to God: “Show me what I’m supposed to be doing.” Four hours later, she learned she’d been accepted into New York University. “I was like, My prayers were answered.”<br>Jane was baptized eight months later, this past Easter Sunday, at St. Joseph’s church in Manhattan.<br>If America’s Catholic boom is being driven by young people, it’s being driven particularly by young men, who are now more religious than young women. Father Charles Gallagher, the pastor at Immaculate Conception in D.C., told me that of the seven new Catholics he baptized this year, six were men. His church, he believes, is representative.<br>Father Gallagher told me that young men are “looking for answers” to questions such as, “How do I become a better leader? Or how do I take control of my life? Or how do I overcome my addiction? Or how can I get girls to say ‘yes’ to me when I ask them out on dates?”<br>Often, they start by finding superficial answers online, where male influencers like Andrew Tate preach that modern America has demonized men. But Father Gallagher told me that though the young men he encounters might find themselves attracted to a few of the talking points of the “manosphere,” they “naturally sense that some of these famous influencers are kind of false prophets.”<br>And, when they do, “They’re led to Christianity. They’re led to Catholicism.”<br>Many Catholic influencers specifically aim to reach the lost boys of Gen Z. If you watch Jordan Peterson videos on YouTube, eventually the algorithm will likely present you with adjacent and more explicitly Catholic figures like Father Mike Schmitz, the charismatic priest of The Bible in a Year fame, or Bishop Barron of Word on Fire. These influencers might speak about the struggles young men face, but they also speak about hope and sacrifice and a clear path to a better way of being.<br>Darnell, 21, a student at Oakland University in Michigan who was baptized this Easter, told me he likes the fact that Catholicism doesn’t “shame you for being a man.” He believes young men feel inspired to become Catholic in a similar way that they might join the military. “It’s that brotherhood among other brothers of Christ,” he said, “along with that discipline that I believe is bringing so many young men to Catholicism.”<br>Darnell Sumpter Jr., at St. John Fisher University Parish in Auburn Hills, Michigan. He was baptized this April, the day before Easter. (Nic Antaya for The Free Press)<br>Darnell grew up in Southfield, Michigan, in a family that was “Christian by name only,” but in his late teens he began yearning for “a more traditional, closer relationship with God.” At college, he accompanied his girlfriend, a nondenominational Christian, to her church, but he thought the service seemed more focused on entertainment than worship. “It’s more like a concert than being there for God, in my opinion.”<br>He began following an Orthodox Christian bishop on YouTube, and was considering converting to that tradition. But during the first week of the fall semester, he was stopped on the street by a campus missionary, Brendan, who invited him to join the school’s Catholic club. “I like to say the Catholics got me first,” Darnell told me. (When Darnell decided to get baptized this past Easter, Brendan acted as his sponsor, or godfather.)<br>Though Jane was drawn to the Catholic tradition by the music, Darnell was attracted by the silence. The Catholic Church places an emphasis on contemplation. “From the very first Mass I went to, you walk in, you’re quiet,” said Darnell.<br>He also liked the levels of devotion in Catholicism. “You give adoration to God.” At a conference for Catholic college students in Salt Lake City, where he met dozens of other traditionally minded Christians, the schedule was jam-packed. “We had Mass every day, and at 6 a.m. was a prayer of the Rosary,” Darnell said, before describing the Eucharist:<br>“I&#39;ll never forget when one of the priests was walking up and down the aisles, and it’s a huge room. . . and just the people that were crying and bowing, and the atmosphere was amazing.<br>“That’s when I knew: Okay, this is exactly what I was searching for.”<br>Father Gallagher also thinks the intensity is part of the appeal. “Men in their mid-20s to early 30s want something they can go all-in on,” he told me, “and they see that in Catholicism.”<br>Many of the young new Catholics I spoke to said they like the intimacy of Catholicism, as well as the intensity. Yuichiro, 28, grew up in a Shinto-Buddhist household in New York City; his parents saw religious traditions more as a “cultural custom” than a belief system, and in Shinto-Buddhism, he said, God was “a pretty distant figure.”<br>Having been baptized a Catholic on Easter Sunday, Yuichiro told me the thing he likes about the Church is the “radical nearness” of Jesus Christ: “God literally was born as a man and walked on this earth, and has experienced all the hardships that we humans have experienced.”<br>This latter point became important for Yuichiro when he had an agonizing experience in high school. A close friend had a psychotic episode and stabbed him three times, he told me. Yuichiro had been trying to calm him down. His vital organs were unscathed, but he required stitches, and the experience left him deeply confused.<br>“I really struggled to explain why that happened,” he said. He was only trying to be a good friend, and his friend hadn’t meant any harm - he just wasn’t well. “Why did two good people trying to do good things end up causing such an evil outcome? That was a question I’ve always had.”<br>Years later, in Catholicism’s explanation of a suffering God - who experienced human pain himself in crucifixion - Yuichiro found comfort. God understood.<br>Darnell pictured at a Bible study group meeting at St. John Fisher University Parish in Auburn Hills, Michigan. (Nic Antaya for The Free Press)<br>Yuichiro first went to Mass at the invitation of a Catholic girl he dated in high school, and he kept going with another Catholic woman he had dated in college. But there was a sense of obligation: Both girlfriends wanted a partner who would go to church with them.<br>Neither relationship worked out, but they planted the seeds of faith that were later nurtured by the Catholic friends Yuichiro made as a young professional working in D.C. “They took me to church,” he said - but there was no sense of obligation. “They were always going to be my friends, whether I became Catholic or not.”<br>In some ways, Yuichiro said, his choice of religion “just comes down to the people I was surrounded by,” but then he added a caveat. He did visit the churches of other denominations, with Protestant friends - and they didn’t appeal to him in the same way.<br>For some in D.C., where Yuichiro is busy working as a Capitol Hill staffer, Catholicism has a political appeal. Ross Douthat, New York Times columnist and author of Believe: Why Everyone Should Be Religious, told me that “Roman Catholicism is increasingly coded as the natural option for American believers who are highly educated or would-be elites, playing the role that used to be played by, say, Episcopalianism or Presbyterianism.<br>“What was once the ultimate outsider’s faith now seems like a natural home for would-be insiders,” said Douthat.<br>But for Yuichiro at least, the appeal of Catholicism was not ideological. “Something that really drew me to Catholicism was its much more dedicated focus on God.”<br>Like the other men I spoke to, he wanted to devote himself to God and to commit to his faith. It wasn’t just about spending time with other people. “I wanted to go to church not because I wanted a community. I had plenty of friends,” he said. “I wanted God.”<br>And, in Catholicism, more so than in any other traditions Yuichiro was acquainted with, “I think that immediacy with God, I really felt that.”<br>“That’s just something that was very unique.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R80" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">81</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/4/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">“ALL THINGS” TUẦN NÀY CỦA KIMBERLEY STRASSEL<br>Đây là tiết mục điểm tin trong tuần của Kim Strassel, với văn phong độc đáo:<br>https://allthingswithkimstrassel.cmail19.com/.../d-e.../<br>All Things<br>A newsy analysis of the workings of D.C. (and beyond), providing the inside track on both the overhyped and overlooked events of the week.<br>Trump’s Cautious Clippers<br>The White House on Tuesday (finally) sent Congress a “rescission” package, asking members to eliminate $9.4 billion in previously approved spending. Presidents rarely use rescission, and Congress is rarely excited to act on the requests. So while conservatives are thrilled to see Donald Trump moving to revive the powerful tool, they are also disappointed by the meager requests in this package - especially in light of blowout spending in Joe Biden’s term, and the Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to identify waste. A guide to what rescission is, and what the White House is doing:<br>* To impound, or not to impound: In contrast to budget reconciliations or appropriations packages - which modify spending going forward - the rescission power allows presidents to prod Congress to cancel already approved funds. The power is the product of a spending fight between Richard Nixon and Congress, which ended with the Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Congress used the law to reinforce its claim that presidents don’t have the unilateral power to refuse to spend (impound) money that Congress appropriates. But the law also threw presidents a bone: rescission. The executive can request Congress cancel specific appropriations, and Congress has 45 days to act (or not) on that request. Rescission votes are not subject to the filibuster, so they may be approved in the Senate with just 51 votes.<br>* A neglected power: Modern presidents and Congresses generally love to spend, so rescission has nearly disappeared as a tool. The last president to use it with any regularity was Bill Clinton, who sent Congress a rescission package every year he was in office (Congress approved about half the value of what he requested). Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Biden never touched the tool. Trump sent Congress a rescission package in 2018 that passed the House before the Senate rejected it. He sent another in early 2021, which was ignored by incoming Democrats.<br>* The (puny) ask: Elon Musk recently criticized the GOP’s “massive spending” reconciliation bill, which he says “undermines” the savings DOGE has found. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller responded that Musk was wrong to expect reconciliation to lock in DOGE work, saying that the proper tool was rescission. So where are the lock-ins? DOGE says it has identified some $180 billion in savings, though Congress needs to approve many of the grant cancellations and other clawbacks. Yet the White House rescissions request is for a mere $9.4 billion - out of annual discretionary spending of $1.6 trillion. This (supposedly) cost-cutting president is in possession of a tool and a (supposedly) cost-cutting GOP Congress that would allow him to dramatically cut the largesse of his predecessor. So why the timidity?<br>* The targets: The president is requesting $1.1 billion in cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which underwrites NPR and PBS. He’s also asking for $8.3 billion in cuts to foreign-aid grants, many identified as part of DOGE’s review of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The important point: These cuts are almost universally supported among Republicans, unlike DOGE’s proposed cuts to more politically sensitive areas, like education, health or science. The White House remembers the sting of 2018, when the Senate rejected its rescissions package. This time it is coordinating with congressional leaders and putting forward nothing more than the lowest-hanging fruit. The goal: A quick political win with a successful rescission vote. Speaker Mike Johnson plans for the House to hold a vote next week.<br>* What’s next: Still, the bill might be a test. Office of Budget and Management Director Russell Vought on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday said the package was only “the first of many rescissions bills” - and provided Congress a little warning. He said the White House is still considering teeing up a Supreme Court fight over whether the president has a unilateral power to refuse to spend congressionally appropriated funds (impoundment authority). He also held out the possibility of Trump using what’s called a “pocket rescission” - when a president sends a rescission request to Congress just prior to the end of the fiscal year, essentially getting its cuts by running out the clock. Proponents argue a pocket rescission is a power granted the president through a quirk in that 1974 budget law, though the move might also draw litigation. Vought’s message to Congress: “It’s a provision that has been rarely used, but it’s there. And we intend to use all of these tools. We want Congress to pass it where it’s necessary; we also have executive tools…. But it’s very important to pass this bill, and see whether there is a will in both the House and Senate to secure the votes for it.”<br>The White House senses rising frustration among Congress’s fiscal conservatives over how little has been done to tackle Washington’s unsustainable deficits. Sens. Ron Johnson, Mike Lee, Rick Scott and Rand Paul continue to demand far greater rollbacks of the Biden spending agenda as part of the reconciliation process, and are backed by House conservatives. The White House’s sudden interest in jumpstarting rescissions (it had initially suggested a package would arrive to Congress by May) may be an effort to tamp down a revolt. But it will need to convince the spending reformers that it is serious about doubling down on rescission, as this package amounts to little.<br>About That ‘One’ Anti-Catholic FBI Memo<br>One result of the FBI’s long string of scandals is that lawmakers lost trust in its promises that all was well. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley on Tuesday provided yet more evidence that the FBI played fast and loose with Congress and the public on the issue of its now-infamous memo targeting some traditionalist Catholics as “violent extremists.”<br>The FBI’s Richmond field office in January 2023 issued a report entitled “Interest of Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists in Radical-Traditionalist Catholic Ideology Almost Certainly Presents New Mitigation Opportunities.” The report obnoxiously claimed that traditionalist Catholics could be characterized by their love of the Latin mass, dislike of modern popes, and “frequent adherence to anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ, and white supremacist ideology.” The document also relied on reporting from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a discredited progressive group. The memo was quickly divulged by a whistleblower, and the bureau yanked it. Mr. Wray then testified he’d been “aghast” when he learned about it, but reassured: “It was a product by one field office, which of course we have scores and scores of these products, and when we found out about it, we took action.”<br>House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan later that year provided evidence that Richmond had in fact worked with other bureaus in compiling its report. Mr. Grassley now says that the Richmond memo was distributed to more than 1,000 FBI employees across the country before it was divulged and pulled down, and that it was viewed by numerous FBI intelligence analysts in more than a dozen field offices. Mr. Grassley reports that Richmond “only received positive” feedback on the memo - nothing negative. A deeper search of FBI files meanwhile turned up more than 13 documents (and five attachments) with the term “radical traditionalist Catholic.” In a letter to new FBI Director Kash Patel, the senator demands access to those reports.<br>The whistleblower disclosure of the memo caused immediate outrage, and quickly shut down the FBI’s nascent Catholic targeting. But the Grassley reveal shows that the FBI’s interest in equating religious dedication with dangerous extremism was far more widespread than the bureau admitted, and had the potential to grow into an abusive operation. Patel continues to face a real job in reestablishing trust.<br>Splashing in the Byrd Bath<br>You might think all the action right now in the Republican reconciliation process involves GOP negotiations. Not quite. The most important (and feared) actor in this drama in the coming weeks will be Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough. Her job it is to decide which, if any, provisions in the GOP bill violate the rules of reconciliation, in particular to get rid of those that are “extraneous” to budgetary questions. Spare a thought for the poor parliamentarian, who is already being lobbied to death. This is Democrats’ one and only shot to derail pieces of the GOP bill, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer recently bragged that his committees “have been working overtime” to build the cases they bring to her. Republicans, for their part have been talking to MacDonough since the beginning of the year in an effort to avoid complications.<br>Perhaps the most important fight is over accounting, and whether Republicans will be allowed to count an extension of the Trump tax cuts as exactly that - an extension - versus a new “cost.” Another consequential fight is the GOP effort to get sign-off on the Reins act, which would give Congress a role in approving costly regulations.<br>Then comes the category of hardest lifts (for Republicans). Those include another attempt to use reconciliation to defund Planned Parenthood (MacDonough shut down a similar effort in 2017); a provision attempting to rein in the judicial power to enforce contempt citations; and a temporary bar on states implementing artificial-intelligence regulations. A final category is provisions that Democrats loathe - and are talking nonstop about to the press - but that Republicans are more likely than not to prevail on. They include stopping Medicaid payments for transgender-related treatments; immigration fees; the end of taxes on certain firearm parts; and certain permitting rules for energy projects.<br>Yet none of this is over until its over. An odd feature of the Byrd process is that the “rules” are more guidelines, and final calls often rest in nuance, details and how persuasive the argument. Democrats are coming armed with past examples, legal arguments and expert testimony backing their cases; Republicans are presenting not just arguments on the other side, but proposed modifications that might get provisions over the finish line. Think of the Senate right now not as a legislative chamber, but as a high-stakes debating tournament.<br>BY THE NUMBERS:<br>[13] Percentage of non-LGBTQ Americans who think all or most companies that support Pride Month do so out of a “genuine desire to celebrate LGBTQ people,” according to new research from Pew Research Center.<br>[23] U.S. senators on the Agriculture Committee, which on Tuesday used a voice vote to reallow whole and 2% milk back into school lunches.

There’s no doubt about that. There’s always going to be a trade-off. And the key is to make the trade-off based on principles. And it’s OK, as I say in the book, to give up a little inessential liberty to gain a lot of security but not to give up basic liberties to gain a small amount of security. We do too much of the latter and not enough of the former. And so what I’ve tried to do is create a jurisprudence which weighs when it’s proper and when it’s not proper to take preventive actions and erring always on the side of liberty rather than security but giving weight to security.”<br>O.J. Simpson 9<br>Dershowitz in court with one of his most (in)famous clients: O.J Simpson.<br>It’s a colossal and contentious topic. “I have been writing and teaching about ‘the preventive state’ (a phrase I coined during my teaching in the 1960s) over my entire career,” Dershowitz writes.<br>“So finally, after all these years, at 86 I decided to put it all together into one book,” he tells The Post. That’s after challenging others to do it at the end of a 2008 book.<br>“I wasn’t ready. I didn’t have the answer. I had the problem, but I didn’t have the solution,” he explains. “I really had to have the time to work through, and I finally created a jurisprudence. Now I’ve figured out how to solve these problems.”<br>And these problems constantly arise.<br>“Why do we deport people? To prevent them from committing crimes. Why are we thinking about bombing Iran? To prevent them from developing a nuclear weapon. Why did we require people to wear masks and be inoculated during COVID? To prevent it from spreading. Why do we lock people up pending trial? To prevent them from fleeing or committing crimes. So prevention runs through our legal system, but there’s no systematic attempt to either define it or create a jurisprudence. That’s what I’ve done.”<br>Alan Dershowitz 9<br>Dershowitz points to a letter George Washington signed - for which Alexander Hamilton wrote the text.

It’s the most important book I’ve ever written. It’ll be probably the least recognized because of the cancellation issue. But if I’m going to be remembered 50 years from now, it’s going to be because of this book,” he says. “I was the first academic to basically discover prevention and start writing about it, 60 years ago, and now I’m the first academic to write a major whole book on this.”<br>That’s a bold statement from someone whose work has created a seemingly unceasing supply of memorable moments.<br>His bestselling 1985 book “Reversal of Fortune” was turned into a 1990 film that earned Jeremy Irons an Oscar for his portrayal of Dershowitz’s client Claus von Bülow, who was acquitted on appeal of attempting to murder his wife, Sunny, played by Glenn Close.<br>Dersh approves Ron Silver’s portrayal of him - mostly. “He was very, very, very good.

He used to confer with me about cases,” he reveals.<br>“My former students, people like Jamie Raskin, they used to always confer with me, but not since I defended Donald Trump. Martha’s Vineyard, people stopped talking to me. Wouldn’t allow me to speak in the library. Wouldn’t allow me to speak at the Jewish center. The synagogue in Martha’s Vineyard wouldn’t allow me to speak there about Israel or anything else. So what do you think we did? We fought back. We founded our own synagogue on Martha’s Vineyard” - “which now has more people going than the synagogue that banned me.”<br>He continues, “Barack Obama invited me to the White House, invited me to the Oval Office, invited me on Martha’s Vineyard. Well, now he won’t.”<br>Personal friends like comedian Larry David also quit speaking to him after the Trump defense.<br>Alan Dershowitz 9<br>Dershowitz’s Manhattan apartment is filled with history and art. Stephen Yang<br>Is he certain it’s all about the liberal bête noire now occupying the Oval Office? Dershowitz worked on the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s first criminal case over victimizing underage girls - and one, Virginia Giuffre, claimed the lawyer abused her. She eventually walked back that claim, which he wrote about in The Post.<br>“It all started before Jeffrey Epstein. It started with Trump. And the Jeffrey Epstein thing, when it happened, never had any effect on me, on Martha’s Vineyard, especially now that I’ve been, of course, exonerated,” he says.<br>Dershowitz’s banishment for defending a president from impeachment comes after a lifetime of defending unpopular clients - including accused murderers.<br>“O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bülow, Leona Helmsley, you name it. I defended Nazis marching through Skokie,” he says.<br>“And that’s never been a problem. I defended Bill Clinton. I defended Ted Kennedy for driving a car off the bridge, and nobody objected to that. And that was the Vineyard. That was the first time I ever set foot on Martha’s Vineyard. I’ll tell you a wonderful story about that.”<br>He was seated next to Ted’s niece Caroline at a dinner party a few years ago.<br>“Caroline Kennedy looks at me when I sit down and says, ‘I’m polite, so I’m not going to get up and leave, but if I knew that you had been invited, I never would have come to this dinner party. This was right after I defended Trump. So I said to her, ‘Is this because I defended Trump?’ She said, ‘Absolutely.’ I said, ‘But I defended Ted Kennedy, your uncle. Did you object to that?’ And she walked away,” he recalls. “I’ve had 18 murder cases, and I’ve won 15 of the 18 murder cases. Not all of them have been innocent, I can tell you that right now, not all of them have been innocent. And nobody objected. It was only Donald.”<br>Alan Dershowitz 9<br>Dershowitz has the American presidents’ signatures - in a restroom. Stephen Yang<br>Yet Dershowitz’s influence cannot be denied - besides the signal lawsuits, his students have been making their own history in powerful positions, from NYPD commissioner (Jessica Tisch) to secretary of state (Mike Pompeo).<br>Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan would sit next to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin in Cambridge. “They flirted with each other all the time,” Dersh reveals. “They were too cute with each other in class.”<br>The Harvard professor emeritus says, “I love teaching, but when I turned 75 I decided I want a new career. I figured at that time I have 10 good years left - it’s been 11 so far - I wanted to do something different. And so I am.”<br>What is that new career?<br>“Provocateur. I love that word,” he responds.<br>He adds he’s a “meritocratic egalitarian, constitutional libertarian and constructive contrarian” - and even a “classical liberal.”<br>Alan Dershowitz 9<br>Dershowitz’s new book is the culmination of the legendary legal mind’s 60-year career. Stephen Yang<br>His insights in “The Preventive State” aren’t limited to law; the book is filled with economics, philosophy and politics too - just like his apartment.<br>He has an early copy Congress made of the Declaration of Independence, with all the original signers and letters by Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstein, John Stuart Mill and many others.<br>“This is my most valuable letter. It’s signed by George Washington. It’s written to the troops in the middle of the Revolutionary War. But the text was not written by George Washington. It was written by his obscure secretary named Alexander Hamilton,” he chuckles.<br>“It talks about how all soldiers have to get inoculated against smallpox.”<br>America has been a preventive state since the beginning.<br>“Just good stuff,” the genial writer concludes after proudly showing part of his collection. “It inspires me every day.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R82" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">83</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/4/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TỐI CAO PHÁP VIỆN THỤ LÝ HỒ SƠ ĐẾM PHIẾU SAU NGÀY BẦU CỬ!<br>Sharyl Attkisson cho chúng ta biết cái tin rất đặc biệt này:<br>https://sharylattkisson.com/.../watchdog-ballot-counting.../<br>Watchdog: Ballot counting after Election Day heads to Supreme Court<br>By Sharyl Attkisson | June 4, 2025<br>The following is from Judicial Watch.<br>Judicial Watch announced that the Supreme Court of the United States has agreed to hear its appeal in a case filed on behalf of Congressman Mike Bost and two presidential electors, challenging an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days after Election Day - despite federal law setting a uniform election date.<br>The case, Rep.Michael J. Bost, Laura Pollastrini, and Susan Sweeney v. The Illinois State Board of Elections and Bernadette Matthews (No. 1:22-cv-02754, 23-2644, 24-568), was previously dismissed by lower courts, which ruled Bost lacked standing to sue.<br>“It is an injustice that the courts would deny a federal candidate the ability to challenge an election provision that could lead to illegal votes being cast and counted for two weeks AFTER Election Day,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The Supreme Court’s decision to hear this case is a critical opportunity to uphold federal law, protect voter rights, and ensure election integrity. Illinois’ 14-day extension of Election Day thwarts federal law, violates the civil rights of voters, and invites fraud.”<br>Federal law defines Election Day as the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of every even-numbered year. The complaint notes:<br>    “Despite Congress’ clear statement regarding a single national Election Day, Illinois has expanded Election Day by extending by 14 days the date for receipt and counting of vote-by-mail ballots.”<br>Illinois law permits counting mail-in ballots received after polls close on Election Day - including ballots without postmarks - so long as they are dated on or before Election Day. Judicial Watch argues this undermines federal election standards and injures candidates affected by delayed vote counting.<br>In its petition to the Supreme Court, Judicial Watch stated:<br>    “For over 130 years, this Court has heard claims brought by federal candidates challenging state time, place, or manner regulations affecting their federal elections. Until recently, it was axiomatic that candidates had standing to challenge these regulations. Indeed, ‘it’s hard to imagine anyone who has a more particularized injury than the candidate has.’ … That is because a candidate who ‘pours money and sweat into a campaign, who spends time away from her job and family to traverse the campaign trail, and who puts her name on a ballot has an undeniably different - and more particularized - interest in the lawfulness of the election’ than ‘some random voter.’”<br>    “Petitioners are a sitting multi-term Congressman and two federal electors. They challenged an Illinois law … that allows absentee ballots to be received and counted after the day specified in federal statutes for holding federal elections … They contend that Illinois’ Receipt Deadline is preempted by the federal Election Day statutes.”<br>    “This petition presents an opportunity for the Court to provide lower courts and litigants much needed guidance on candidate standing, outside of the high-stakes, emergency, post-election litigation where these issues commonly arise.”<br>Judicial Watch attorneys Robert Popper and Christine Svenson are leading the case. Popper previously served in the Justice Dept.’s Civil Rights Division overseeing voting rights enforcement.<br>As part of its broader election integrity work, Judicial Watch has filed similar lawsuits challenging post-Election Day ballot counting in states including Mississippi and California, and has taken legal action to clean up voter rolls in Illinois, Oregon, and several other jurisdictions under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). The group says these efforts have led to the removal of over five million ineligible names from voter rolls nationwide.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R83" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">84</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/4/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">NIALL FERGUSON PHÊ PHÁN CHÁNH SÁCH ĐỐI NGOẠI CỦA TRUMP<br>Bài rất hay, nhưng Ferguson quá chậm!...<br>https://www.thefp.com/p/niall-ferguson-trumps-foreign-policy<br>Niall Ferguson: Trump’s Foreign Policy? Reality TV Politik<br>‘Great television,’ as Trump described the shouting match with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian leader, is not the best approach to the task of ending Russia’s war against Ukraine. (Saul Loeb via Getty Images)<br>Making peace is harder than buying skyscrapers. The president is learning this the painful way in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.<br>(By Niall Ferguson - The Free Press - 06.02.25 - U.S. Politics)<br>Listen to Article<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>There’s realpolitik. And then there’s reality TV politik. There’s foreign policy realism, of the kind associated with Henry Kissinger. And then there’s Donald Trump’s twist: real estate-ism.<br>Anyone trying to assess the foreign policy of this White House needs to appreciate these distinctions. The various individuals responsible for national security in the Trump administration are united in their rejection of both the liberal idealism that informed the speeches (if not the actions) of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and the neoconservative version of idealism that inspired George W. Bush’s Global War on Terror. Yet there is much more to Trump 2.0 than the hard-nosed realism of Richard Nixon - a key influence on Trump, as I have argued elsewhere.<br>No previous president has livestreamed his Oval Office meetings with foreign leaders. That week in February when Trump hosted - and, to varying degrees, humiliated - the French president, the British prime minister, and the Ukrainian president introduced to great-power politics the unmistakable style of The Apprentice, the TV show that made Trump a household name. As Trump acknowledged, his and Vice President J.D. Vance’s shouting match with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian leader, was “great television.”<br>At the same time, the negotiations that he and his golfing friend Steve Witkoff are conducting in both Eastern Europe and the Middle East draw on an earlier chapter in Trump’s career. As Witkoff explained to The Atlantic, he and Trump see diplomacy as functionally indistinguishable from doing real-estate deals. “Diplomacy is negotiation,” Witkoff told Isaac Stanley-Becker. “I’ve been doing it my whole life.”<br>It is not difficult to ridicule the way Trump and Witkoff have approached the task of ending Russia’s war against Ukraine, a task Trump insisted on the campaign trail that he could achieve within 24 hours. Witkoff’s sycophantic interactions with President Vladimir Putin, a cold-blooded practitioner of realpolitik, have been painful to watch. His account of these interactions in an interview with Tucker Carlson was risible.<br>Vladimir Putin and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff at their talks in Moscow on April 25, 2025. (Photo by Kristina Kormilitsyna via Getty Images)<br>The fact that the war has significantly escalated since Trump’s peace initiative began - with Russian air strikes reaching new peaks and Ukraine countering Sunday with an audacious drone attack on Russian strategic bomber bases - speaks for itself.<br>Yes, Trump inherited a truly terrible strategic position from Joe Biden and his foreign policy team, who substituted “de-escalation” for deterrence and watched as America’s enemies inflicted harm on its friends in Afghanistan, Ukraine, and Israel. A formidable Axis of Authoritarians emerged under the Biden presidency, uniting China, Iran, and North Korea in support of Russia’s war. Even if the Original Sin of Biden’s mental decline and its concealment did not impact foreign policy as much as domestic policy, he certainly was not equal to the task that confronted him. As Walter Russell Mead has rightly said: “In 2023 and 2024 America needed a president who could explain. . . what we needed to do to stop the drift toward a new era of international confrontation. This is something Mr. Biden would have struggled with even if he were in full possession of his capacities; it was utterly beyond him in his diminished state.”<br>To those in the national security establishment currently criticizing Trump and Witkoff, Senator Lindsey Graham asks questions as legitimate as they are profane: “What the fuck have you done when it comes to Putin? How did your approach work?” Trump is far from the first president to try to schmooze Putin.<br>Yet the failures of the recent past do not absolve us from asking if reality TV plus real estate adds up to a strategy. Liberals on both sides of the Atlantic lament that Trump is an imperialist who wants to carve up the world between the United States, Russia, and China. But it is hard to detect a coherent imperial project in the combination of territorial claims (on Canada, Greenland, and Panama), tariffs imposed as much on allies as on adversaries, and peace initiatives in Eastern Europe and the Middle East that are sometimes hard to distinguish from business deals.<br>Trump is sometimes called an isolationist. I have never found this convincing. But I think it is true that, compared with almost every other president in the past century, he is deeply reluctant to use military force. This is partly out of a genuine horror of getting embroiled in one of those “forever wars” that have haunted Americans from Vietnam to Afghanistan. But it is also because Trump learned in his first term not to trust the top brass of the U.S. armed forces. He will never forgive Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for his communications with his Chinese counterpart in the run-up to the 2020 election and his condemnation of the subsequent January 6 invasion of the Capitol.<br>The odd thing is that Trump’s preference for peace over war does not truly reflect the sentiment of the electorate. Gallup polling shows that Americans today are quite strongly hostile to China and Russia (more so than to Iran or North Korea). According to a March 2025 poll, 46 percent of voters think the United States is not doing enough to help Ukraine in its war with Russia, up from 30 percent in December. While Democrats have soured on Israel, as a new Chicago Council survey reveals, around three-quarters of Republicans favor U.S. military support for Israel not only “until the hostages are returned” but also “until Hamas is dismantled or destroyed.” And more than two-fifths (42 percent) of Republicans said last year that, in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan, they would support “using the U.S. Navy to break a Chinese blockade of Taiwan, even if this might trigger a direct conflict between the United States and China.”<br>On all these issues, Trump is much less belligerent than his own base. He is strongly disinclined to continue U.S. aid to Ukraine. He is so keen to resuscitate the Iran nuclear deal that he now seems willing to allow Iran to carry on with low-level uranium enrichment. And we know from John Bolton’s memoir, The Room Where It Happened, that Trump would be very reluctant indeed to risk a war with China over Taiwan. This pacifism is one of the things that Trump’s liberal critics seem unable to acknowledge. The notion that he is an imperialist or even a fascist flies in the face of the evidence that the man is a peacenik at heart. Put it this way: fantasizing about wearing papal vestments is not the usual behavior of a bellicose autocrat.<br>But making peace is historically harder than launching wars - or, for that matter, buying skyscrapers. Trump is learning this the painful way in both the Middle East and Eastern Europe.<br>Demonstrators gather at he “Don’t Abandon Ukraine” rally in <br>Washington D.C. (Photo by Hanna Leka via Getty Images)<br>What kind of “peace” does he envision in Ukraine? First, Ukraine will relinquish its claim to Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, along with all or most of Luhansk and Donetsk. Second, Ukraine will renounce the possibility of membership in NATO. Third, in place of a U.S. military guarantee, Washington and Kyiv have signed an agreement that commits the United States to invest in Ukrainian natural resources.<br>This might seem like a very sweet deal from Moscow’s vantage point. It has certainly required major concessions by President Zelensky. And yet we seem no nearer to a ceasefire, much less a lasting peace, than we were on Inauguration Day more than four months ago. The most the Russians have offered was a three-day ceasefire to coincide with its celebrations of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. Negotiations in Istanbul in May achieved nothing because Putin was a no-show. A new round of talks that began there yesterday seems unlikely to bear much fruit.<br>The reason is clear: Putin shows no sign of modifying his demands not only for territory but also to limit Ukraine’s ability to arm and govern itself. Russia’s goal is not just land; it is to render Ukraine defunct as an independent state.<br>Despite his strong preference to blame Zelensky for the war and to woo Putin with the carrot of sanctions relief (and deals, deals, deals), Trump is being forced to admit that Putin is, in fact, the principal obstacle to peace. “I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia,” the president declared on Truth Social on May 25, “but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!”<br>The same day, Trump told journalists “I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin. I’ve known him a long time. Always gotten along with him. But he’s sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don’t like it at all. We’re in the middle of talking and he’s shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities.” Two days later, he resorted to threats on Truth Social: “What Vladimir Putin doesn’t realize is that if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He’s playing with fire!”<br>Unfortunately, the Russians must have read in the Financial Times about the TACO (“Trump Always Chickens Out”) trade. The Russian response to Trump’s threats was sarcastic. “Trump’s message leaves little room for misinterpretation,” Russian state media tweeted last Tuesday. “Until he posts the opposite tomorrow morning.” When both FT and RT are laughing at you, something is wrong with your dealpolitik.<br>The lesson of history is entirely clear: Wars are hard to stop - unless one side wins a decisive victory. “I was intellectually convinced that Hanoi would settle only if deprived of all hope of victory by a determined military strategy,” Henry Kissinger recalled in his book Ending the Vietnam War. “But I was,” he wrote, “also the principal advocate in the administration for negotiations for a political solution.”<br>The Nixon administration’s effort to negotiate an end to the war can be said to have begun in earnest on August 4, 1969, though Lyndon Johnson had been trying to do the same thing since May 1968. The Paris Peace Accords were signed on January 27, 1973, though they did not secure lasting peace between North and South Vietnam, the latter of which was swallowed up by the former two years later. At best, in other words, it took Kissinger three years, five months, and 24 days to secure a very short-lived peace in Vietnam - and in the course of the negotiations, the United States frequently escalated its military pressure on Hanoi in the hope of securing a diplomatic breakthrough.<br>It took less time to secure an armistice in Korea than to reach peace in Vietnam: The process that began in Kaesong in July 1951 lasted two years and 18 days, and the result has endured to this day.<br>The implications for Ukraine are clear. With sustained Western support, it has a shot at being a version of South Korea. If America settles for an unsustainable peace, it will share the grim fate of South Vietnam. Neither outcome gets done quickly.<br>Russia today has four times the population of Ukraine and ten times the GDP. Russia’s public finances, inflation, and current account are all in much better shape. Even if Western support for Ukraine continues at the level of the past three years, I fear that Russia will sooner or later grind out a victory, despite the resolve and heroism of the Ukrainian people, for the simple reason that Russia has superior resources and Axis support for Russia more than matches Western support for Ukraine. House Republicans - with Trump’s encouragement - have already interrupted U.S. aid to Ukraine once. They could do it again if Trump’s mood swings once more against Kyiv. Why would Putin settle under such conditions?<br>To see the flaw in Trump’s strategy, you have to grasp how crucial U.S. support - financial, but especially military - has been to Ukraine’s war effort. Thus far, according to the Kiel Ukraine Support Tracker, the European Union institutions and member states have accounted for 31 percent of all aid commitments to Ukraine, 29 percent of aid actually allocated, and 35 percent of total military allocations. But the United States -one country, as opposed to 27 -is responsible for nearly as much: 28 percent of all allocations and the same percentage of military allocations.<br>As The New York Times revealed in March, from early in the war U.S. military officers stationed in Wiesbaden used American technology and intelligence to help the Ukrainians target Russian units, equipment, and infrastructure. The provision of High Mobility Artillery Systems (HIMARS) in September 2022 was a key reason for Ukrainian battlefield success that autumn.<br>Later in the war, the U.S. sent dozens of “subject matter experts” - i.e., military advisers - from Wiesbaden to Kyiv. These experts helped the Ukrainians plan their drone strikes against Russian warships in the Black Sea and military assets in Crimea. They even helped the Ukrainians identify targets in an “ops box” - a zone of Russian territory - from which attacks on Kharkiv were being launched. It was U.S. assistance that made possible the massive drone attack on the Russian munitions depot at Toropets, 290 miles north of the Ukrainian border.<br>It has often been argued that backing Ukraine was an extraordinary bargain for the United States. For a commitment of roughly $175 billion in assistance and Ukraine-related spending since the war began, Hal Brands has argued, the United States cleaned out stocks of aging weaponry, stimulated U.S. production of 155 mm artillery shells, gave contracts worth $120 billion to U.S. companies, and helped the Ukrainians kill around 200,000 Russian soldiers and destroy thousands of Russian tanks.<br>Ukrainian servicemen load a truck with American made missiles. (Photo by Sergei Supinsky via Getty Images)<br>Brands is right that, if the U.S. had not acted when Putin invaded and the Ukrainians fought back, then eventually “Ukraine would have fallen, allowing Moscow to create pervasive insecurity in Europe. Russia and China... would have had all the global momentum.” But the Biden administration at no point had a credible endgame. They failed to grasp that the longer the war dragged on, the more likely Russia was to grind down Ukraine - unless the West could somehow increase its military and financial support. Yet that was never politically plausible. On the contrary, it was predictable from the outset that Americans and Europeans would become “fatigued” by the war - or perhaps just bored - if it dragged on for much more than a year.<br>The Trump solution seemed simple: End the war. But the reality is that unless the U.S. and EU apply serious pressure to Russia, Putin has no incentive to end the war. Up until this point, the much-vaunted sanctions imposed on Russia by the West since February 2022 have been a case study in the limits of economic coercion. Russia has made more from selling energy to Europe in the last three years than Ukraine has received in aid from the EU. At the same time, European countries continue to export large quantities of goods to Russia via third countries, most of them in Central Asia.<br>Four steps could be taken immediately to toughen the sanctions regime - and incentivize Putin to end the war. First, the U.S. could follow Europe’s lead in expanding sanctions on Russia’s tanker fleet and the companies that provide services to these tankers. Second, the U.S. could impose tighter restrictions on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Third, the U.S. could place additional large Russian firms on the Specially Designated Nationals blacklist, as the Biden administration did with Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas in January. (An obvious target could be Gazprom, though the European states that continue to buy Russian gas would strongly oppose such a move.) Fourth, the Trump administration could make good on its threats to impose “secondary tariffs” on Russian oil imported by other countries. That could easily form part of the current U.S. trade talks with India. These and other measures would inflict pain on a Russian war economy that is already showing clear signs of overextension. I hope the Trump administration is seriously considering at least some of these steps. But I see little sign that it is.<br>Diplomacy turns out to be quite different from reality TV and real estate. The best diplomacy is conducted secretly, not on live TV. And when a national security strategy goes awry, bankruptcy is not an option. There is no Chapter 11 for a failed foreign policy.<br>Steve Witkoff assured readers of The Atlantic that he has been doing his homework. He had, he said, “read many books and watched Netflix documentaries on world conflicts (including Turning Point: The Vietnam War).” Among the things he had learned from “watch[ing] a ton of stuff on Henry Kissinger” was that Kissinger had persuaded Nixon not to end the Vietnam War before the 1972 election, because the conflict gave him leverage in the reelection campaign. “It was a sellout,” Witkoff told the magazine. He “would never be able to live with myself” if he did such a thing.<br>That this almost entirely misrepresents what happened in 1972 illustrates the tragedy of American amnesia. The reality was an excruciating three-year negotiation with North Vietnam’s obdurate representatives, in which Kissinger tried to exert every available form of leverage in pursuit of a peace that would preserve American credibility and give South Vietnam at least a shot at survival. In the end, it could not be done. Saigon fell.<br>The fall of Kyiv is not an event anyone in Washington - or in Brussels - wants to contemplate. Those sympathetic to Ukraine want to believe that, with a combination of Western aid and Ukrainian ingenuity, David can get the better of Goliath. Those - not least Trump - who would rather do deals with Goliath want to believe that, with a little help from Steve Witkoff, Goliath can be persuaded to shake hands with David and call it quits. Neither of these views is realistic. If anything, the Trump view is the less realistic of the two.<br>Witkoff should pause to ask himself what Netflix documentaries will be saying about his and Trump’s real-estate-politik 50 years hence. I could be wrong. Perhaps the administration will surprise me by belatedly applying serious economic pressure to Russia. But if Ukraine ultimately goes the way of South Vietnam, I doubt those documentaries will be flattering.<br>The Free Press earns a commission from any purchases made through all book links in this article.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R84" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">85</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/4/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TRƯỚC KHI ĐỌC SÁCH… XIN CHỬI CHA NƯỚC MỸ!<br>Này nhé… đám giang hồ hỏi nhau bằng tiếng Anh: <br>“Đê mê mày nhé, đứa biết hai thứ tiếng thì gọi là gì?” <br>– Cộc (typo không nói tục mà): Bilingual!<br>“Giỏi, thế ba thứ tiếng?” <br>– Lại con cộc, Trilingual, ngu vừa thôi!<br>“Thế chỉ biết một thứ tiếng thì gọi là gì?<br>- Chỉ có thể là mày, gọi là American!<br>Không sai chút nào vì mỗi khi có biến động trên thế giới, nhà báo Mỹ chỉ có thể hỏi ai biết tiếng Anh, cha bố lũ chó con (gọi chó con cho tiện chứ, sorry, biết giống chó không đẻ ra loại đó!) chứ nào biết Martin Gurri, Douglas Murray, Konstantin Kisin hay Bernard-Henry Lévy, etc… là những ai!) <br>Rồi chúng mừng là không bị đạn lạc, chạy về tường thuật theo lối nông cạn của Mỹ, rằng làn sóng dân chủ là tất yếu!

The White House also is weighing the use of a separate, controversial process called impoundment to claw back funds, sidestepping the legislative branch and setting up a likely legal battle.<br>The initial rescissions package includes $8.3 billion in cuts to foreign aid and trims $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. The measure can pass the Republican-controlled House and Senate with a simple majority, but some GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about the package.<br>Republicans have promoted rescissions as a method to codify cuts identified by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric-vehicle maker Tesla and space company SpaceX, left the administration last week after a whirlwind four months that upended the federal government. The package includes cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the foreign-assistance agency DOGE gutted within two weeks.<br>Republican leaders have said they wanted to move quickly on the package, just as they are also working to advance President Trump’s “one big, beautiful” bill that cuts taxes while also trimming spending on Medicaid and food aid. That bill passed the House last month, and the Senate is now taking it up.<br>The director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, said the rescissions “would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests,” such as funding the World Health Organization and LGBTQ activities. He called public media “politically biased” and an “unnecessary expense to the taxpayer.”<br>Elon Musk is done with the Department of Government Efficiency. The agency claims to have saved taxpayers more than $170 billion with its aggressive cost-cutting. Did DOGE live up to Musk’s promises?

He said the proposal is “one of the many legislative tools Republicans are using to restore fiscal sanity.” <br>In lawsuits filed last week, NPR and PBS said Trump’s executive order to pull funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was unconstitutional and violated federal law, with PBS calling it “blatant viewpoint discrimination.”<br>Patricia Harrison, CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, said federal funding is “irreplaceable” in serving American households. She said CPB is “firmly committed to ensuring that funding for public media provides local communities with accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news and information, and we take seriously concerns about bias.”<br>Aside from the public-broadcasting rescissions, the package sent to Congress on Tuesday would rescind funding from a number of foreign-aid agencies: $3.6 billion from USAID, $2.36 billion from the State Department, $27 million from the Inter-American Foundation, $22 million from the African Development Foundation and $15 million from United States Institute of Peace.<br>The launching of the rescissions package is intended to underline GOP leaders’ dedication to cost-cutting amid criticism from some Republican fiscal hawks that the tax and spending bill doesn’t sufficiently reduce spending.<br>The overall rescissions package falls short of the $175 billion DOGE claims to have saved through a combination of asset sales, contract cancellations, job cuts and other moves - a figure challenged by budget observers across the political spectrum.<br>For Democrats, who have rallied against Musk, the package is a referendum on the billionaire’s stint in government.

Susan Collins (R., Maine), who chairs the Appropriations Committee, told reporters Tuesday she wouldn’t support cuts to PEPFAR, the government’s HIV/AIDS relief program, outlined in the package.

The move would involve Trump refusing to spend money appropriated by Congress. A 1974 law long contested by Vought allows Congress to review or overturn impoundments within 45 days.<br>Vought has also suggested “pocket rescissions” - or proposing rescissions within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year, which could cause funds to remain unspent even if Congress doesn’t act. “It’s one of the reasons why we are not putting all of our expectations in a typical rescissions process,” Vought said.<br>Such moves would challenge the Impoundment Control Act, which bars presidents from withholding funds that Congress has appropriated.

Click here to mark it in your calendars. — Oliver Wiseman<br>***<br>William F. Buckley Jr., born 100 years ago this November, was the most influential American journalist of the 20th century.<br>From the publication of Buckley’s first book in 1951 when he was 25, to his death in 2008, the author, debater, speaker, editor, columnist, and television personality inspired, chronicled, built, and guided the conservative movement that revolutionized American politics.<br>From his energy and devotion to human freedom came lasting institutions. In 1953 Buckley helped found the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, which educates college students in conservative thought. In 1955 he launched National Review, the house magazine of the conservative movement. In 1960 he presided over the founding of Young Americans for Freedom, an activist group devoted to bringing conservatives to college campuses. Two years later, Buckley launched a syndicated column and helped create the Conservative Party of New York State. In 1964 he helped organize the conservative capture of the GOP, with the nomination of Barry Goldwater. In 1965 he ran as the Conservative Party candidate for mayor of New York City. In 1966 he debuted as host of Firing Line on PBS. He signed off 33 years later.<br>His output was gargantuan. Thousands of columns and articles. Some 60 books. More than 1,500 episodes of Firing Line. An average of 70 speeches a year across 40 years. When he died aged 82, Buckley was at his desk. Another deadline loomed.<br>Buckley’s life is a case study in natural talent as well as the value of hard work, dedication, style, and charm. A paradox makes him endlessly fascinating: Buckley’s principles and personality never seemed to change, but his movement shape-shifted often. It still does.<br>No wonder, then, that interest in Buckley endures. Scholars publish books on various aspects of his legacy, from his friendships and rivalries to his television show. Filmmakers produce documentaries on his public falling-out with Gore Vidal (The Best of Enemies, 2015) and on his life story (The Incomparable Mr. Buckley, 2024). Posthumous collections and personal reminiscences appear regularly - try Getting About: Travel Writings of William F. Buckley Jr. and Right Time, Right Place: Coming of Age with William F. Buckley Jr. and the Conservative Movement by Richard Brookhiser. The U.S. Postal Service is even set to release a Buckley stamp.<br>Then there are the biographies. By my count, former New York Times Book Review editor Sam Tanenhaus, whose Buckley: The Life and the Revolution that Changed America is released today, is no less than the sixth person to tackle Buckley’s story. And while there will be other biographers, no doubt, Tanenhaus stands apart.<br>Buckley authorized Tanenhaus’s work and granted him special access. Tanenhaus spent close to three decades on Buckley. The final product is, if nothing else, extraordinarily long, coming in at more than 1,000 pages. It weighs more than three pounds. Tanenhaus has delivered an engrossing book that the literary world is sure to crown as the definitive treatment of Buckley’s life, career, and importance.<br>Which is the problem.<br>Despite its length, Buckley feels oddly abbreviated. One suspects that Tanenhaus wrote enough material for two volumes, then performed literary liposuction to squeeze the manuscript into one. The patient survived - but vital organs have been removed.<br>Buckley’s wife Pat gets short shrift. His son Christopher, another masterly writer, barely appears. Buckley himself leaves the story during several long passages.<br>Worse, the final 34 years of Buckley’s life are jammed into a mere 100 pages. Seven presidencies. The end of the Cold War. Two Iraq wars. Buckley’s long withdrawal from the public stage. Dozens of books. All relegated to an extended epilogue.<br>Until now, I’ve never read a thousand-page book that left me wanting more. Tanenhaus has achieved the impossible.<br>Tanenhaus concentrates on Buckley’s upbringing, education, and professional ascent. The story of his life intersects with the drama of domestic politics during the Cold War, and with the intellectual and media culture of mid-century America. Throughout, Tanenhaus applies his own gloss to the history of the American right. That interpretation, while subtle, is nevertheless misleading. It reflects the same liberal consensus that Buckley spent his life undoing.<br>Tanenhaus ignores or oversimplifies the forces that animate the revolution he’s narrating - perhaps because he either misunderstands or misinterprets conservatism, which he pronounced dead 16 years ago.<br>For Tanenhaus, conservatism is noblest when it reinforces, rather than repudiates, programs of liberal reform. His ideal conservative would write theoretical tomes on the connection between tradition and progress - and leave politics to progressive intellectuals and policy wonks. A conservative who enters the political arena is therefore inherently suspect. His motives must be impure. Animus drives his defense of tradition, which, according to progressives, is really a defense of privilege.<br>Thus, Buckley’s opposition to the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s takes precedence over his crusade against totalitarian communism. In this telling, white backlash drives conservative success, not the complex reality of public frustration with rising crime, civil unrest, welfare dependency, high taxes, inflation, environmental regulation, and anti-American radicalism.<br>The social issues central to Buckley’s worldview are barely mentioned. Secularization, second-wave feminism, family breakdown, abortion - the omissions are striking. The Catholic Buckley was a committed pro-life advocate. He founded a quarterly publication, The Human Life Review, devoted to protecting the rights of the unborn. Abortion barely registers in Tanenhaus’s tale.<br>Tanenhaus also neglects Buckley’s fight against antisemitism on the right. He devotes ample space to Buckley’s father’s antisemitism, and to some of Buckley’s older siblings burning a cross in a shameful prank. But In Search of Anti-Semitism (1992), where Buckley confronts his family history and repudiates anti-Jewish bigotry within his movement, is excluded. Given the return of violent antisemitism directed at Jews everywhere, including in America, Buckley’s stand is not only relevant. It’s essential.<br>Conservatives will be disappointed in Buckley. Yet liberals won’t be entirely satisfied, either. There are no salacious revelations in the book. No incriminating evidence. Tanenhaus may not have much affection for conservatism, but he does feel warmly toward Buckley. He writes in a spirit of genuine sympathy and admiration for the man and his family. He describes Buckley’s generosity, compassion, and gift for friendship. He relishes Buckley’s wit. And he acknowledges liberal weaknesses. “What drew so many to his attacks on liberals,” Tanenhaus writes of Buckley, “was his perception - shared by the leftists [Norman] Mailer and Paul Goodman - that beneath their superficial piety and virtue lurked the chill spirit of conformism and perhaps coercion.”<br>Well said. Except there’s no reason to include the perhaps. And it wasn’t just radical intellectuals who held this “perception.” It was most of the country - which is why Buckley’s impact was far greater than either Mailer’s or Goodman’s.<br>Patient readers will come away from Buckley with some insight into the man and movement. Tanenhaus singles out a moment in Buckley’s young adulthood, when he attended the 1948 Republican National Convention. There he watched the playwright, socialite, and former congresswoman Clare Boothe Luce light up the stage with attacks on the Truman Democrats. Buckley was entranced. “It was his first exposure to politics as comic performance,” writes Tanenhaus.<br>For Tanenhaus, Buckley was above all a theatrical performer. He was a controversialist devoted to attacking liberal hypocrisy and self-delusion. Quips, barbs, sarcasm, and exaggeration were his trusted weapons. “Buckley’s true métier as writer and talker - eventually reaching levels approaching genius - was for intellectual comedy, an almost continual repartee,” writes Tanenhaus. Some conservatives may read this characterization as dismissive. They may assume that Tanenhaus is reducing Buckley to a court jester. That would be a mistake.<br>Performance is essential to both politics and leadership. A leader must act the part. To direct the crowd, he must distinguish himself from the crowd. Charisma and willpower are required, along with a common touch. A sense of humor is a powerful attractant.<br>For Buckley, jokes weren’t just a way to bring liberals down a peg or two. They were a way for him to relate to his audience. And to persuade. Laughter is hard to control - and if people who don’t consider themselves conservative begin laughing with you, you have won half the battle.<br>“For Tanenhaus, Buckley was above all a theatrical performer,” writes Matthew Continetti. “He was a controversialist devoted to attacking liberal hypocrisy and self-delusion.”<br>The two most successful Republican presidents of the past 50 years‚ Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, are funny (in wildly different ways). Similarly, Buckley’s persona was a remarkable success on stage, in print, and on television. There were times when the show flopped—Buckley’s first clash with James Baldwin, and his threat to punch Gore Vidal on live television. There were times when it veered into self-parody—several recycled books, introducing Brideshead Revisited on Masterpiece Theater. But those missteps also point to Buckley’s longevity, and to his personal attachment with his audience.<br>Buckley was more than a scholar or a political philosopher. He was a movement leader. And to forge a movement, you must win over the kids. You must make college students believe in a cause—in Buckley’s case, the cause of individual freedom, personal responsibility, and anti-communism.<br>Growing the movement, turning it into a durable political entity, requires prudence. Tanenhaus writes extensively on Buckley’s youth, on his opening salvo against Yale University in 1951, on his enmity toward the Eisenhower administration, on his radical challenge to the bipartisan, Organization Man ethos that prevailed in the ’50s and early ’60s.<br>The nomination of Barry Goldwater as the Republican nominee in 1964 was the high point of this damn-the-torpedoes conservatism. “I would remind you,” Goldwater thundered in his acceptance speech, “that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.”<br>Goldwater lost, of course. Badly. By 1968, amid war, assassinations, and riots, Buckley found himself on the side of institutional order. After years of hedging, he had denounced the conspiratorial John Birch Society. He began finding common cause with anti-communist liberals alarmed at student radicalism. Though his friend Ronald Reagan, one year into his governorship in California, was looking to enter the 1968 Republican primary, Buckley backed the establishment alternative: former vice president Richard Nixon. “No sense running Mona Lisa in a beauty contest,” he told a journalist in 1967. “I’d be for the most right, viable candidate who could win it.” Thus was born the “Buckley Rule.”<br>Buckley went from radical outsider to mainstream insider. In the 1970s the New Right (one of many) attacked his aristocratic lifestyle and fidelity to limited-government, free-market principles. Yet Buckley remained focused on liberal folly. His movement flourished under Reagan, whose coalition encompassed not just National Review conservatives but also populists, the New Christian Right, and Reagan Democrats.<br>Buckley stayed true to what he called, in typical multisyllabic fashion, the “paradigm” of individual freedom consistent with law and order. Meanwhile, American conservatism’s list of issues and cast of characters kept changing.<br>Buckley went from isolationism in 1941 to support for foreign intervention against communism in 1950. Senator Robert Taft, leader of the Old Right, died in 1953. Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Red hunter, was censured in 1954 and died in 1957. Then Goldwater lost, and conservatives looked to Nixon. Two years into office, Nixon imposed price controls and recognized Communist China. Conservatives searched fruitlessly for an alternative. They found one in 1976, when Reagan challenged President Gerald Ford.<br>When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the conservative movement split. The journalist Patrick Buchanan advocated a return to the old ways—nonintervention abroad, resistance to liberalism at home. Buckley sided with Buchanan’s opponents, who believed that America had a responsibility to guarantee international security in the post–Cold War era. Near the end of his life, when it became clear America would not find weapons of mass destruction, Buckley reevaluated his support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The right was about to change once more.<br>He didn’t live to see the transformation. The contemporary right prioritizes national sovereignty. It shies away from military force. It’s enticed by Nixon’s approach to government intervention in the economy on behalf of “the hard hats.”<br>Sam Tanenhaus’s gracefully written, informative, and sometimes maddening biography avoids contemporary politics. But we can reasonably guess how William F. Buckley Jr. would respond to the present. He would oppose big government, the inevitable enemy of faith and freedom, and its partisans in both parties. He would skewer liberal intellectuals. And he would remain unabashedly patriotic, proud of his country, its people, its ideals, and all it has accomplished.<br>“The American,” he said, “must believe.”<br>Reaffirming belief in God, country, family, and free enterprise—this was Buckley’s mission. Liberals may miss the point.

He has sought to show the White House he is ready for a truce even while rebuffing Putin’s draconian demands.<br>“It was the Russians who chose to continue the war, even under conditions where the entire world is calling for an end to the killing,” Zelensky said in a Sunday address to the nation. “And pressure is truly needed, pressure on Russia that should bring it back to reality.”<br>If the Trump administration has a strategy beyond appealing to Putin to halt the fighting in return for territorial concessions and other inducements, it has yet to make one clear. Former President Joe Biden sought to contain the conflict by imposing sanctions on Russia and establishing limits on how Ukraine could use some U.S.-provided missiles.<br>But Trump hasn’t sought to ratchet up the economic and military pressure on Russia. And he has yet to actively involve himself in planning for Ukraine’s defense, including coordinating on future weapons needs. He has been unusually silent about Ukraine’s drone strikes on Russian bases.<br>Zelensky told reporters Monday that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has proposed a four-leader summit for later this month featuring himself, Trump, Putin and the Ukrainian leader.

They secured Kyiv’s agreement to a 30-day cease-fire in the hope that Russia would soon follow suit, setting the stage for talks that would end the war.<br>But Moscow balked at agreeing to a truce, demanding that what it terms the “root causes” of the conflict be addressed - shorthand for barring Ukraine from accepting Western assistance and diminishing its sovereignty as an independent state.<br>Firefighters amidst the rubble of a destroyed warehouse.<br>Ukrainian firefighters and rescuers at the site of wreckage following an overnight attack last week.

Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) plan to introduce legislation next week that would impose steep tariffs on countries that buy Russian energy and uranium.

Also included was a limitation on the size of Ukraine’s armed forces.<br>It was another sign that Russia is determined to keep pressing the war it started.

Just ask the Treasury Secretary, who the tech billionaire branded a “Soros agent,” or the UK’s Prime Minister, who Musk accused of going soft on grooming gangs in January this year. But it seems the founder of the Department for Government Efficiency (DoGE) has been holding back a rather explosive opinion – one he could never share while he was popping in and out of the Oval Office, working for President Donald Trump.<br>“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Musk wrote this afternoon on his platform X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”<br>There it is: the biggest inconsistency of Trump’s agenda, finally said out loud by the person who can draw the most attention to it. <br>Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” is going to wipe out any savings made by DoGE. Worse, it’s going to make America’s deficit problem catastrophically worse, by adding an additional $2.6 trillion onto the deficit over the next decade. Trump’s decision to cut taxes much faster and more aggressively than spending. The problem is that both were pushed as options on the campaign trail during those last critical weeks. The Trump coalition – the one that led him to sweeping electoral success – was in part made up by fiscal conservatives who liked the idea of Musk taking an ax to government spending. The problem, however, is that the coalition was also composed of voters who liked Trump’s repeated promises that there would be no tradeoffs and no tough decisions along the way.<br>America has a debt crisis on its hands: when the bomb explodes is anyone’s guess (and lots of people are guessing). The country’s $36 trillion national debt is no longer sitting comfortably with those who would have once pointed out that the dollar is the reserve currency, or that cuts could be made if necessary. This latter point was Musk’s mission coming into government six months ago: to get federal spending under some semblance of control. <br>It turns out, there is no political will for shrinking the size of government. The remit of DoGE was originally to cut $2 trillion from the federal government’s budget deficit – an attempt to somewhat rebalance America’s spending habits with the amount of revenue it actually raises. This was quickly watered down to $1 trillion, as it became increasingly clear that there was no appetite among Team Trump to make cuts in controversial areas, including Social Security, Medicare or defense. <br>Musk left his position as a contractor last Friday – with a friendly press conference in the Oval Office – having delivered around $150 billion worth of cuts so far. Promising he’d still be involved, Musk insisted that DoGE would get to the one-trillion mark: “The DoGE influence will only grow stronger,” he said. “I’m confident that over time, we’ll see $1 trillion of savings, and a reduction in $1 trillion of waste, fraud reduction.”<br>Days later, the Dark MAGA campaigner seems to be suggesting he might be stumping in the midterms next year to reverse that Republican wave, sharing on X “in November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.” It’s certainly a change of tune. But don’t expect any change in the trajectory of government spending or debt. With Musk gone, DoGE on the rocks and the congressional bill moving through the Senate, both are set to keep growing.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R91" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">92</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/3/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỘT BÀI RẤT HAY – NÊN ĐỌC:<br>Vị trí Hong Kong (với đô la Hong Kong giàng giá vào Mỹ kim) trong trận thương chiến Mỹ-Hoa ngày nay! <br>https://plus.econvue.com/p/asian-financial-crisis-20...<br>Asian Financial Crisis 2.0<br>Could the Hong Kong peg get caught in the crossfire of US-China relations?<br>By Lyric Hughes Hale - EconVUE - Jun 03, 2025 ∙ Paid<br>💬 Reserves were enough to stop the last crisis. They may not be enough to prevent the next one.<br>The Hong Kong dollar peg, long a pillar of financial stability in Asia, now sits at the intersection of escalating US-China tensions. Drawing on insights from our conversation with the architect of the Hong Kong peg, economist John Greenwood, this article examines both the resilience and potential vulnerability of Hong Kong’s monetary regime. Geopolitical shifts, combined with an economic slowdown in China and across the region, have created significant headwinds for Hong Kong. The question is no longer whether the peg is sound, but whether it will be allowed to stand.<br>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent represent a new alignment in American economic statecraft - combining anti-communist hawkishness with hedge fund sophistication. In Beijing, Xi Jinping has determined that his country will be self-sufficient, even if this policy produces unsustainable economic inefficiencies. If hostilities increase, Xi could see the peg as a vector of attack on Fortress China.<br>In early May 2025, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in currency markets1 after the Hong Kong dollar surged to the top of its official trading band, driven mainly by inflows from large IPOs. The reaction of the currency board was automatic - but not unremarkable in terms of scale. Some observers wondered if this was a sign of pressure on the peg.<br>John Greenwood, Chief Economist at International Monetary Monitor<br>According to economist John Greenwood, widely regarded as the father of the Hong Kong peg, the May interventions were a sign of strength, not weakness. The currency board he designed performed exactly as planned. Underpinning the peg are significant US dollar reserves. During the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997-98, the foreign exchange reserves of many countries in the region were inadequate. But Hong Kong’s total reserves of $92.8 billion, more than seven times the monetary base, provided a strong defense against speculation, and the Hong Kong peg survived while others did not.<br>Today, Hong Kong’s reserves exceed $400 billion dollars, a fourfold increase from 1997. Greenwood has written that “it is inconceivable that the HKMA could ever find itself with inadequate USD reserves.”2<br>Breaking the Peg: Past Attempts<br>But this time, the threat may not come from a shortage of dollars, but from a surplus of geopolitical hostility. US tariff policies aimed at China have rattled markets with diminishing returns, policymakers may reach for new tools.<br>In 1998, Hong Kong’s monetary policy was largely autonomous. Today the PRC has near-total political control, using the city to surmount capital controls and funnel investment to Chinese firms. Could the Hong Kong peg be targeted by Washington, not because it is weak but because it works too well for Beijing?<br>Breaking the fixed link between the HKD and USD has been contemplated at least twice before: in 1998 for speculative purposes, and in 2020 as a tool of economic statecraft.<br>1998: Soros vs. Hong Kong<br>George Soros, who broke the Bank of England, attempted to duplicate this feat in Hong Kong. The CIO of Soros’ Quantum Fund during the 1998 attack was Scott Bessent, now US Treasury Secretary. If this were attempted again, Greenwood believes that the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) which maintains the peg within a tight band of 7.75 to 7.85 to the USD would not respond in the same way today as it did in 1998. Nowadays there are shock absorbers in place which would prevent the steep rise in rates experienced in 1998: Hong Kong and China have likely developed contingency plans. In fact, the HKMA has proactively diversified its reserves away from the dollar to other currencies.<br>2020: The Trump Administration Ponders a Run<br>In an interview with econVue from London, Greenwood shared new details from the first Trump administration, when tensions with Beijing surged after the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protests. The peg, he recounted, came closer to being weaponized than anyone knew.<br>    ❝ Following Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s 2020 declaration3 that HK was no longer autonomous, the Trump administration considered measures against Hong Kong, including excluding its banks from SWIFT and undermining the peg. A small team - David Malpass, Steve Hanke, and myself - convinced them to back off because of the risks to US businesses operating in Hong Kong.4<br>Although SWIFT5, the global interbank secure messaging system is based in Belgium, the US dominates the system. It controls the most correspondent banking relationships, and can enforce sanctions, as it did recently when Russia invaded Ukraine. Removing Hong Kong from SWIFT would topple the peg overnight, but most likely, as with Russia, an attack backed by sanctions would happen incrementally, beginning with a few targeted banks based in the PRC, such as the Bank of China.<br>Asian Financial Crisis 2.0<br>The Asian Financial Crisis appeared without warning, in July of 1997, in the wake of the Asian economic miracle.6 Now that growth has slowed, and Beijing’s relationship with Washington has cooled, post-Covid debt has substantially increased for both rich and poor nations in the region. Could a generalized financial crisis erupt again, unrelated to tensions with Beijing? If so, where would it begin, and how might it affect not just Asia, but the rest of the world?<br>Japan’s debt to GDP ratio is estimated at 263%, and China’s central government debt at 124% - similar to that of the US. However local government debt in China is a huge black box, estimated at $7-11 trillion. Poorer countries such as Myanmar and Pakistan face crushing amounts of US dollar denominated debt, in an environment of higher interest rates. 7<br>So although Hong Kong itself is financially strong, the neighborhood you live in matters too. Could a match to one of these piles of sovereign debt light up the rest of Asia, and if so could the careful design of the Hong Kong peg once again withstand such a crisis?<br>The Last Peg Standing in Asia<br>Hong Kong’s currency is the last major dollar peg left standing in Asia, a vestige of an earlier era of capital controls and post-Bretton Woods adjustment. Hong Kong survived the Asian Financial Crisis thanks to its unique monetary system: a currency board, the most rigid form of a peg. Unlike traditional fixed exchange rates that rely on active management by central banks, currency boards function automatically, like an ATM converting dollars and local currency, according to certain rules.<br>        The HKMA issues or redeems Hong Kong dollars at a fixed rate of 7.75–7.85 per USD.<br>        Every unit of local currency must be backed by US dollar reserves.<br>        No discretionary monetary policy is allowed.<br>It’s an elegant system that depends on confidence, credibility, and sufficient reserves.<br>🇭🇰 A Strong Currency, A Fragile Economy<br>Five years after the Hong Kong protests, international investors have staged a retreat, and risks are being weighed in a new geopolitical context. The HKMA still holds massive reserves and John Greenwood is still confident. But market sentiment, economic deterioration, and strategic recalibration are painting a more fragile picture.<br>So are there signs the peg may be losing its luster, as Hong Kong’s role has shifted?<br>        GDP growth in Hong Kong is forecast to slow from 3.1% to 1% in 20258<br>        Residential real estate prices have fallen by 30% since 2021, and commercial values are down by 40% 9<br>        Just as on the mainland, tax revenues are down and credit is tight for new projects. <br>The entire region has depended upon Chinese growth for momentum, which has now slowed. The peg remains intact - but for how long? If financial systems are the new front lines of geopolitical rivalry, Hong Kong’s currency peg may be an overlooked battlefield.<br>US Strategic Leadership: Rubio &amp; Bessent<br>Graphic credit: Sovannreach Po– The Miami Hurricane<br>Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent symbolize a new alignment in US economic statecraft - one that blends hawkish policy toward China with market-savvy tactics. Rubio, with his Cuban-American, anti-communist heritage, brings years of Congressional activism on Chinese trade and human rights; Bessent brings hedge fund precision and a history with Hong Kong’s monetary battles.<br>Rubio has recently taken decisive actions, including visa restrictions on Chinese students, and has long advocated for sanctions on Chinese trade an investment.10 Bessent, an expert in foreign exchange, now commands the full toolkit of Treasury reinforcement.<br>The recent spate of US tariffs suggests that if China and the US cannot find a new trade equilibrium, or should Beijing act against Taiwan, a coordinated attempt to undermine the peg is no longer unthinkable. However, it is not just US policy that creates a possible opening.<br>Since Xi Jinping came to power a dozen years ago, China’s economic policies have increasingly become China-centric. Post-Covid, they appear to be putting the country on a wartime footing and self-sufficiency is the clear goal. The reform process has ground to a halt, throwing sand in the wheels of global trade integration. Instead of switching to a consumption-based economy, China has doubled down on manufacturing for export, increasing trade frictions worldwide.<br>Fortress China: Bottom-Line Thinking<br>Beijing’s doctrine of “bottom-line thinking” (底线思维) calls for preparation for worst-case scenarios while pursuing optimal outcomes - for itself. Xi Jinping has invoked this concept repeatedly in speeches and Party journals such as Qiushi.11 Prioritizing self-sufficiency, even if it causes economic pain, unemployment, and slower growth, is at odds with an integrated global trading system.<br>Although US policy is seen as the catalyst for divergence and decoupling, it can be argued that this all began in Beijing.<br>From Beijing’s perspective, the Hong Kong dollar peg - reliant upon US monetary policy and dollar access - could be viewed as an unacceptable strategic dependency. If Washington were to weaponize that dependency, China’s southern financial flank could be exposed at a critical moment.<br>Will Bottom-Line Thinking on Both Sides Lead to Asian Financial Crisis 2.0?<br>Regardless of the origin story of the current trade war, is it in the US’s best interests to break the peg? Given China’s integration with the world trading system, it is a nuclear option for both sides.<br>Beijing’s penchant for worst-case scenario planning is now mirrored by a US administration prepared to weaponize global trade in order to tame the security threat they believe China represents. This raises the stakes for investors, multinationals, and policymakers navigating a politically-contested global financial system.<br>The peg grants China indirect access to the stability of the US dollar, insulating its economy through Hong Kong. But as US-China relations deteriorate and financial containment tools multiply - tariffs, export controls, and sanctions - the continued existence of the peg might seem incongruous.<br>Some may argue that the peg is a Cold War-era privilege extended to a partner now gone rogue. From a strategic standpoint, undermining the peg would limit China’s financial maneuverability, while testing Beijing’s capacity to defend against capital flight or currency crises.<br>With Scott Bessent, who tried to break the peg in 1998, now at the helm of the US Treasury, the question is no longer hypothetical. There is no doubt that he has the skillset to mount an attack; now he has the tools and perhaps the mandate if negotiations fail. What was once a market operation could become policy.<br>New Vulnerabilities &amp; Old Ghosts<br>What else could spark a second Asian Financial Crisis? The dollar’s recent weakness has stabilized the Hong Kong peg - for now. A far greater risk than a breakdown in trade negotiations is a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan which could provoke a response that weaponizes the peg, resulting in sanctions, capital flight, and systemic shock. Impact on global GDP of an invasion is estimated at greater than 10%; for a blockade the estimate is about 5%. 12<br>Any trigger that increases global risk aversion or strengthens the dollar could put pressure on the Hong Kong peg. The region now faces a cocktail of old risks in new forms:<br>   * Economic decoupling between China and the US is already accelerating, given momentum by national security concerns on both sides<br>   * War is often seen as irrational and unlikely - until it happens as it did between Russia and Ukraine. Military preparations in the Taiwan Strait and Chinese excursions along the first and second island chains close to Australia are concerning escalations.<br>    * China’s slowdown: deflation, weak demand, local government debt, youth unemployment, and fragile property markets.<br>    * Japan’s fragility: a spike in bond yields could unwind carry trades and suck capital out of Asia.<br>    * Sovereign defaults: smaller economies with heavy dollar-denominated debt could act as triggers.<br>    * A dollar crunch: tighter US monetary policy may drain FX reserves across the region.<br>    * Shadow banking: defaults among China’s trust companies or LGFVs could spread contagion.<br>All of these are plausible catalysts. But ultimately, confidence - not reserves or mechanics - will determine the peg’s fate.<br>The Peg: A Bridge, or a Weapon?<br>The Hong Kong dollar peg was once viewed as a symbol of post-war financial order and stability - a monetary bridge between China and the West. Today, Washington could turn it into a choke point to counter China’s actions, whether economic or military. As preparations for a kinetic confrontation gain speed, a currency war could erupt.<br>Given the players involved, the world’s two largest economies with radically different economic and political infrastructures, this is not merely theoretical. In 2020, the Trump administration seriously contemplated undermining the peg, and only backed off after warnings from a small group that included John Greenwood. Today, as US-China tensions rise, the political calculus could overwhelm economic interests and plans.<br>John Greenwood remains confident in the peg’s design. Will hefty reserves, and an elegantly constructed currency board, be enough to weather the strident rivalry between the US and China?

You know it,” said Musk, in comments on his X social-media platform. Musk, who left the administration last week, called the package a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill.”<br>Musk’s comments are his latest sharp words about the package, which includes tax cuts as well as reductions to spending on Medicaid and food assistance. Last month he gave new fuel to GOP critics of the Republicans’ multitrillion-dollar agenda, saying that the current measure failed to reduce the federal deficit. <br>In all, the bill is expected to increase budget deficits by $2.7 trillion through 2034, compared with doing nothing, though a final official estimate wasn’t available. Top Republican defenders of the measure argue that the tax cuts will fuel increased economic growth to close the fiscal gap. <br>The bill narrowly passed the House last month by one vote. It is now in the hands of the Senate, where some fiscal hawks, including Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah and Rick Scott of Florida, have demanded deeper cuts. The Senate is expected to make changes to the bill and then send it back to the House. <br>“The Senate must make this bill better,” Lee wrote in a response to Musk’s post. <br>Trump “already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday when asked about Musk’s social-media post. “It doesn’t change the president’s opinion.”<br>House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) said Musk is “terribly wrong.” He said that the bill is a “very important first start” in cutting costs and that the package will be “jet fuel for the economy.”<br>Trump hosted Musk at a farewell Oval Office news conference last week, where the two men heaped praise on each other, aiming to counter the perceptions that their partnership had frayed.<br>The current tax-and-spending proposal would extend expiring tax cuts for all income groups and create new tax cuts on top of that, including bigger tax deductions for state and local taxes, and versions of Trump’s campaign-trail promises to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime pay and Social Security benefits.<br>President Trump recently said he wasn’t happy with all aspects of the Republican tax-and-spending bill, which needs widespread party support to pass. Photo: Chris Kleponis/Bloomberg News<br>The bill would provide new money for border security, national defense and support for farmers. To cover some - but not all - of those costs, the bill would reduce spending on green-energy tax credits, Medicaid and food assistance. <br>The Senate has been weighing a number of changes to the bill, including on Medicaid and clean energy.<br>Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has objected to the debt-limit increase included in the package, said both he and Musk “have both seen the massive waste in government spending and we know another $5 trillion in debt is a huge mistake. We can and must do better.”<br>Trump attacked Paul on social media earlier Tuesday, saying the senator “has very little understanding of the [big, beautiful bill], especially the tremendous GROWTH that is coming.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R93" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">94</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/3/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">GÁNH NỢ ĐÁNG SỢ CỦA NƯỚC MỸ<br>Hoa Kỳ phải đi vay để trả nợ, và năm nay tiền lời thanh toán cho gánh nợ sẽ mấp mé ngàn tỷ, cao hơn ngân sách quốc phòng.

Because the math is getting daunting with interest on the debt blowing past $1 trillion annually and Washington acting recklessly. Even people who have issued past warnings deserve a second (or third, or fourth) hearing. <br>Hedge-fund manager Ray Dalio does have something to sell - his book, “How Countries Go Broke,” out Tuesday. But the world’s 172nd-richest person is hardly staking his reputation on royalties, and his arguments are compelling. Dalio told Bloomberg he gives America “three years, give or take a year” to avert an economic “heart attack.”<br>Peter Orszag, chief executive of investment bank Lazard and a former budget director, wrote last week that “those who bemoaned the unsustainability of deficit spending and debt levels” back during his time in government “seemed to cry wolf - a lot.” Now he’s worried, too, because the wolf is “lurking much closer to our door.”<br>The package of tax-and-spending measures sent to the Senate, now officially called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, could act like budgetary wolf bait. It would add around $3 trillion to debt levels over the next decade compared with existing estimates and $5 trillion if certain temporary features were made permanent, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.<br>For perspective, federal interest this fiscal year already will be more than the defense budget and more than Medicaid, disability insurance and food stamps combined.<br>Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates assume that the bond market will not only tolerate a surge in spending but become more relaxed about it with lower yields. Consider if the yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed at today’s level of around 4.4% for the coming decade. Then the CRFB estimates it would add another $1.8 trillion in interest costs over that period.<br>And what if yields surge instead in a vicious cycle? JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon warned on Friday of the consequences: “You are going to see a crack in the bond market, OK?”<br>Yet the bond market isn’t exactly collapsing, even if 30-year yields recently hit a postcrisis high. So who are you going to believe, millions of fairly relaxed investors or some wealthy pundits? <br>Projection for 2034DebtDebt under OBBBA2010&#39;15&#39;20&#39;25&#39;3001020304050$60 trillion<br>Another hedge-fund manager, Paul Tudor Jones, calls the paradox an economic “kayfabe,” a term from professional wrestling.

But it doesn’t have to: Rapid inflation would accomplish the same thing if the Fed had to ride to the rescue through a measure called fiscal dominance. <br>What is the tipping point for the bond market to go from mild anxiety to the sort of concern that feeds on itself? Former International Monetary Fund chief economist Kenneth Rogoff, an authority on debt crises, explained in April that they “are never a matter of simple arithmetic.”<br>“Almost every country default - either through outright default or high inflation - occurs long before debt calculus forces it to,” he said.<br>Despite Dalio’s guesstimate, knowing when doomsayers will be proven right is impossible. Consider Stein’s Law: “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” (Contrary to urban legend, that line wasn’t uttered by Ben Stein, who played the boring economics teacher in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” but by his father, Herb, an actual economist.)<br>Life comes at you fast.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R94" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">95</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/3/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ĐẠI HỌC HARVARD: KIÊU BINH KHẬT KHÙNG!<br>Hôm nay, Douglas Murray chẩn bệnh Đại học nổi tiếng nhất của Hoa Kỳ: từ thầy đến trò đều là đám kiêu binh khật khùng tưởng mình là cái rốn của vũ trụ mà kỳ thị lẽ phải và ngợi ca khủng bố… <br>Harvard chỉ là mối nhục cho Hoa Kỳ.<br>https://thespectator.com/.../derangement-harvard-university/<br>The derangement of Harvard<br>The university’s best line of defense would be to return to what it is meant to be<br>(Douglas Murray - The Spectator - Tuesday, June 3, 2025)<br>Harvard<br>(Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images)<br>It is 60 years since William F. Buckley said he would “rather be governed by the first 2,000 people in the Boston telephone directory than by the 2,000 people on the faculty of Harvard University.” Yet even the godfather of American conservatism would be surprised at how much more attractive the folks in the phone directory appear today.<br>Harvard has recently been embroiled in a major row with Donald Trump’s administration. It results from the way the university responded to the October 7 attacks in Israel. While the Hamas massacres were still ongoing, more than 30 Harvard University student organizations signed a letter which claimed to hold the “Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.”<br>You might wonder why students at Harvard have such an inflated sense of their own importance that they imagine any “regime” or government would be waiting for their take on things. Stranger still was the students’ apparent belief that Harvard was somehow central to the Israeli war effort. “Harvard out of Occupied Palestine” was one of their demands. You would be hard-pressed to find anyone in the Middle East who believes that their lands are occupied by Harvard University, whoever else they think culpable.<br>Since then, events on campus have become increasingly insane. Jewish students were subjected to assaults, insults and intimidation – all while the university authorities defended it as a “speech” issue. In a set of notorious hearings in front of a congressional committee, the then-president of Harvard, Claudine Gay, insisted that calls for “genocide” against Jews would have to be judged based on their “context.”<br>    Harvard’s best defense would be to return to being a genuinely world-class university cultivating excellence<br>Many observers noted that if it had been black students being chased across the Harvard campus with calls for lynchings then things might have been regarded differently. If foreign students were shown to have participated in such activities, then withdrawing their visas would have been the least of the demands. Yet students at Harvard who were part of a group that attacked their Jewish peers were not only given free rein to do so, but a number of them were recently honored by the university and given further scholarships.<br>The current Trump administration has made Harvard one of the focuses of its attempts to de-radicalize the American university system. It has threatened to freeze tens of millions of dollars of federal subsidies to the university and warned that the Internal Revenue Service would take away the institution’s tax-exempt status. The Department of Homeland Security said in May that it was revoking Harvard’s certification for participating in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program – effectively cutting billions of dollars of further financing.<br>Many Americans will have been surprised to learn that billions of dollars of their taxes have been going toward educating foreign students at Harvard – including the sort of foreign students who use their time to foment revolution in the United States. Harvard started legal proceedings against the government within the day, once again reminding us that the only people who always benefit from this sort of dust-up are members of the legal profession.<br>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in May that the Trump administration is “holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, anti-Semitism and co-ordinating with the Chinese Communist party on its campus.” She went on: “It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. Harvard had plenty of opportunity to do the right thing. It refused.”<br>Harvard and its supporters have done what any university would do, insisting that the cuts threatened by the Trump administration have already affected research into cancer and other diseases. This is a pretty cunning move. Harvard knows what it could do to clean up the mess made by its students and faculty, yet it presents itself as the victim of brutal and inexplicable cuts that threaten the very things that everybody agrees a research university should focus on. It is the playbook the left always uses when financial cuts occur – portraying them as falling hardest on “the most vulnerable.” Campaigners are one step away from proclaiming: “It is such a shame that since the government’s slashing of funding to our egregious and politicized campaigns all the puppy sanctuaries will have to close.”<br>Harvard is betting that it can win the war with Trump. His administration is clearly enjoying the opportunity to sock it to an institution that has become increasingly partisan and political. Yet all the time the obvious correction remains in plain sight.<br>The trouble lies in the fact that Harvard is no longer Harvard, just as so many other institutions in the West are not what outsiders imagine them to be. Harvard’s best line of defense would be to return to what it is meant to be – a genuinely world-class university which prioritizes the cultivation of excellence. It is many years since it or most other higher education institutions in the US have been any such thing. It is one reason why so many students are desperate to enroll in new establishments such as the University of Austin and Ralston College in Savannah.<br>One left-wing author claimed recently that through its attacks on Harvard, the Trump administration “has launched a comprehensive attack on knowledge itself” which “if successful, will undermine Americans’ ability to comprehend the world around us.” We shall see. But for that line of argument to work, the people in what used to be the phone directory would have to be persuaded that Harvard has been an enlightening presence in American life of late, rather than an utterly deranging one.<br>This article was originally published in The Spectator’s July 2025 World edition.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R95" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">96</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/3/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">BÌNH LUẬN TUYỆT DIỆU VỀ MỘT QUÂN LỰC THẦN KỲ!<br>Bernard Henry-Lévy là triết gia nổi danh của Pháp, nhưng quăng hết và lâm trận cho một lý tưởng công bằng rất lạ.

Photo: /Associated Press<br>The Ukrainian operation on Sunday was a coordinated attack on four airports in Russia reaching as deep as Siberia. It neutralized 41 “strategic aircraft” and was a brilliant technical performance.<br>Over more than 18 months, hundreds of drones were smuggled deep into Russia. They were loaded onto civilian trucks with double-bottomed trailers, where they were concealed inside mobile boxes. The tops of those boxes - remotely controlled by operators in Ukraine but connected to the Russian telephone network - opened at the appointed time, allowing the drones to take off. All 41 targets were carefully studied for months by Ukrainian intelligence, and they exploded simultaneously without civilian casualties.<br>This is the Ukrainian equivalent of the September 2024 pager attack in which Israel annihilated nearly all of Hezbollah’s active forces.

At the beginning of the war, there was the Moskva cruiser, the flagship of its fleet, sunk off Odesa by two Ukrainian-made missiles.

They wore red T-shirts bearing the names of hostages seized by Palestinian terrorists over 600 days earlier. Some carried Israeli flags. Walking peacefully in memory and solidarity, they were attacked with fire as a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails created flames as high as a tree. An 88-year-old Holocaust survivor was among the injured. The attacker, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is reported to be an Egyptian national in the country illegally. He now faces murder charges.<br>This third such targeted attack on American Jews in three months confirms a disturbing trend. In April, the home of Pennsylvania’s Jewish governor was firebombed shortly after he hosted a Passover meal. In May, two Israeli embassy staffers were shot dead outside the Capital Jewish Museum. And this weekend, the fire returned – this time in Boulder. This time in broad daylight. This time with the specific intent to incinerate Jewish pensioners gathered to remember kidnapped civilians.<br>At a shooting range in South Florida, I met Jews who on October 7th, 2023 chose to arm themselves for the first time – a story I heard over and over as I met with members of the Jewish community, from lawyers to PR men to moms and dads. They’re training. Securing homes, temples, and schools as if a war has already begun. Because this week, we learnt it has. Had there been a single armed guard among the elderly marchers in Boulder, it’s possible we would be talking today about a foiled terror attack – not about charred flesh and burned lives.<br>There has been some outcry. Officials have condemned the attacks. Statements have been issued. But even as Jews in America are being attacked with increasing regularity, we have not seen the birth of a “Jewish Lives Matter” campaign. No nationwide reckoning. No marches filling the streets. The continued targeting and killing of Jews does not appear to summon the same political urgency or cultural solidarity as other forms of hate. That silence is only broken by the continued death chant of “Free Palestine”.<br>One answer lies in the narrative war unfolding alongside the real one. Just hours before the Boulder attack, major media outlets rushed to report that Israeli tanks had opened fire on starving Palestinians at an aid distribution site in Rafah. The headlines were brutal, the claims unchecked. There were no videos. No forensic evidence. The sources? “Local health officials” and “witnesses” – terms that in Gaza almost always mean Hamas.<br>Hours later, drone footage emerged showing a very different reality: quiet crowds, no gunfire, no chaos. The Israeli footage was not conclusive, but it did raise a simple, devastating question – was there even a mass casualty event? And if there was, what happened? To date, no reliable, verified evidence has surfaced. Yet the narrative had already run its course. Yet more tales of Israeli cruelty had already circled the globe. Jews, once again, had been painted as butchers. Hours later, in Boulder, someone lit a match.<br>Ambassador Mike Huckabee condemned the media’s role in this cycle. “Reckless and irresponsible reporting by major US news outlets,” he said, “are contributing to the antisemitic climate that has resulted in murder… and terror.” These aren’t exaggerations. They’re recognitions of cause and effect. When falsehoods from Hamas mouthpieces are repeated uncritically by CNN, the New York Times, or the Associated Press, they become fuel. Fuel for slogans. Fuel for rage. Fuel, quite literally, for firebombs.<br>Yet while the press was crying massacre, something real was taking place in Gaza – something almost entirely ignored. For the first time since the war began, a new aid distribution model – designed by the US and implemented with Israeli coordination – has begun to work. It bypasses Hamas. It is transparent. And its early results look promising.<br>In just one week of operations, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has distributed nearly six million meals via 87,360 aid boxes. On Sunday alone, one distribution site – SDS1– delivered 1,159,200 meals without a single security incident. No violence. No deaths. No chaos. Prices of basic goods in the area have reportedly dropped by over 35 percent. GHF is now expanding to four more sites, including northern Gaza. This is what actual humanitarianism looks like: structured, verifiable, non-political. And it’s working. Not in theory – in practice.<br>Meanwhile, Hamas has not paid its fighters for months. Its grip on the streets is weakening. Civilians have begun storming Hamas warehouses, some being shot in the process. The tide is turning, but you wouldn’t know it from the headlines. What we get instead is disinformation. One outlet even reported that Israeli naval ships were firing on civilians at a GHF site – a claim so implausible, so grotesque, that it barely merits rebuttal. But it made the rounds. To the Jew-hating media, it “felt true.” And that’s the problem.<br>The slogan “Free Palestine” has, for many, become a kind of moral shorthand. But we must now ask honestly: what does it mean? Increasingly, it is declared while slaughtering Jews. It is shouted outside temples and adorns placards not of peace, but of bloodlust. Like “Allahu Akbar” before it, it has become the cry beneath which Jews are murdered in the street. If the goal is statehood, we are forced to ask: what kind of state? What would it be for? What would it do?<br>Because what we are seeing does not point toward the birth of a liberal democracy. It points toward yet another theocratic terror state. There is no civic program behind the chant. No vision of coexistence. No blueprint for governance. The responsibility is on those who chant and their supporters to tie their movement to the actual goods of statehood – not to murder, not to arson, not to open war on Jews.<br>Central to that war is a news machine that cannot distinguish between elderly Americans at a vigil and a far-off war against terrorists in the Middle East. It is not a news ecosystem, but a propaganda machine. It does not simply mislead – it weaponizes. It invites violence. And increasingly, that violence is coming home. The attack in Boulder should been a national rupture. A moment to step back from the brink. But it won’t be.<br>Something fundamental has shifted. The veil has slipped. American Jews are learning what their coreligionists in Europe and in Israel have known for some time: that hatred of Jews is never defeated, never rational and never far away.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R98" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">99</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/2/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỘT BÀI VÀI KẺ CUỒNG TRUMP RẤT NÊN ĐỌC – ĐỂ HỌC!<br>Tác giả có 25 năm kinh nghiệm với hệ thống NPR bên cánh tả rồi vì nêu vấn đề về chế độ kiểm duyệt nơi đó mà bước ra.

(Photo via Alamy)<br>The working class was pummeled by home prices, healthcare costs, and higher-education expenses.<br>(By Uri Berliner - The Free Press - 06.02.25 - U.S. Politics)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Sometimes it seems as if President Trump’s trade agenda is built upon nothing more than pure ego. The recent buzz among Wall Street traders was the TACO meme - “Trump always chickens out” on tariffs. It got under the president’s skin, and two days later he went ahead and doubled tariffs on imported steel. Cause and effect? In this administration, you can never tell.<br>But beneath the chaos and the antics, MAGA economics are built on a powerful, enduring story: America’s working class - the people who build, drill, and weld, Americans who clock in, get their hands dirty, and wear uniforms at work - have been shafted by globalization and an elitist system of trade that is hastening their doom. It is an emotionally gripping narrative built on a sliver of truth and vast helpings of myth. It ignores the three H’s: home prices, healthcare costs, and higher-education expenses.<br>The myth has the upper hand, driving Trump’s tariffs and threatening to rekindle inflation and needlessly crash the economy. The first-order effect of the myth is straightforward: higher prices on everyday products. Whether tariffs are 10 percent or higher, costs borne by U.S. importers will be passed on to customers. Everything from diapers to T-shirts to cars and washing machines will get more expensive, and those increased costs land more heavily on everyday wage earners, since they spend more of their earnings on goods such as these than the wealthy, who spend more on luxuries like vacations and Pilates classes.<br>Then there is the ill-defined term working class. It is the focus of Trump’s trade policy, but who belongs to America’s working class? Manufacturing workers, who make up only 8 percent of the U.S. workforce? Or does it also include the vastly larger group of not-wealthy workers, from cashiers and nursing assistants to truckers, baristas, and schoolteachers, whose jobs are not connected to trade - or may even benefit from it? Tariffs are a bad deal for them.<br>With the exception of industries vital for national security, such as shipbuilding and semiconductors, upending the American economy for the purpose of landing more factories doesn’t make sense, not when there are persistent labor shortages in manufacturing: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 449,000 unfilled jobs as of March. MAGA nostalgia for the blue-collar glory days of the 1950s overlooks the fact that those factory jobs were dangerous, dirty, and monotonous. They are not as hazardous today, but twenty-first-century Americans aren’t interested in a life on the factory floor.<br>According to a Cato Institute survey, 80 percent of Americans believe it would be good if more Americans worked in factories, but only 25 percent say they would be better off in a factory job. As Dave Chappelle said in 2017, “I want to wear Nikes - I don’t want to make them.”<br>The lack of enthusiasm for factory work is understandable, especially when many workers have more appealing alternatives. Consider other hands-on blue-collar jobs. Employers are offering some high-school students $70,000 a year to work in trades after they graduate. Plumbers, electricians, and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) specialists have jobs that can’t be shipped overseas and might even be immune to artificial intelligence, with salaries that can grow to six figures over time. Plumbers who start as apprentices often become plumbing-company owners. Entrepreneur is a career trajectory that doesn’t exist for hourly factory workers.<br>There is a grim tale told about the American economy over the past several generations: It has all been downhill for the working class, the middle class is vanishing, and American wages have been relentlessly punished by a heartless system of global trade that runs on Chinese workers toiling in near-slave-like conditions.<br>The statistics tell a different story. The median wages of American workers climbed 29 percent from 1979 to 2024, adjusted for inflation. (This period encompasses the latest era of globalization, which accelerated in the early 1990s.) While the share of U.S. households considered middle-income ($35,000 to $100,000) has notably declined - from 55 percent in 1967 to 38 percent in 2023 - that is largely because of movement toward the top of the household income chart, according to economist Mark J. Perry. In 1967, only 13 percent of households were considered high-income ($100,000 or more). By 2023, the share had more than tripled to 41 percent.<br>In the aggregate, this presents an encouraging picture of American capitalism and its promise of upward mobility. But it glosses over developments that have punished the life prospects of working-class (or not-wealthy) Americans. And that is where the story of decline told by the president rings true.<br>Listen to two of the most articulate supporters of President Trump’s trade and economic agenda: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Free Press columnist Batya Ungar-Sargon.<br>Here is Ungar-Sargon in Newsweek: “And then there’s the cost of a middle-class life. While working-class wages are up, the hallmarks of a middle-class life - a home, adequate healthcare, an education, a retirement - have risen astronomically.”<br>Yes, all that is true. Absolutely.<br>And here is Bessent at the Economic Club of New York in March: “If American families aren’t able to afford a home, don’t believe that their children will do better than they are [doing], the American dream is not contingent on cheap baubles from China, it is more than that.”<br>Spot on.<br>What you don’t hear from Bessent or Ungar-Sargon is that these missing building blocks of prosperity - affordable housing, healthcare, and higher education - have nothing to do with trade or globalization. The three H’s are home-brewed, made-in-America, dysfunctional impediments to the American dream.<br>Over the past 40 years, home prices and healthcare costs have risen at around twice the rate of inflation, and higher education has become prohibitively expensive for most families.<br>The accumulated costs of the three H’s can’t be measured just in dollars and cents. They are dream killers, catalysts of disappointment and cynicism about the American project for someone who works hard and can never afford a house, faces bankruptcy over medical bills, or gets crushed by debt for an overpriced degree that is useless in the job market.<br>These daunting obstacles to economic well-being are homegrown and not a byproduct of globalization. They can’t be fixed with the MAGA recipe of trade wars and mass deportations. Progressives aren’t confronting this reality either and, in fact, decades of liberal policies and priorities - from mountains of regulations and permitting requirements that stifle homebuilding to legions of nanny-state administrators at universities - add to the bill for housing and higher ed.<br>The good news is this: Problems that are made in America can be fixed in America, too. In their book Abundance, the influential liberal writers Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson cite the damage done to the housing market by the rulemaking and regulatory obsessions of progressive lawyers and bureaucrats. They also offer practical ideas that encourage building rather than stifling it.<br>Healthcare costs continue to grow as America’s health-insurance colossus staggers on. It has proven immune to serious repair. But the best of the MAHA movement offers something else: a frontal attack on the garbage in the American diet - ultra-processed foods - that contribute to obesity and jack up the bill for the treatment of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.<br>Trust in higher education is plummeting as tuition and other expenses keep climbing. That opens alternatives, ranging from a no-frills revival of classical learning and capturing the teaching benefits of large language models (LLMs) to careers based on apprenticeships that bypass college and employers dropping degree requirements for a wide scope of jobs.<br>America has a remarkably dynamic and adaptable economy. We don’t need to whine about other countries supposedly screwing us over and treating us badly. A true America First agenda should start with squarely facing our homegrown failures.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R99" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">100</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/2/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ĐẦU TUẦN CỦA ĐẦU THÁNG, HÃY ĐỌC DIVIDEND CAFÉ!<br>Rất nên nhức đầu với phân tách của The Bahnsen Group – nhờ vậy mà đỡ bàn!<br>https://thebahnsengroup.com/dividend-cafe/monday-jun-2-2025/?utm_campaign=Dividend%20Cafe&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8ZcgJx3Wx3N0IE7bSMUuDHW4PESoJab1FSfDakKXNcYiuSzDZefqVmEiUPZYXmysmeuPED2hZ80UeyK-MFg6DvTxLle9VXeDp4KarBis5qVKfSAgE&amp;_hsmi=364502448&amp;utm_content=364502448&amp;utm_source=hs_email<br>Not Going Away in May – Dividend Cafe – MONDAY – June 2, 2025<br>Dear Valued Clients and Friends –<br>Live from Newport Beach, we are back with a Monday Dividend Cafe around the horn!<br>Dividend Cafe on Friday gave me the chance to lay out my [politically untenable] thoughts on addressing the national debt fiasco and the need for improved economic growth.  My ten or so ideas are at the written Dividend Cafe here (my favorite), the video here, and the podcast here.<br>Off we go …<br>Market Action<br>* Markets opened down over -100 points today and got down as much as over -400 points before making it all back and closing modestly higher.<br>* The Dow closed up +35 points (+0.08%), with the S&amp;P 500 up +0.41% and the Nasdaq up +0.67%.<br>    So, who had “the month of May being the best month for stocks in 35 years” on their bingo card after the way April went?  Well, all those who have studied history and absorbed the other foolishness of market timing at least knew it was possible, right?  The point is not that “a May reversal rally was inevitable” – because it was not.  <br>The point is that “a May reversal really was possible” – and therefore, trying to time one’s way in and out of Presidential tweets or policy announcements and reversals and such is just utterly futile.<br>*  The ten-year bond yield closed today at 4.44%, up two basis points on the day.<br>*  Top-performing sector for the day: Energy (+1.15%)<br>*  Bottom-performing sector for the day: Industrials (-0.24%) – the only negative sector<br>*  The long bond Japanese yield that had seen its yield jump from 3.3% to over 3.6% is back below 3.2%, once again proving one of my favorite investment truisms: The United States does not have a monopoly on investment know-nothings who hype non-events and then have to take it all back three days later<br>* Credit spreads between BBBs and BBs are now record tight at 90 basis points, perhaps the most non-recessionary call one will find out there.<br>Top News Stories<br>* Ukraine pulled off a massive drone attack on Russian bomber planes yesterday, apparently 18 months in the making.  It is believed the effort took out 41 Russian planes and did over $2 billion in damage.  Russia and Ukraine are supposedly set to meet for [low-level] peace talks in Turkey today.<br>*  Indications are that a long-awaited call between President Trump and President Xi is going to happen this week.<br>*  Eight people were injured, but thank God none killed at a brutal terror attack in Boulder, CO yesterday, as an anti-Israel fanatic launched a flamethrower attack at innocent people.<br>Public Policy<br>*  Last Wednesday evening a lot of noise was made over the Court of International Trade unanimously ruling that the tariffs implemented by the administration using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act were not legal.  If this ruling were to stand it would negate $220 billion of the $260 billion of tariffs that have been enacted thus far.  A federal appeals court subsequently allowed the tariffs to stay in effect for the next couple of weeks while the administration files its appeals.  Sectoral tariffs in auto, pharma, and semiconductor still apply (they used Section 232 “national security” claims for their rationale.<br>* Many are saying that the real issue here will be what the Supreme Court ends up saying in the end.  Others are saying that what matters is the way the administration pivots to use some other pretextual rationale for the tariffs besides the IEEPA (such as using Section 338).  I would say that what most matters is how quickly the administration can get deals ready for announcement that make all of the legal challenges moot. [Hơi khó!]<br>* The Senate Parliamentarian will soon rule on whether or not the Trump tax cuts being made permanent violates the Byrd rule on reconciliation (by extending outside the 10-year window).  If the parliamentarian does rule that way, the Senate will likely vote to circumvent by putting the procedural question up to Senate vote which means it will go through without having to be subject to more ten-year sunsetting, but the Republicans would prefer to not have to go around the parliamentarian (to avoid the precedent it sets).<br>Economic Front<br>*  The President says tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will go up to 50% this week.  More than half of U.S. aluminum demand is served by imports, with Canada being the largest exporter to us.  Expect a major impact to U.S. manufacturers who rely on steel and aluminum as input prices in their manufacturing.  There are 80 jobs where steel is an input and 177 jobs where aluminum is an input, for every one steel and one aluminum production job (h/t Peter Boockvar).  This seems, shall we say, pertinent.<br>*  The May ISM Manufacturing number dropped to a five-month low (48.5) as New Orders drop behind tariff ambiguity.  The biggest cause of Manufacturing weakness?  Export orders!  It turns out that retaliatory tariffs hurt our U.S. exporters significantly.<br>*   Personal Income rose +0.8% in April, higher than expected.<br>*   The 2024-25 Broadway season in New York just took in $1.9 billion across all productions, the highest in Broadway history (surpassing the pre-COVID record from 2019 and up +23% over last year).  I will spend the rest of my life laughing at the “New York is dead” proclamations of 2020-2022, even if the Knicks couldn’t get across the finish line this year.<br>Housing &amp; Mortgage<br>*  Pending home sales collapsed in April, dropping -6.3% on the month, as tariff, economic, and stock market uncertainty more than offset what had been a modest improvement in inventory.<br>Federal Reserve<br>*  The highest odds in the futures market indicate the next Fed rate cut in September and two cuts between now and the end of the year, though with a 30% chance of three cuts.<br>*  All indications are that suspension of the Supplementary Leverage Ratio’s burdensome requirements on how banks count Treasury holdings against their capital requirements is coming this week.  The Fed and the Treasury are supporting dollar-for-credit to capital for Treasuries, a move intended to promote bank ownership of Treasuries and to avoid penalizing banks for holding risk-free assets on their balance sheets (versus other assets that understandably have a different risk weighting).<br>Oil and Energy<br>*  WTI Crude closed at $63.12, up +3.83% on the day.<br>*  One of the major stories in recent years regarding world oil pricing and supply has been the opposite movement between U.S. supply growth and OPEC supply growth.  For three years, the OPEC bloc supply has declined quarter by quarter by quarter while U.S. supply has increased.  This has resulted in a market share shift for OPEC, going from 40% to 36% of global supply.<br>*  The move higher in oil prices today, following the OPEC+ announcement over the weekend of increased production plans, reflects the reality that markets had already priced it in, and then some.  There is also the reality that Russia can claim it is increasing supply all it wants – it may not have the capacity to do so.  Other supply disruptions (Canada, Libya, Iran) all make some of this moot.  It is not a great environment for U.S. producers right now, but the bottom has not fallen out, either.<br>* Midstream did not really participate in last week’s stock market rally, though LNG export names had a good week.  MLPs may finish Q2 negative, marking the first negative quarter for MLPs in three years.<br>Ask TBG<br>“I wanted to ask you today about Japan. I’ve heard you speak often about Japanification, and now there seems to be rumblings in the news about a developing situation over there concerning their bond market. I can’t make sense of it. Something to do with their 40 year bonds and questions about possible Bank of Japan intervention. Of course there is the usual fear based click bait articles with their usual dire warnings.  Is it something for us to be aware of? Are there spillover risks to the U.S. and global economy? Can we add this dynamic to 2025’s year of uncertainty?” ~ D.B.<br>The Japanese long bond sold off a little bit for a few days and has now rallied hard, with the yield even lower now than when the sell-off started.  I think fear and clickbait are a part of it, but also just sheer incompetence from those who have been discussing it.  One of the hardest parts of my job is discerning who is a charlatan from he who is just a plain old moron.  There are lots of both around.<br>On Deck<br>   Dividend Cafe this Friday is going back into graduation mode to offer updated counsel and advice to the young people of our world.  Whether a new high school or college graduate, the focus this Friday is on the practical and real.

And the plunge in solar costs continues to accelerate. In 2023 alone, prices nearly halved.<br>Source: Our World in Data<br>This virtuous cycle is relentless: Lower prices lead to more demand, which leads to more production, which leads to further learning and even lower prices. It’s a beautiful hockey stick curve that underpins solar energy’s disruption.<br>Many people still have an outdated image of solar. But sun power is no longer some hippie dream. It’s about cheap energy, and who doesn’t want a fatter wallet?

The counterintuitive bullish setup we have for solar stocks with the new administration simply adds to the story.<br>    Okay, Stephen… how do I play the solar megatrend?<br>First, let me tell you what not to buy: the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN), the largest solar ETF.<br>TAN holds many of the world’s best solar businesses. It also has a lot of junk.<br>Just like biotech and cyber, solar is a stock picker’s market. Unfortunately, many investors recognize solar is a disruptive megatrend to bet on… but won’t make a dime because they choose the wrong stock.<br>Our investing framework boils down to a simple tool you learned in school: the Venn diagram.<br>As the chart below shows, the first circle in the diagram represents great businesses: companies that consistently grow their revenues and make boatloads of cash.<br>The second circle symbolizes disruptive megatrends: fast-growing, world-changing trends.<br>Where these two circles overlap is the “sweet spot:” great businesses profiting from megatrends. Only stocks that hit the sweet spot in the middle can make it into the Disruption Investor portfolio.<br>Over three decades’ worth of collective investing experience taught my partner Chris Wood and me that if you pick great businesses profiting from disruptive megatrends… the rest takes care of itself.<br>For example, while the TAN ETF fell 4% year-to-date, the solar business we own in our Disruption Investor portfolio has jumped 50%.<br>Stephen McBride<br>Chief Analyst, RiskHedge</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R101" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">102</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/2/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">CÁI DRONE SÁU TRĂM BẮN HẠ PHI CƠ BẢY TỶ!<br>Substack của Jones Ellis viết về cục diện quân sự tại Ukraine: <br>https://substack.news-items.com/p/600-drones...<br>$600 Drones.<br>Destroyed $7 billion worth of Russian aircraft. <br>(John Ellis - Jun 2∙ Preview)             <br>“I can’t do my job without News Items.” Jim Cramer.

A Ukrainian drone attack has destroyed more than 40 Russian planes deep in Russia’s territory, Ukraine’s Security Service said on Sunday, while Moscow pounded Ukraine with missiles and drones just hours before a new round of direct peace talks in Istanbul. The drones hit 41 planes stationed at military airfields on Sunday afternoon, including A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22M aircraft, the official said. Moscow has previously used Tupolev Tu-95 and Tu-22 long-range bombers to launch missiles at Ukraine, while A-50s are used to coordinate targets and detect air defenses and guided missiles. The Security Service of Ukraine said that the operation, which it codenamed “Web”, had destroyed 34% of Russia’s fleet of air missile carriers with damages estimated at $7 billion. The claim could not be independently verified. (Source: apnews.com)<br>2. The Economist: (Yesterday’s) operation is likely to be ranked among the most important raiding actions in modern warfare. According to sources, the mission was 18 months in the making. Russia had been expecting attacks by larger fixed-wing drones at night and closer to the border with Ukraine. The Ukrainians reversed all three variables, launching small drones during the day, and doing so far from the front lines. Ukraine had launched drones from within Russia previously; the difference was the scale and combined nature of the operations.Commentators close to the Ukrainian security services suggest that as many as 150 drones and 300 bombs had been smuggled into Russia for the operations. The quadcopters were apparently built into wooden cabins, loaded onto lorries and then released after the roofs of the cabins were remotely retracted. The drones used Russian mobile-telephone networks to relay their footage back to Ukraine, much of which was released by the gleeful Ukrainians. They also used elements of automated targeting, the accounts claim….<br>Western armed forces are watching closely. For many years they have concentrated their own aircraft at an ever smaller number of air bases, to save money, and have failed to invest in hardened hangars or shelters that could protect against drones and missiles. America’s own strategic bombers are visible in public satellite imagery, sitting in the open. “Imagine, on game-day,” writes Tom Shugart of CNAS, a think-tank in Washington, “containers at railyards, on Chinese-owned container ships in port or offshore, on trucks parked at random properties…s pewing forth thousands of drones that sally forth and at least mission-kill the crown jewels of the [US Air Force].” That, he warns, would be “entirely feasible”.

The margins are so thin that the only certain statement is that it could easily have swung the other way – and for a while last night it appeared that this was indeed the case.What we know is that Poland is split right down the middle, like the US electorate, and elections can, and do, swing either way. What we can say is that this result is an unmitigated disaster for Donald Tusk. Just as we went to press, the Polish media report that Tusk could call a confidence vote this week. He has a majority in parliament. The purpose of the vote is to nip any speculation of early elections in the bud. But Tusk also needs a supportive president to sign his laws, which the incumbent, Andrzej Duda has persistently refused to do. Without the ability to pass important legislation, he may struggle to keep his coalition together for the second part of his four-year term. ...</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R102" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">103</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/2/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">HARVARD và TRUMP – CÁI NÀO TỆ HƠN?<br>Bỉnh bút Gerard Baker của WSJ có tiết mục Free Expression ta nên đọc hàng tuần.

Photo: Mel Musto/Bloomberg News<br>Harvard doesn’t figure in many lists of “party schools” in America. The Cambridge, Mass., weather doesn’t facilitate the kind of sun-drenched Bacchanalia associated with some of the nation’s academically relaxed institutions, and the Ivy League university seems to demand minimum scholastic standards before students advance to weekends of bongs and booze.<br>But according to a new report in the Journal, there is one respect in which Harvard is the top “party” school. It is the favorite academic institution of the Chinese Communist Party.<br>The story says the Chinese leadership regards Harvard as the best training ground for the many thousands of midcareer bureaucrats it sends for executive education and postgraduate studies at U.S. campuses. Alumni include a former vice-president and the country’s top U.S. trade-relations negotiator. Sons and daughters of prominent communist leaders have also studied there.<br>Readers of a certain mindset will smile inwardly when they hear that the college at the pinnacle of America’s higher education is also the place where the elite of America’s principal geopolitical adversary go to learn how to turn their country into the dominant superpower. Revolutionary Marxists committed to the ultimate destruction of Western civilization and American-led capitalism? At Harvard? Of course. Where else would they go?<br>I jest - a little. Harvard’s faculty - in economics, the hard sciences, medicine and mathematics especially - still comprises some of the greatest minds on the planet; the research conducted there remains world-beating, and even in some undergraduate humanities programs I am told it is still possible to get a proper education with a minimum of mandatory indoctrination about decolonization, intergenerational racial equity, exploitative capital or gender studies. Harvard’s status as a magnet for the world’s best and brightest is still beneficial for the U.S. While those communist princelings will mostly go back home and figure out how to destroy us, many of the finest international students attracted to U.S. universities will stay and contribute greatly to American prosperity and welfare.<br>But the knowledge that America’s actual and potential enemies are among the biggest fans of Harvard and other elite U.S. colleges crystallizes many Americans’ conviction that our higher-education system has badly lost its way. It reminds us how central that system’s moral decline has been to the collapse in the American public’s trust in their leadership over the past decade or so.<br>Readers of this column know that I am not an enthusiast for many of President Trump’s policies or methods. Economic self-harm through tariffs, strategic self-harm by undermining alliances, and a blithe disregard for governing norms undermines much of what makes America great.<br>But on higher education, I say bring it on. Mr. Trump is right to have identified the system as having corrupted our sense of national cohesion and purpose and right again to target Harvard as the symbolic and substantive summit of that system.<br>There’s much to dislike in his methodology here too - punishing Harvard by cutting off valuable scientific research funding is a dubious tactic. But I’m also sympathetic to the idea that structural reform is an omelette and some of these institutions are the necessary eggs.<br>The rot in many American universities is so deep and so extensive that a four-year presidency will be nowhere near enough to begin to reverse it through suasion, incentives and dialogue. Ben Sasse argued on these pages last week that the best outcome would be if these threats induced wider change. As Voltaire’s Candide noted, the British used to think it was useful to shoot an admiral from time to time, to encourage the others.<br>The charge sheet has the university dead to rights. Through its admissions process it has actively discriminated against many of the most gifted Americans based on their skin color. Through its hiring practices and teaching it has created an oppressively intolerant monocultural intellectual microclimate. Through its massive inflation of administrative bureaucracy it has enforced and policed these rigidities at great cost, paid for by steep tuition hikes as its $53 billion endowment has made it a hedge fund with a university attached. And through its aggressive pursuit of international students it has built a little elite globalist community of highly privileged like-minded students and academics.<br>It isn’t alone. Last week we were treated to the spectacle of the president of the graduating class at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology using a graduation event to denounce Israel’s “genocide” of Palestinians. To their credit, MIT’s leaders later barred the student from attending the full commencement ceremony. But this is the face of America’s academic institutions - privileged, extremist little Maoists spouting ahistorical drivel and bigoted cant to people who thought they were attending a celebration and got a Nuremberg rally.<br>Discouraging capable students from coming to the U.S. will hurt us, as will depriving valuable academic research of federal funds. But if these actions finally force universities to implement real changes to fix their rot, make them less of a party school for foreign apparatchiks and a playground for radical anti-American ideology, and return them to their status as centers of American excellence, it will be worth it.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R103" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">104</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/2/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">COI CHỪNG CHẾ ĐỘ KIỂM DUYỆT CỦA CÁNH HỮU!<br>Sau bài phân tách của giáo sư Jonathan Turley về chế độ kiểm duyệt của Liên Âu lại được cánh tả Hoa Kỳ (đảng Dân Chủ, chế độ Biden và Hillary Clinton, v.v. ) sử dụng để giới hạn tư tưởng và quyền tự do ngôn luận của cánh hữu, chúng ta hãy xem chủ biên Bari Weiss của The Free Press giới thiệu bài viết của Rod Dreher:<br>Cánh hữu tại Hoa Kỳ, như vài nhóm Thiên Chúa Giáo cực đoan và các nhân vật Tucker Carlson và Candace Owens là thành phần phát xít cực nguy hiểm vì đang mở ra phong trào kỳ thị Do Thái và kiểm soát quyền tự do ngôn luận.

The Trump years have brought with them no shortage of warnings - and many of them have been hyperbolic, dishonest, or downright unhinged.<br>But when the warning is coming from my friend Rod Dreher, it’s worth heeding. Why? Not just because Rod is a perceptive political and cultural thinker and writer, especially on the subject of past and present totalitarianism. But also because Rod would pass the strictest of contemporary conservative purity tests. He’s a regular speaker at National Conservatism conferences. He admires Viktor Orbán. J.D. Vance is a longtime, personal friend of his.<br>And he is very worried about where the American right is headed, as you’ll read below.<br>Rod is ringing the alarm after a trip across America that “shocked me to my core.” He saw “the deep inroads, in such a short period, that right-wing totalitarianism, expressed most often as antisemitism, has made, especially among a growing segment of right-wing males. And unlike so many who point this out, this community is not exotic or foreign to me - this is my world.”<br>Rod’s essay is enormously important. Please read it. And join me and Rod today for a livestream discussion on this subject. It’s for paying subscribers and will begin at 4 p.m. ET. Bring your questions.<br>— Bari Weiss<br>***<br>[This is Rod Dreher]<br>“Do you think wokeness is over, now that President Trump is in power?”<br>I was asked this question recently in Nashville on a tour across the country for screenings of Live Not by Lies, the documentary series based on my 2020 book of the same name. Both the film and the book tell the stories of former Soviet bloc dissidents who resisted Communist totalitarianism, and are disturbed by the totalitarian tendencies in the illiberal ideological movement across the West we came to call wokeness.<br>The experience of Soviet communism gives these people their instinct for danger. But Americans - whether because wokeness called itself “social justice” or because they have had the uniquely American luxury of being on a holiday from history - often don’t see the totalitarian threat.<br>But by the time my book came out we were six months into Covid and after the summer of George Floyd’s killing. By that point what I was describing was undeniable.<br>Americans might not have faced arrest and imprisonment for dissenting from the DEI or gender party line, but fear of losing their jobs, or of having their businesses destroyed and their reputations ruined, can be an effective means of achieving the same goal. By 2020 huge numbers of people in this country dwelled in fear of being fired, canceled, or targeted by ideological mobs for deviating even slightly from the approved orthodoxy.<br>Live Not by Lies helped people make sense of what they were experiencing. It told them that they were not crazy, that something wicked was passing through our society, masquerading as morality and justice. And it gave them advice, via the stories told by men and women who had lived through the “hard” totalitarianism of Soviet rule, for how to resist.<br>By spring 2025, much has changed, not least the man in the White House. What inspired the questioner in Nashville was the sense that wokeness may have peaked, and indeed was in retreat thanks to certain welcome measures taken by the Trump administration.<br>They wanted me, I think, to tell her that everything was going to be fine now.<br>This essay is about why I couldn’t. And why this recent trip across America - to cities and towns in states like New York and Alabama and Tennessee - shocked me to my core.<br>I knew that the left had succumbed to the soft totalitarianism of wokeness. It was part of the reason that I moved to the former Eastern bloc country of Hungary - not to escape wokeness so much as the fact that, through the research for my book, I became fascinated by how these post-totalitarian countries are rebuilding.<br>But I am now witnessing the deep inroads, in such a short period, that right-wing totalitarianism, expressed most often as antisemitism, has made, especially among a growing segment of right-wing males. And unlike so many who point this out, this community is not exotic or foreign to me - this is my world.<br>I don’t want to live in a right-wing totalitarian world any more than I want to live in a left-wing one. Even as wokeness declines, the indicators of a society ripe for totalitarianism are still very much with us. And so I feel the need to raise the alarm.<br>A few anecdotes will tell the story of what’s unfolding on the cultural right.<br>A middle-aged professor at a Christian university in the South whose student body is mostly conservative told me he has been poleaxed by the number of normie white male Christians in his classes who are antisemites. “I stand in front of my class shocked by how many of my guy students are into this stuff,” he told me. “They’re all getting it online. This was not part of the conservative evangelical world I grew up in. Support for Israel was a cultural marker for us. I’m not saying that you have to be on the side of this or that Israeli government policy, but good Lord, antisemitism?”<br>Similarly, a conservative Christian man who attended a screening of my documentary in Washington told me later that his older teenage son, who is on the autism spectrum, had become a hardcore Jew-hater because of the things he had been reading and listening to online, from the right. “All I can do now is trust that his mother and I gave him a good foundation, and hope he makes it through,” the father said.<br>The father was grieved and frightened. He had not raised his son to be like that; he fears that his boy has become possessed, figuratively speaking, by an evil spirit. According to this man, and to all those who talked to me about it, the source of these young males’ radicalization is podcasters and “shitposters.”<br>A white New York executive in her late 20s who is trying to de-radicalize her younger brother explained it to me like this on a walk downtown the day after a Free Press screening of the documentary. So many young men like him - white, heterosexual, and Christian -have grown up in a culture that has told them they are the source of most of the world’s evils, simply by virtue of their unchosen identity. Right-wing radicalism, including antisemitism, because some of their perceived persecutors are Jewish intellectual and cultural figures, speaks to their anger and trauma, and validates their rage.<br>Plus, she added, they find a transgressive thrill in scandalizing both the liberal cultural authorities who exhorted them to hate themselves, and the conservative ones who preferred to stay silent as their sons, brothers, and friends were demonized.<br>It’s like this, she told me: If nearly everything in your culture tells you that you are a piece of shit, not because of anything you believe or have done, but because of who you are, then it’s easy to understand why you will start listening and trusting those who denounce this lie as a lie. But - and this is the key - in a culture that valorizes identity, emotions, and transgression, it is also easy to be seduced by bad actors who weaponize your sense of rage.<br>It is virtually impossible to guard against this without fail. I know this from my own experience.<br>Three years ago, Thomas Achord, then-headmaster of the Christian school in Louisiana my own kids attended, was exposed publicly as a closeted online agitator for racism and antisemitism. He bragged under his pseudonym that he was using his rising influence in the classical school world to quietly turn teenage boys toward white nationalism.<br>As the Christian writer Alastair Roberts documented, Achord was active on social media as “Tulius Aadland,” and co-hosted (under his real name) a podcast with the prominent Christian Nationalist writer Stephen Wolfe. (Roberts noted that it is impossible to say to what extent Wolfe endorsed Aadland’s views; Wolfe said at the time that he did not know that Achord was Tulius, though as Roberts documented, Wolfe at one time followed the Tulius account on Twitter.) A sample of Aadland’s posting:<br>* It is easy to denounce our political enemies. It is much harder to do when our friends and allies embrace wicked ideas, writes Rod Dreher for The Free Press about the Woke or illiberal Right<br>It is easy to denounce our political enemies. It is much harder to do when our friends and allies embrace wicked ideas, writes Rod Dreher for The Free Press about the Woke or illiberal Right<br>* After the school confirmed that Tulius Aadland was Thomas Achord, he was promptly fired. But the revelation was utterly shocking, not least to colleagues of the man who knew him as a mild-mannered, scholarly conservative. After first denying that he was the racist, Jew-hating shitposter, Achord came clean, claiming that he had written those things in a “fugue state.”<br>* In retrospect, there were clues about his true ideology, but nobody in his professional circles picked up on them because it was simply unimaginable to them that a Christian school could harbor such a figure in its midst.<br>We can take nothing for granted.<br>Some on the right insist that this kind of thing is unfortunate, but not a big deal. That such anecdotes are nutpicking and not at all emblematic of what’s going on on the right. They say that there are always bad actors within any movement. They say that old normies like me don’t understand that shitposters say things anonymously online that they don’t really mean - that it’s all joking and irony in the service of having fun freaking out the libs. They say that conservatives like me are too quick to take up the left’s habit of seeing fascists everywhere. That our side should have “no enemies to the right” because that only helps the left.<br>Sometimes they say that this is really just an online phenomenon, and not worth taking seriously.<br>But try standing in front of families who have lost a son or brother to disembodied strangers giving the troubled kid a scapegoat (or several) for understanding his anxieties - and telling them not to worry, that it’s just a phase. Kids will be kids. Had you said that to the mother and father of a teenager entrapped by online trans ideologues in 2014, you would have been a fool offering false hope.<br>Besides, even if it hasn’t yet spread far outside the online community of the “based” (the term used in online right-wing discourse to mean someone who is brave, authentic, and rejects mainstream norms), we are still talking about real people destroying their minds and their souls with racial and religious hatred. And note well that one of the core lessons of the past 25 years of American life is that what starts as an online phenomenon often doesn’t remain one.<br>More personally, I am an Orthodox Christian. So I believe that souls are at stake. And I believe that hating people on the basis of race or ethnicity is a serious sin that can send one to hell.<br>Live Not by Lies is about the soft totalitarianism coming from the left, because for over a decade now, that has been its source. But totalitarian thinking is bad whatever its ideological basis. Even if the left-wing version has lost some of its steam in the post-Biden era, the conditions that brought wokeness about still remain - and right-wing people (especially the young) are just as susceptible to the siren song of ideological certainty, and to the temptation of crushing all who stand in their way.<br>This was also true to some extent in the totalitarian-communist world. In the 1950s, the dissident intellectual Czeslaw Milosz wrote in his testimony, The Captive Mind, that Westerners who think Eastern Europeans submitted to Communism solely out of coercion are mistaken. There were softer reasons too. Said Milosz, “There is an internal longing for harmony and happiness that lies deeper than ordinary fear or the desire to escape misery or physical destruction.”<br>Think what it must be like to be a white boy growing up in a culture that tells you that you are what’s wrong with the world. You are not only demonized by cultural elites and institutions - not because of anything you believe or have done - but because of who you are. Not only that, but you will be denied opportunities for educational and professional advancement, and those power-holders who treat you that way will consider themselves virtuous for having done so. And you see women and non-whites openly embracing their identity groups, while you are told this is off-limits to you.<br>Can you see why such young men might think they can find “harmony and happiness” through solidarity with others who endure the same injustice? This is always why identity politics was dangerous - not simply because it told minorities that the most important thing about them is their identity, but because at the same time it told white men that their whiteness was the most important thing about them.<br>This is how totalitarian movements catch fire.<br>Wokeness may be in retreat on some fronts, but again, the conditions identified by Hannah Arendt that give rise to totalitarianism are present even today. In her 1951 classic The Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt examined social and cultural realities in both the pre–Soviet Russia and pre–Nazi Germany eras, to understand what made those societies susceptible to totalitarian ideologies.<br>Arendt found that by far the most important factor in predicting the emergence of totalitarianism was mass loneliness and social atomization.<br>“What prepares men for totalitarian domination in the nontotalitarian world,” Arendt argued, “is the fact that loneliness, once a borderline experience usually suffered in certain marginal social conditions like old age, has become an everyday experience of the ever-growing masses of our century.”<br>Arendt wrote those words over 60 years ago, when mass society - that is, an industrialized society characterized by large institutions, vast bureaucracies, economies of scale, and mass communication - was still fairly new. Today, we live in a world where many millions of people live trapped in a digital web of their own making. Loneliness and social anxiety is off the charts, especially for the young. We have entered a dystopian culture in which lonely people are having affairs with AI lovers, and in which tech titans talk of improving the lives of the lonely by using AI to invent more “friends” for them.<br>How resistant do you think such a culture will be in the face of totalitarian temptations from the left or the right?<br>Widespread loss of faith in hierarchies and institutions is another clear precursor to totalitarianism, said Arendt. This hardly needs elaboration. Nor does another of Arendt’s warning signs: a desire to transgress for its own sake. When those in power impose a set of absurd laws, policies, and taboos - like the opening scene in the Live Not by Lies documentary, which features a Catholic pro-life activist being arrested by UK police for standing in the vicinity of an abortion clinic silently praying - then it can be thrilling to shout back, “Go to hell, nothing is taboo!”<br>Ideas have consequences. So can memes, shitposting, and ideological fervor unmoored from reason and humanity. As the recent execution of two young Israeli embassy employees in Washington by an alleged Marxist anti-Israel extremist shows, this is not a performative game.<br>The Great Awokening revealed to us how insane the political left was willing to make itself, and to attempt to coerce the rest of us to be, for the sake of upholding its ideological verities. Respect the female penis, bigot, and so forth. It spread with pandemic speed through the left because liberals who knew better were afraid to speak out. With limited exception, they were silent.<br>The right is not immune to this. Right now, too many of us on the right decline to stand up to antisemitism on our own side for the pleasure of seeing those who have unjustly excluded others get a taste of their own bitter medicine.<br>Witness Candace Owens, a highly charismatic right-wing podcaster with millions of followers, publicly doubting whether anyone ever walked on the moon. Elsewhere, she called the 1969 Apollo mission “fake and gay,” and denounced conservative commentator Matt Walsh for believing it really happened.<br>After Owens repeated outrageous blood libels against Jews and characterized Dr. Josef Mengele’s gruesome Auschwitz experiments on prisoners as “bizarre propaganda,” her own father-in-law, a devoutly Christian member of the British House of Lords, publicly distanced himself from her.<br>And yet as of this writing, Candace Owens has 6.9 million followers on X, 4.3 million subscribers to her YouTube channel, and hosts one of the most popular news and political podcasts in America.<br>Meanwhile, even more popular podcasters with audiences numbering in the tens of millions give airtime to people who claim that Winston Churchill was the real villain of World War II. There is nothing wrong with reexamining accepted narratives in light of new evidence, but to believe that the British prime minister was a worse man than the German dictator who launched the global conflagration and murdered more than 12 million?<br>That this is even admitted into consideration by serious, influential right-wing media personalities is hard to understand, and impossible to accept. “Just asking questions” is not a moral disinfectant.<br>Admittedly, it is difficult for a middle-aged conservative like me to keep up with the ideological acceleration within the online right, or to truly understand the shadow worlds of Gen Z activists. But I don’t need to be on TikTok to understand how far and fast this has taken hold. When popular online figures offering crackpot takes like Actually, Churchill was the real villain of World War II find their way onto mainstream podcasts like Joe Rogan’s and Tucker Carlson’s, you know something massive is happening.<br>Despite what many on the left wish to think, this is not merely a matter of white supremacy. Several of this ideology’s most prominent agitators are black celebrities. In recent weeks, black rapper Kanye West released a single called “Heil Hitler.” In the song, West laments his kampf against the courts for taking his children away, and his critics for misunderstanding him. This, he raps, is why he turned to Hitler for succor.<br>Though it’s banned from major streaming platforms, the grotesque song, which features an audio clip of a Hitler speech, has had millions of views. Russell Brand, who has attracted a significant right-wing following, defended West’s song as the work of a provocative truth-teller.<br>“Also, let’s be honest,” tweeted Brand. “The hook is catchy.”<br>When you call out otherwise decent people for platforming vile opinions, they often respond with a jibe slamming cancel culture. Right, I get it. But opposing cancel culture - the reflexive stifling of any speech or expression that violates a taboo - doesn’t oblige us to give a pass to everything evil that can be said simply to prove our free speech bona fides.<br>“It is forbidden to forbid,” was a slogan of the nihilistic French left-wing radicals of the 1968 protests. Now some right-wing figures are saying the same thing. The nihilism remains the same.<br>Writing in The Spectator, Jonathan Sacerdoti astutely observed that the significance of this is not the corruption of Kanye West, “but the cultural atmosphere that has incubated this kind of obscenity at all.” Sacerdoti writes that this is “civilizational erosion”: “We are witnessing not just the degradation of one man, but the corrosion of cultural norms that once seemed immovable.”<br>Sacerdoti’s point is a good one. It is not the case that the masses will listen to West’s obscene song and run out to get their Nazi Party card. Rather, it’s that our culture has fractured and degenerated to the point where transgression is greeted with a shrug.<br>It’s what we do. Arendt identified a culture in which people see acts of raw baseness as liberating, as manifestations of courage, authenticity, and social justice as one that is in real peril of going totalitarian. Whether the basedness is sexual or political is beside the point; the point is the basedness itself. In The Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt wrote of the cultural atmosphere in pre-Nazi Germany and pre-Bolshevik Russia welcoming terrorist acts as a means of “forcing the recognition of one’s existence on the normal strata of society.”<br>She meant actual terrorism, not shocking rhetoric - an important and necessary distinction, but one that does not obviate the valorization of transgression as a politically salutary act. Arendt continues in that passage:<br>    &quot;The members of the elite did not object at all to paying a price, the destruction of civilization, for the fun of seeing how those who had been excluded unjustly in the past forced their way into it. They were not particularly outraged at the monstrous forgeries in historiography of which all totalitarian regimes are guilty and which announce themselves clearly enough in totalitarian propaganda. They had convinced themselves that traditional historiography was a forgery.&quot;<br>Her point is that gatekeepers in both countries were so caught up in the pleasure of watching their opponents scandalized that they failed to notice they were allowing important standards to fall. What’s more, they didn’t care that the outsiders were falsifying history to forge an ideological narrative. Who’s to say that historians can be trusted anyway?<br>The left has done this for years. The New York Times’s phony 1619 Project even won the Pulitzer Prize. Four years ago, Oxford’s Churchill College hosted an academic symposium on its namesake’s legacy, in which one scholar denounced Hitler’s implacable foe as “the perfect embodiment of white supremacy.” Yes, the wartime British leader was a complex man, but he saved the free world. And monstering Churchill is no less vile when it comes from the right.<br>We are not fated to go the way of Germany or Russia.<br>But the history of the last century does not offer us much hope. It is easy to denounce the lies our political enemies live by. It is much harder to do when our own friends, allies, and teenage children embrace different but equally wicked lies. As Solzhenitsyn reminds us, the line between good and evil runs not between political parties, races, or religions, but down the middle of every human heart.<br>The brave dissidents who stood up to Communist totalitarianism concede that most people preferred to keep their heads down and their mouths shut, to avoid trouble. Most of us have that “internal longing for harmony and happiness” identified by Milosz as a cause for rendering our minds captive to lies. For most of us, staying silent is not so much a matter of agreeing with loud extremists of the left or the right as much as it is a matter of just wanting it all to go away.<br>“There always is this fallacious belief: ‘It would not be the same here; here such things are impossible,’ ” wrote Solzhenitsyn. “Alas, all the evil of the twentieth century is possible everywhere on earth.”<br>In America of the twenty-first century, the threat comes not from a foreign evil empire, but Weimar-style, from decadence and weakness within. The real story is not extreme ideological manifestations themselves, but the fact that our culture has become so diseased that it routinely vomits up transgressive, hateful idiocies, and one scarcely blinks anymore. This too shall pass is a therapeutic remedy for our anxieties, but it is not a plan for saving our liberties and our moral sanity.<br>I told my questioner in Nashville that wokeness had not, in fact, peaked, but remained deeply embedded within American institutions. What’s more, I said, it has migrated to the right.<br>The conditions that allowed both forms of totalitarianism to triumph in Germany and Russia remain very much with us. If the United States suffers an economic collapse, as pre-Nazi Germany did, or loses a major war, like Czarist Russia, the seeds of totalitarianism now germinating in our decadent culture will germinate quickly.<br>If we fail to confront this now, wherever it manifests, we cannot later claim that we didn’t see it coming. The Russians of 1917 and the Germans of 1934 had no experience of totalitarianism. What’s going to be our excuse?</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R104" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">105</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/2/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">LIÊN ÂU MUỐN HẠN CHẾ QUYỀN TỰ DO NGÔN LUẬN TẠI HOA KỲ<br>Và Chính quyền Mỹ trả lời ra sao, là bài phân tách hôm nay của giáo sư Jonathan Turley….<br>Liên Âu có một cơ chế gọi là Hội đồng Quản lý Thông tin sai lạc (Disinformation Governance Board) có nhiệm vụ kiểm soát thông tin và thực tế là kiểm duyệt trong các nước thành viên, nhưng cơ chế đó còn đòi kiểm duyệt tư tưởng tại Hoa Kỳ!

Hoa Kỳ phải có phản ứng cụ thể như vậy, Liên Âu mới không là đám kiêu binh đi kiểm duyệt tư tưởng của người khác!<br>https://jonathanturley.org/.../marco-rubio-declares-war.../<br>Marco Rubio Declares War on the Global Censors<br>(Jonathan Turley - Columns, Free Speech, International - June 2, 2025)<br>Below is my column in The Hill on the new policy of Secretary Marco Rubio to deny entry of foreign figures responsible for the censorship of American citizens. It would constitute the first meaningful response to the growing threat of Europe to free speech in the United States. In the very least, it signals that the United States is prepared to fight to preserve this “Indispensable Right.”<br>Here is the column:<br>Winston Churchill once warned that “appeasement is feeding the crocodile, hoping he will eat you last.” When it comes to the crocodile of censorship, history is strewn with defenders who later became digestives. Censorship produces an insatiable appetite for greater and greater speech limits, and today’s censorship supporters often become tomorrow’s censored subjects.<br>This week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stopped feeding the crocodile.<br>On May 28, 2025, Rubio shocked many of our allies by issuing a new visa restriction policy that bars foreign nationals deemed “responsible for censorship of protected expression” in the U.S.<br>The new policy follows a major address by Vice President J.D. Vance in Munich challenging our European allies to end their systematic attacks on free speech. Vance declared, “If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you. Nor, for that matter, is there anything that you can do for the American people that elected me and elected President Trump.”<br>At the time, I called the speech “Churchillian” in drawing a bright line for the free world. Rubio’s action is no less impressive and even more impactful.<br>Europe has faced no consequences for its aggressive efforts at transnational censorship. Indeed, this should not be a fight for the administration alone. Congress should explore reciprocal penalties for foreign governments targeting American companies or citizens for engaging in protected speech.<br>After Vance spoke in Munich, I spoke in Berlin at the World Forum, where European leaders gathered in one of the most strikingly anti-free speech conferences I have attended. This year’s forum embraced the slogan “A New World Order with European Values.”<br>That “new world order” is based on an aggressive anti-free speech platform that has been enforced for years by the European Union. At the heart of this effort is the Digital Services Act, a draconian law that allows for sweeping censorship and speech prosecutions. Most importantly, it has been used by the EU to threaten American corporations for their failure to censor Americans and others on social media sites.<br>After the World Forum, I returned home to warn that this is now an existential war over a right that defines us as a people - the very “Indispensable Right” identified by Justice Louis Brandeis, which is essential for every other right in the Constitution.<br>The irony was crushing. I wrote about how this nation has fought to protect our rights in world wars, yet many in Congress simply shrug or even support the effort as other countries move to make Americans censor other Americans.<br>What was most unnerving about Berlin was how Americans have encouraged Europeans to target their fellow citizens. At the forum was Hillary Clinton who, after Elon Musk purchased Twitter on a pledge to dismantle its massive censorship system, called upon the EU to use the Digital Services Act to force him to resume censorship.<br>Other Americans have appeared before the EU to call upon it to oppose the U.S. Nina Jankowicz, the former head of President Joe Biden’s infamous Disinformation Governance Board, has recently returned to the EU to rally other nations to oppose what she described as “the autocracy, the United States of America.”<br>She warned that the Digital Services Act was under attack, and that the EU had to fight and beat the U.S.: “Do not capitulate. Hold the line.”<br>Former European Commissioner for Internal Markets and Services Thierry Breton even threatened Musk for interviewing Trump before our last presidential election. He told Musk that he was being “monitored” in conducting any interview with now-President Trump.<br>The EU is doubling down on these efforts, including threatening Musk with prosecution and massive confiscatory fines if he does not resume censoring users of X. The penalties are expected to exceed $1 billion.<br>Other countries are following suit. Brazilian Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes shut down X in his entire country over Musk’s refusal to remove political posts. These countries could remotely control speech within the U.S., forcing companies like X to meet the lowest common denominator set by the EU and anti-free speech groups.<br>There are free speech concerns even in such measures designed to protect free speech. This policy should be confined to government officials, particularly EU officials, who are actively seeking to export European censorship systems worldwide. It should not extend to academics or individuals who are part of the growing anti-free speech movement. Free speech itself can counter those voices. These are the same voices that we have heard throughout history, often using the very same terms and claims to silence others.<br>However, Rubio showed Europe that the U.S. would not simply stand by as European censors determined what Americans could say, read, or watch. As the EU threatens companies like X with billion-dollar fines, it is time for the U.S. to treat this as an attack on our citizens from abroad.<br>Franklin Delano Roosevelt put it simply during World War II: “No man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it.”<br>It is time to get serious about the European threat to free speech. And Rubio is doing just that - finally imposing real consequences for censorship. We are not going to defeat censors by yelling at them. Speech alone clearly does not impress them.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R105" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">106</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/2/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">JAMIE DIMON LÀ AI? <br>NGHĨ GÌ VỀ KINH TẾ MỸ?<br>Bản tin ngắn của Reuters:<br>https://www.reuters.com/.../jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon.../...<br>JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon tells Fox Business US debt could cause bond turmoil<br>(By Suzanne McGee and Nupur Anand - Reuters - June 2, 20255:47 AM PDT Updated 3 hours ago)<br>Jamie Dimon (CEO) of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. speaks to the Economic Club of New York<br>Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive officer (CEO) of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Cái khó là làm cho hấp dẫn một cách tự nhiên.]<br>BT150601 -  Bên Kia Màn Khói: Đấu Trí Với Putin <br>Phần Một<br>BT: Chào mừng quý KTG của SGTV đến với c/t BKMK do BT phụ trách, với phần tham dự của chuyên gia kinh tế NXN, để chúng ta cùng tìm hiểu các vấn đề kinh tế và chính trị của thời sự, và sẽ kết thúc với tiết mục văn học nghệ thuật. Kính chào ktg NXN.<br>BT 1: Kính thưa quí KTG, thời sự tuần qua dồn dập với nhiều tin tức nóng bỏng. Trước hết là việc Bắc Kinh công bố cuốn Bạch Thư về Quốc Phòng đề cao sức mạnh biển, sau khi ráo riết xây dựng các đảo nhân tạo trong vùng quần đảo Trường Sa, được cho là nhắm vào mục tiêu quân sự. Rồi tại hội nghị Đối thoại Sanghri La năm nay ở Singapore, giới chức quân sự Bắc Kinh còn hăm dọa có thể thiết lập hệ thống nhận diện phòng không trên khu vực này, khiến dư luận thế giới  càng chờ đợi kết quả gặp gỡ giữa các giới chức HK và Trung Quốc trong khuôn khổ kỳ họp hàng năm được gọi là Đối thoại Chiến lược và Kinh tế, sẽ tiến hành vào cuối Tháng Sáu tại Washington và chuyến thăm Mỹ của Tập Cận Bình vào Tháng 9 sắp tới. <br>Tình hình Á Châu đang căng thẳng như vậy, vào hôm 26 tháng 5 vừa qua, bỗng nhiên Bộ Tư pháp Hoa Kỳ và Thụy Sĩ ra lệnh câu lưu 9 giới chức cao cấp của Liên đoàn Túc cầu Quốc tế, gọi tắt là FIFA, vì tội tham ô, gian lận và rửa tiền trong nhiều thập niên vừa qua. Thế rồi, 4 ngày sau khi tái đắc cử chức vụ Chủ tịch FIFA, hôm mùng hai Tháng sáu, ông Sepp Blatter đột ngột từ chức sau 17 năm điều hành tổ chức này. Điều bất ngờ là khi Chính quyền Thụy Sĩ tống giam các nghi can trong vụ FIFA chờ ngày dẫn độ về Hoa Kỳ để ra tòa, Chính quyền Liên bang Nga lập tức đả kích Hoa Kỳ về quyết định này. Tại sao lại như vậy? Phải chăng vì tổ thức FIFA đã biểu quyết cho tổ chức Giải Vô địch Túc cầu World Cup tại Nga vào năm 2018 sau khi có sự mua chuộc hay hối lộ từ Chính quyền Vladimir Putin của Nga? Khi chuẩn bị chương trình BKMK, Bích Trâm nêu câu hỏi này với chuyên gia kinh tế Nguyễn-Xuân Nghĩa thì ông lại nói đến nhiều biến cố nghiêm trọng khác bên trong nước Nga, <br>Thưa KTG NXN, vụ FIFA có thể gây chấn động trong giới ưa chuộng bộ môn túc cầu, nhưng tại sao Chính quyền Putin lại có vẻ nhạy cảm với vụ án tham nhũng trong tổ chức này? Phải chăng là vì điều mà người ta hay gọi là “có tật giật mình”? Khi chuẩn bị c/t BKMK kỳ này, Bích Trâm trù tính mời ông phân tách chuyện Đông Hải và mưu đồ của TQ thì ông lại trả lời rằng “sự phục thù là một món nên ăn nguội” và mình sẽ còn cơ hội trở lại Đông Á. Thay vào đó, ông cho rằng vị trí Putin đang lung lay! Thưa ông, tại sao vậy?<br>NXN 1: Thưa rằng Trung Quốc có hành động ám muội đã từ nhiều năm, nay họ vừa xác nhận bằng cuốn Bạch Thư Quốc Phòng, nhưng có thành công hay chăng thì sẽ là đề tài của nhiều tháng nhiều năm tới. Cô BT vừa nhắc đến hội nghị gọi là Đối thoại Chiến lược và Kinh tế giữa Hoa Kỳ và Trung Quốc vào cuối tháng này. Sau đó sẽ có Thượng đỉnh năm nay giữa Tổng thống Barack Obama và Chủ tịch Tập Cận Bình. Chúng ta sẽ còn thời gian phả tan màn khói đằng sau những chuyển động ấy, nhất là sẽ phân tích những khó khăn kinh tế dồn dập và tính chất chưa chắc gì là khả thi của chiến lược bành trướng của Bắc Kinh. Trong khi đó, dư luận lại ít chú ý đến tình hình Liên bang Nga và nhiều biến động có thể đang xảy ra trong hệ thống lãnh đạo của Putin, nên tôi xin đề nghị là tạm gác Tầu qua một bên để tìm hiểu về nội tình nước Nga và về sự bồn chồn của Vladimir Putin đến nỗi có phản ứng về vụ tham nhũng trong FIFA.<br>BT 2: Nói về nước Nga, Ngân hàng Thế giới World Bank vừa cập nhật dự báo về tình hình kinh tế Nga theo hướng lạc quan hơn, sau khi Nga bị Tây phương tung ra hai đợt phong tỏa từ năm ngoái về tội chiếm đóng bán đảo Crimea và tấn công xứ Ukraine. Theo World Bank,  nhờ dầu thô lên giá từ 45 đô la tới hơn 60 đô la một thùng, kinh tế của Nga đã bớt suy sụp. Bên cạnh đó, người ta còn thấy Putin đang chiêu dụ chính quyền Hy Lạp và khai thác những khó khăn kinh tế của xứ Ukraine để khuấy đảo Âu Châu. Thưa ktg NXN, ông nghĩ sao về những động thái này của Nga mà cho rằng chế độ của Putin đang lung lay?<br>NXN 2: WB nói rằng năm nay sản lượng kinh tế Nga chỉ sụt 2,7% thay vì sụt 5% như dự đoán và qua năm tới thì chỉ giảm 0,7% mà thôi. Nghĩa là chưa chết mà chỉ hấp hối! Khi đà tăng trưởng giảm sút trong hai quý liền thì người ta gọi đó là “suy trầm”, hay recession. Khi sản lượng không tăng, dù chậm hơn, mà lại sụt xuống số âm thì đấy là suy thoái. Theo World Bank, kinh tế Nga năm nay có đà tăng trưởng là – 2,7% thì vẫn chưa thể gọi là khá được.<br>Nhưng lý do tôi nghĩ rằng chế độ Putin đang có vấn đề nó nằm ở chỗ khác. Trước hết, hôm Thứ Tư mùng ba vừa qua, Chủ tịch Hội đồng Liên bang, tức là Thượng viện Nga, là bà Valentina Matviyenko đã yêu cầu các nghị sĩ Nga phải túc trực để có một khóa họp khẩn cấp vào bất kỳ lúc nào. Thượng viện Nga có 170 Nghị sĩ đại diện cho 85 đơn vị hành chánh gồm 22 nước Cộng hòa và nhiều tỉnh hay đặc khu &#39;oblast&#39; trong Liên bang và Chủ tịch là nhân vật đứng hàng thứ ba trong hệ thống lãnh đạo sau Tổng thống và Thủ tướng. Thượng viện Nga là cơ chế có thẩm quyền về nhiều quyết định như đổ quân, vẽ lại ranh giới, tổ chức bầu cử sớm hoặc đàn hặc và cách chức Tổng thống. Lần trước mà Thượng viện Nga họp phiên bất thường là vào Tháng Ba năm ngoái để bỏ phiếu quyết định sát nhập bán đảo Crimea vào lãnh thổ Nga. Lần này thì vì lý do gì? <br>Ít ai chờ đợi Thượng viện Nga biểu quyết một biện pháp quân sự trừ phi là can dự vào xứ Moldovia, nhưng người ta có nhiều giả thuyết khác về những bất ổn bên trong, kể cả việc thay thế Thủ tướng Dimitri Medvedev và đưa nguyên Bộ trưởng Tài chánh Alexei Kudrin quay trở lại. Thủ tướng Medvedev là con dê tế thần cho Putin vì lãnh trách nhiệm về khủng hoảng kinh tế, nhưng đối thủ của ông là Kudrin trước kia cũng không che giấu việc chống đối Putin về quyết định tấn công Ukraine. Nếu Kudrin trở về tham gia nội các thì đấy cũng là một sự suy yếu của Putin. Ngoài ra, từ ít lâu nay, người ta thấy rằng bên trong hệ thống lãnh đạo của Putin đang có lủng củng và thanh trừng nên Putin không còn mạnh như xưa và có thể bị thay thế trong vài năm nữa.<br>BT 3: Nếu vậy thì xin ktg NXN xóa tan bức màn khói đang che phủ lên hệ thống quyền lực tưởng là rất mạnh của Vladimir Putin. Phải chăng là mọi sự khởi đầu cách nay chừng ba tháng khi ông Putin bất ngờ vắng mặt vào đầu Tháng Ba. Lần đó, ông ta hủy bỏ thượng đỉnh với các lãnh tụ Trung Á và nhiều buổi họp quan trọng khác mà không ai biết vì sao, đi đâu. Người ta đã đồn rằng Putin đi thăm cô bạn gái ở Thụy sĩ vừa sinh con, hoặc Putin lâm trọng bệnh hoặc có thể đã bị đảo chánh. Mãi hai tuần sau ông ta mới tái xuất hiện mà cũng chẳng giải thích lý do… <br>NXN 3: Một số biến cố từ năm 2014 cho thấy hệ thống quyền lực của Putin có thể suy giảm. Song song là mâu thuẫn giữa các phe phái. Những phe phái ấy là gì, gồm có những ai?<br>- Từ năm 1999, khi được Boris Yeltsin đưa lên làm Thủ tướng và cầm đầu tổ chức mật vụ liên bang FSB, là hậu thân của cơ quan KGB, Putin củng cố quyền lực nhờ hậu thuẫn của hai thành phần:  1) bảo vệ an ninh gồm có quân đội và tình báo, thường được gọi là “Siloviki” và 2) thành phần điều hành bộ máy kinh tế gọi là “Civiliki”, đa số xuất thân từ St Petersburg là nơi Putin dựng nghiệp. Với hai phe đó, Putin tăng cường quyền lực và chia chác quyền lợi cho những người thân tín để xây dựng một hệ thống quyền lực khác. Ông kiểm soát báo chí và triệt hạ các tài phiệt Oligarchs có ảnh hưởng mà không tuân phục mình. Ngày nay, hệ thống đó đang lung lay.<br>BT 4: Chúng ta cũng nhớ là vào thời điểm năm 1998 khi nước Nga bị khủng hoảng kinh tế, đồng Rúp rớt giá thê thảm khiến nhà nước vỡ nợ, thì Vladimir Putin đã cầm quyền từ thời đó vì TT Boris Yeltsin nghiện rượu và hết còn minh mẫn. Từ năm 2000 đến 2008, ông Putin đã xây dựng được quyền lực của mình và củng cố vị trí của Liên bang Nga với quyết định tấn công xứ Georgia vào Tháng Tám năm 2008. Từ đó đến 2014 thì Putin đã bành trướng ảnh hưởng của nước Nga và gây khó cho Hoa Kỳ và Âu Châu. Tuy nhiên  thưa ktg NXN, dường như ngày nay Putin đang đi vào thoái trào chứ không mạnh như người ta nghĩ, có phải là như vậy không?<br>NXN 4: Kiến trúc quyền lực của Putin có Bộ Chính trị bên Phủ Tổng thống gồm 9 nhân vật cầm đầu nội các là Thủ tướng Medvedev, cầm đầu Phủ Tổng thống là Sergei Ivanov, bộ máy quân sự là Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Sergei Shoigu, Thị trưởng Moscow Sergei Sobyanin, và các nhân vât lãnh đạo khu vực ngân hàng, thông tin, khoa học và các tập đoàn năng lượng quốc doanh. Putin duy trì quyền lực độc tôn nhờ thế quân bình giữa các phe phái trong Bộ Chính trị đó. Ở vòng ngoài, ông còn có 25 nhân vật cầm đầu các lãnh vực quan trọng. Dưới vị trí độc tôn của Putin, 34 người này vừa cấu kết vừa đấu tranh với nhau để gia tăng ảnh hưởng của phe mình. Và mỗi nhóm lại có cơ quan truyền thông riêng để tác động vào dư luận. Họ có thể làm được như vậy nếu tiếp tục tôn sùng Putin. Nhưng khi thấy Putin yếu thế thì tình trạng đấu tranh phe phái lên tới mức quyết liệt, là điều xảy ra từ năm 2014. Đỉnh cao của Putin là 2014, nay thì có thể xuống dốc và khi xuống thì có thể bị những kẻ thân tín bên trong lật đổ như chuyện đã xảy ra từ thời Xô viết. Thành thử, tin tức có vẻ khả quan về nước Nga hay về mưu lược của Puttin có khi chỉ là màn khói.<br>BT: Qua phần phân tích vừa rồi, chúng ta có cơ hội tìm hiểu thêm về những bí ẩn chính trị của nước Nga từ thời Liên Xô cho tới ngày nay. Xin KTG đừng dời máy, sau phần thông tin thương mại, chương tình BKMK sẽ trở lại và BT yêu cầu KTG NXN trình bày về Chính trị của nước Nga. <br>Break –  Phần Hai<br>BT 5: Chào mừng quí KTG trở lại với BKMK, chủ đề hôm nay là “Đấu trí với Putin”, trong phần đầu của c/t, KTG NXN đã phân tích về hệ thống quyền lực có thể lung lay của Vladimir Putin bên trong Liên bang Nga. Chúng ta có thấy một nét chung của các chế độ độc tài là tình trạng bưng bít thông tin, khiến bên ngoài không thể biết được những gì đã xảy ra. Thí dụ như những vụ tranh đoạt quyền lực của Mao Trạch Đông và kế hoạch sát hại các đồng chí thân tín nhất trong cuộc Cách mạng Văn hóa tại Trung Quốc. Hoặc là những vụ thanh trừng chung quanh Hồ Chí Minh tại miền Bắc trong các năm 1968-1975. Bước qua phần thứ nhì của BKMK, BT sẽ yêu cầu ktg NXN nói về hiện tượng thanh trừng để đoạt quyền tại Nga.<br>Thưa ktg NXN, chúng ta nhớ lại, tới thời Putin thì nước Nga đã có hiến pháp và bầu cử kể từ Tổng thống Boris Yeltsin, vì vậy mà sau hai nhiệm kỳ, ông Putin dù muốn cũng không thể làm Tổng thống sang nhiệm kỳ thứ ba và phải để Thủ tướng Dmitri Medvedev ra tranh cử Tổng thống, trong khi Putin lui về làm Thủ tướng một nhiệm kỳ, nhưng thật ra Putin được cho rằng vẫn đứng sau lưng giật dây Medvedev và nắm hết quyền hành, rồi Putin lại ra tranh cử và đắc cử Tổng thống vào năm 2012. Một đặc tính của các chính thể cộng sản độc tài là không có bầu cử và âm thầm chọn lựa lãnh đạo bên trong đảng độc quyền, thì phải chăng hệ thống dân chủ của nước Nga cũng chỉ là màn khói đậm đặc, mời ông bình luận. <br>NXN 5: Truyện Tiếu lâm Molotov. Trong nhà tù Liên Xô ba tù nhân chính trị hỏi nhau vì sao vào tù. Một:  Vì tao chống Molotov. Hai: Còn tao ủng hộ Molotov. Người thứ ba: hai chú mù hay sao? Tao là Molotov!<br>Sơ lược về diễn tiến “Hậu-Stalin&quot; và cuộc đảo chánh của Nikita Krushchev khi liên kết với trùm mật vụ Lavrenti Beria để loại bỏ Georgy Malenkov khỏi vai trò lãnh đạo đảng rồi lại liên kết với Malenkov để thanh trừng Beria và lên lãnh đạo. Tiếp theo là việc Leonid Brezhnev đảo chánh Kruschev và tranh đoạt quyền lực với Yuri Andropov. Sau này, Andropov củng cố quyền lực của KGB và đưa Mikhail Gorbachov lên lãnh đạo… Nói vắn tắt là toàn những nhân vật chóp bu thanh trừng nhau mà cứ nhân danh cách mạng. Vì vậy, ngày nay người ta mới phải tìm hiểu là chung quanh Putin có những ai và đang tính toán những gì...<br>BT 6: Thưa ông Nghĩa, qua ngần ấy diễn tiến, người bên ngoài chỉ có thể đoán biết bí mật sau màn the từ những chi tiết rất mong manh mơ hồ mà thôi. BT có nghe nói đến bộ môn nghiên cứu Kremlinology (Cẩm Linh học, chuyên nghiên cứu những vấn đề xung quanh điện Cẩm Linh, trung tâm quyền lực nước Nga)  như vậy thì chuyên gia Cẩm Linh Học đã có những suy đoán ra sao về  hiện tình chính trị của Nga Xô hay Liên bang Nga ngày nay?<br>NXN 6: &#39;Phù du học! Ai ngồi bên ai trong rạp Bolshoi? Báo nào của phe nào viết những gì? Thế giới bên ngoài khó biết và thường đoán sai, kể cả và nhất là cơ quan CIA của Mỹ (vài thí dụ!) <br>Nói về chiến lược gia Andrew Marshall của cơ quan “Office of Net Assessment” của Bộ Quốc Phòng Mỹ: Từ năm 1972, dưới thời Richard Nixon, Bộ Quốc phòng Mỹ có một cơ quan rất kín đáo lượng định tình hình thực tế của Hoa Kỳ và thế giới để chuẩn bị chiến lược đối phó. Ông Marshall cầm đầu cơ quan này cho tới đầu năm nay 2015 mới về hưu, ở tuổi 94. Khi ông về hưu thì các tướng lãnh Trung Quốc ăn mừng vì nhân vật rất khiêm nhường và kín đáo này là chiến lược gia qua bảy đời Tổng thống, từ Nixon tới Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush và Obama. Khi còn tại chức, ông không tin vào cách lượng định tình hình Liên Xô của cơ quan CIA và có phương pháp ước lượng riêng, chính xác hơn nhiều nên góp phần quan trọng cho chiến lược thời Reagan đưa tới sự sụp đổ của Liên Xô. Thời ông Bush 43, ông cũng đã đề nghị chiến lược đối phó với Trung Quốc vì dự đóan trước những gì nay đang xảy ra. Nhưng vì vụ khủng bố 9-11 mà Hoa Kỳ lại theo đuổi ưu tiên khác cho tới nay mới nói đến việc chuyển trục về Châu Á.<br>BT 7: Trở về hiện tại, Hiến pháp Nga quy định một nhiệm kỳ Tổng thống là bốn năm. Thế rồi năm 2008, dưới thời TT Medvedev, có lẽ dưới  sự chỉ đạo của Putin thì Hiến pháp được tu chỉnh để quy định một nhiệm kỳ Tổng thống là sáu năm. Nghĩa là sau năm 2012, đến năm 2018, ông Putin còn có thể tái tranh cửa và làm Tổng thống đến năm 2024. Khi nhìn như vậy, người ta thấy Putin đã làm quyền Tổng thống từ năm 1999, ra tranh cử Tổng thống vào năm 2000 và có thể lãnh đạo cho tới 2024, là một phần tư thế kỷ. Thưa ktg NXN, như ông vừa trình bày, tình hình chính trị Nga có thể có đột biên trong vài năm tới và không chắc là Putin đã có thể cầm cự tới năm 2018 chứ chưa nói gì đến tái tranh cử. Như vậy tình hình sẽ biến chuyển ra sao trong thời “Hậu Putin” thưa ông?<br>NXN 7: Quy luật chính trị của Nga là tập quyền mãi mãi và bất ổn mãi mãi, quy luật dân số của Nga là sắc tộc Nga sẽ là thiểu số trên nước Nga. No future trên một vùng đất bát ngát. Loạn to.<br>BT: Quả thật là chuyện nhức đầu nên chắc rằng KTG cũng cần thư giãn! BT xin tạm ngưng chương trình BKMK và sau phần thông tin thương mại sẽ chuyển sang tiết mục văn học nghệ thuật với đề tài là Vũ Trọng Phụng và Kim Dung giữa chúng ta. <br>Break – Phần Ba <br>BT 8: Trong phần cuối của c/t BKMK hôm nay, BT sẽ mời ktg NXN luận bàn về Vũ Trọng Phụng, một nhà văn nổi tiếng của VN vào đầu thế kỷ 20. Giọng văn trào phúng và châm biếm xã hội của VTP khiến nhiều người so sánh ông với Honoré de Balzac của Pháp. Vậy mà trong 60 năm, chế độ cộng sản tại miền Bắc và sau đó trên toàn quốc lại đả kích VTP và cấm lưu hành các tác phẩm của ông cho đến những năm 1989. Một chi tiết lý thú là ngay từ thời đó rồi, tại Hà Nội, Vũ Trọng Phụng đã đả kích việc Stalin thanh trừng các đồng chí mà BKMK vừa nhắc tới. VTP cũng sớm nhìn ra bộ mặt thật của chế độ cộng sản, từ Lenin trở xuống vì vậy mới bị cộng sản thù ghét cho tới gần đây thì mới có nhiều nhà biên khảo nhận chân ra giá trị của VTP. <br>Một số người khác thì nói đến phong cách &quot;tả chân&quot; và yếu tố tình dục trong nhiều tác phẩm của VTP, nổi tiếng nhất thì có cuốn Số Đỏ hay Giông Tố, cuốn Làm Đĩ, cuốn Kỹ Nghệ Lấy Tây. Điều đáng chú ý là dù viết nhiều phóng sự về tệ nạn xã hội tại Hà Thành, VTP được cho là người đạo đức, sống kham khổ, chuẩn mực, phải lao lực để kiếm ăn nuôi gia đình đến nỗi mắc bệnh lao phổi và qua đời lúc mới 27. Mặc dù yểu mệnh vắn số nhưng VTP đã để lại cho hậu thế một khối lượng tác phẩm đồ sộ bao gồm 8 tiểu thuyết, 7 vở kịch, 5 phóng sự dài, nhiều bài báo, và tiểu luận cho đến nay vẫn chưa được tìm thấy hết.<br>Thưa KTG NXN, trong tiểu thuyết Số Đỏ, nhân vật chính, Xuân Tóc Đỏ từ một cậu bé mồ côi nghèo khổ, vô học, sống đầu đường xó chợ, nhưng do gặp vận may và với bản tính nhanh nhẹn láu cá nên được du nhập vào cuộc sống của giới thượng lưu. Ô. NXN đánh giá ra sao về cách VTP dựng nên nhân vật Xuân Tóc Đỏ trong cuốn truyện xuất bản năm 1936? Và theo suy nghĩ của ông, VTPhụng mượn hình ảnh Xuân Tóc Đỏ để nói lên những gì về xã hội VN thời bấy giờ, khi phong trào Âu Hóa đang biển đổi xã hội phong kiến của VN thành nửa Tây nửa Ta? <br>NXN 8: Xung đột cũ mới dưới cái nhìn trào lộng, xuất sắc hơn Pearl Buck của Mỹ và nhiều nhà văn của ta. Cũng nên nhìn ra nét “dâm” trong văn chương Vũ Trọng Phụng.<br>BT 9: Như ktg NXN vừa nhận xét, Vũ Trọng Phụng với ngòi bút châm biếm, trào phúng sâu sắc, đã mượn hình ảnh nhân vật Xuân Tóc Đỏ để tố cáo sự kệch cỡm, giả dối, nhiễu nhương, trụy lạc, chỉ biết chạy theo đồng tiền của xã hội phong kiến VN trên đà Âu hóa, mà trong đó một kẻ hạ lưu, ma cà bông như Xuân Tóc Đỏ, nhưng có thể giúp kẻ khác lừa đảo và kiếm tiền, thì lại được trọng vọng và nhảy lên tầng lớp danh giá, thậm chí lại trở thành anh hùng cứu nước!  Có người cho rằng, nhân vật Xuân Tóc Đỏ không chỉ là tính cách của một cá nhân mà là sự tổng hợp các loại người trong xã hội thối tha, đảo lộn giá trị đó… Ô NXN nghĩ sao về đoạn kết của câu chuyện, khi thành phần tự xưng là “thượng lưu quý tộc” của VN thời bấy giờ đã phải quỳ dưới chân của tên đại bịp Xuân Tóc đỏ? Hắn leo lên nấc thang cuối cùng của danh vọng để cưới vợ đẹp, trở nên một vĩ nhân, diễn thuyết trước đông đảo quần chúng, thậm chí còn được nhận huân chương Bắc đẩu bội tinh nhờ đã tránh được họa chiến tranh cho nước nhà? <br>NXN 9: Xin nói qua về trận tennis ở đoạn kết và sự thông hiểu phi thường của Vụ Trọng Phụng về thời sự khi Mặt Trận Bình Dân gồm đảng Xã Hội và Cộng Sản vừa ra đời bên Pháp vào năm 1936, ba năm trước Thế chiến II. Thời đó, các nước đồng minh e ngại Thái Lan sẽ theo phe Trục là Đức, Ý, Nhật và trận tennis ở Thăng Long lại có vô địch Thái Lan tham dự. Làm sao Vũ Trọng Phụng lại biết cái ngoắt ngoéo ngoại giao chính trị để cho tên vô học mà láu cá là Xuân Tóc Đỏ lại nhường chức vô địch cho đấu thủ Thái Lan nên được dân ta ngợi ca!<br>BT 10: KTG NXN nói về sự thông hiểu thời sự phi thường của VTP, khiến BT nhớ đến việc, GS Peter Zinnoman của Đại học danh giá UC Berkeley, vốn là chuyên gia nghiên cứu về VTP (khiến thậm chí ô được gán biệt danh là một nhà “Phụng học”), gs Zinnoman cho rằng, VTP là một nhà văn lớn, có viễn kiến chính trị, cụ thể là quan điểm chống chủ nghĩa thực dân, chủ nghĩa cộng sản và chủ nghĩa phát xít qua văn chương. <br>Từ Xuân Tóc Đỏ, chúng tôi sẽ chuyển qua nói về một nhân vật nổi bật khác, là Vi Tiểu Bảo trong tiểu thuyết võ hiệp Lộc Đỉnh Ký của Kim Dung, người được đánh giá là viết tiểu thuyết võ hiệp thành công nhất của Tầu, từng làm say mê nhiều triệu độc giả ở miền Nam VN trước 1975. Lộc Đỉnh Ký là tác phẩm võ hiệp cuối cùng của ông và khác với những truyện võ hiệp trước đó của Kim Dung, Lộc Đỉnh ký không phản ảnh cuộc sống của các nhân vật võ lâm với các mâu thuẫn cá nhân hay phe phái, mà phản ảnh đời sống xã hội Trung Hoa ở cuối thế kỷ 17, khi nhà Thanh đang từng bước Hán hóa, với các mâu thuẫn chính trị - văn hóa có thật của lịch sử, và nhân vật chính Vi Tiểu Bảo cũng không theo khuôn mẫu của các nhân vật chính diện trong các truyện trước, không phải là biểu tượng của một anh hùng hảo hán, thậm chí lại xuất thân hèn mọn, chẳng biết cha là ai và võ công chỉ là thuật lẻo mép. Thưa ktg NXN, tại sao ông lại cho rằng hai nhân vật Xuân Tóc Đỏ và Vi Tiểu Bảo có nhiều điểm tương đồng? <br>NXN 10: Vi Tiểu Bảo dưới ngòi bút Kim Dung là kẻ có khả năng giao du với Xuân Tóc Đỏ, sinh trước mà xuất hiện sau, cả hai đều đánh bạt các nhân vật Ba Giai Tú Xuất của dân gian.<br>BT 11: Trong 15 truyện kiếm hiệp của Kim Dung, kể cả truyện ngắn Việt Nữ Kiếm, có nhiều tác phẩm rất nổi tiếng và được dựng thành phim như Cô gái Đồ Long, Tiếu Ngạo Giang Hồ, vv, như vậy thưa ông, tại sao Kim Dung lại đắc ý nhất với bộ Lộc Đỉnh Ký?<br>NXN 11: Chúng ta đã nói đến tranh chấp quyền lực tại Nga tại Tầu, một nhà văn lớn là Kim Dung thì dùng tiểu thuyết võ hiệp với nét châm biếm của Vũ Trọng Phụng để viết về các hài kịch chính trị của nhân thế. Nếu thọ như Kim Dung, Vũ Trọng Phụng sẽ còn để lại cho chúng ta nhiều tác phẩm xuất sắc và nhiều hình tượng tiêu biểu. <br>BT kết: Sau khi trong 2 phần đầu của c/t BKMK hôm nay đã nói về những trận đấu trí quyền lực xoay quanh nhân vật Vladimir Putin của Nga, vừa rồi KTG NXN đã giúp mổ xẻ về hai nhân vật hư cấu trong tiểu thuyết của Vũ Trọng Phụng và Kim Dung, là Xuân Tóc Đỏ và Vi Tiểu Bảo, đều là loại người gian hùng quỷ quyệt, biết lợi dụng thời cuộc để tiến thân. Phải chăng thời đại nào cũng có loại người này?  Mời qúy vị thưởng thức sau đây, trailer của một bộ phim được dựng trên những tác phẩm của Vũ Trọng Phụng, trong đó có “Số Đỏ”.

It was common for young boys to enter monasteries to receive a Tibetan-language education.<br>But several years ago, China barred boys under 18 from joining monasteries, with many sent to Chinese-language boarding schools in what observers say is the latest effort to assimilate Tibetans. During a 2024 visit to a Tibetan area, a top deputy of Chinese leader Xi Jinping said China should “actively guide Tibetan Buddhism to adapt to socialist society.”<br>The change upset Monlam. Children at the boarding schools “started drinking alcohol and smoking,” he said. “That’s how the policy is intended to spoil the child, and after 18, it’s really difficult for a child to be a monk.”<br>Monks walking past shops at dusk.<br>Buddhist monks gather to eat in Karnataka, India.<br>Monlam followed an online group with the Dalai Lama’s teachings—until authorities arrested the group’s founder.

Here’s How to Teach Them.<br>“Having worked in adult education for 20 years, I can tell you the shocking reality: There are very, very few programs that teach adults to read,” writes Volunteer Literacy Project founder Larissa Phillips. (Illustration by The Free Press. Image via Alamy)<br>48 million adults in the U.S. read at or below the third-grade level. Some educators think it’s not possible to teach them. They’re wrong.<br>(By Larissa Phillips - The Free Press - 05.03.25 - Weekend Culture)<br>Listen to Article<br>17 mins<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Marian* was in her late 30s when we first met, and she asked me to help her learn to read. This was in 2007. I was the new-ish supervisor of a tutoring program in Manhattan aimed at adults who were trying to get their GED. Most students came in for help with essay-writing or algebra. But Marian, who had seen her three daughters through high school and into college, wanted to get better at reading.<br>She told me she was at third-grade level. Once we started working together, I discovered it was more like first grade.<br>This isn’t as unusual as you might think. Forty-eight million adults in the U.S. read at or below the third-grade level, and many of them struggle in ways that are almost impossible for a fluent reader to imagine: They can’t order off a menu, check in for a telehealth appointment, or fill out a job application. Low literacy skills correlate heavily with poverty and crime, and are associated with an estimated $2.2 trillion per year of social services, healthcare, and lost wages. This is an issue both sides of the political spectrum would love to address. The question is: How?<br>In April, a bill was introduced in Congress to expand funding for adult education programs. It’s called the WORKS Act—the Adult Education Workforce Opportunity and Reskilling for Knowledge and Success Act—and it would nearly double current funding for programs, to $1.35 billion, by 2029. The bill mentions digital literacy, college advisers for adults, and “foundational skills.” But there is no plan for the most foundational and intractable problem in adult education: teaching grown-ups to read.<br>Having worked in adult education for 20 years now, I can tell you the shocking reality: There are very, very few programs that do this. Federal dollars that were earmarked decades ago for helping adults with low literacy mostly go to programs for adults reading at or above third-grade level, such as citizenship classes or English as a Second Language, or ESL. For the adult who can’t read at all, or can’t read well enough to pass the GED, the options are terrible.<br>I hoped to give Marian the kind of learning experience I’d most loved as a child, independent and without a dull, plodding teacher. I would find some rich literature, show her how to sound out the words, and then we would just, well, read.<br>One of my students, Natasha Autar, was confronted with this fact a few years ago. Back in her home country of Guyana, she never had the opportunity to go to school—a fact she bitterly regrets. Natasha came to the U.S. in her early 20s and slowly cobbled together basic reading skills by memorizing words and using context clues to make guesses. She watched videos on YouTube so assiduously that she was able to pass the math and science sections of the GED, but to pass the reading and writing sections, she knew she needed help. She applied to numerous literacy programs in New York City—only to be turned away by all of them. “They said my scores were too low,” Natasha told me.<br>Eventually, she convinced the director of an adult education program in Manhattan—one that had initially turned her away because she “got a zero on the test”—to accept her as a student. “They made a zero-level class just for me.” But when I asked how she was taught, Natasha told me: “The teacher was very nice, but there was no spelling. There was nothing about the sounds. He just read to me.”<br>Herein lies the other problem. Even adult education programs that do teach reading tend to do it completely ineffectively. In my two-decade career in this field, I have heard of only a very few literacy centers that teach reading using methods that are actually proven to work—and that’s because of a conflict that plagues American education. It is, fundamentally, a battle between a progressive mindset and a traditional one. The former prioritizes the student’s inclinations, the joy of learning, and the teacher’s intuition. The latter wants strictness, structure, and an evidence-based curriculum.<br>I used to favor the intuitive method; I thought it was more creative, more humane. But I learned the hard way: When it comes to teaching reading, you need rules, feedback, and a plan.<br>To understand why reading education is such a mess, we have to go back a hundred years. Before the Progressive Era, students were taught to read via the phonetic code; they learned that letters on a page represent sounds, and that sounds can be blended together to make words. The genius of this method is that it allows you to read any word, even Italian ones or nonsense ones in Dr. Seuss’s books. But the academic innovators of the 20th century considered this method dry, and they started coming up with new methods. Instead of bothering with the dreary task of learning the phonetic code, they suggested, students could jump right into the joy of reading by just memorizing whole words.<br>This philosophy gave us the look-say method, exemplified by the 1940s Dick and Jane books, in which kids would encounter the same word again and again, memorize its shape, and then be able to read it. The sentences, such as “Look, Jane. Look, look,” weren’t exactly scintillating. But the more pressing issue was that it’s not possible to memorize enough words to become even a minimally fluent reader.<br>The look-say method didn’t last, but the whole-word approach to reading morphed into a new incarnation: whole language. This 1980s philosophy dictated that the teacher should take a back seat, minimizing explicit instruction and simply immersing the student in rich language and literature. The idea was that learning to read was as natural as learning to speak.<br>In 1987, California adopted the whole-language method as the primary mode of reading instruction. Some school principals even banned the explicit teaching of phonics, and books about phonics became contraband. By 1993, California was turning out the second-lowest reading scores in the nation. (The lowest was Mississippi.) Eventually, whole language was discredited by the evidence.<br>In its place came a successor: balanced literacy. Meant to be a middle ground between phonics and the whole-word approach, it quickly devolved into teaching children to guess words by using the first letter, context clues, or even illustrations. In recent years, balanced literacy has also been discredited, in large part due to journalist Emily Hanford and her award-winning investigative podcast series, Sold a Story, which in 2022 began unpacking how little evidence there was for this method.<br>By now, there is a vast body of research, often called “the science of reading,” which makes the case that an effective reading curriculum is sequential, methodical, and directly taught. It explicitly teaches the phonetic code—as well as vocabulary, word parts, and other elements required for fluent reading. And the science of reading is steadily gaining ground in children’s classrooms, although parents and educators are still fighting to stamp out balanced literacy. Whole language? It is a true relic of the past, something no serious educator would use to teach a child to read.<br>Unfortunately, the revolution hasn’t come to adult education.<br>It’s painful to remember the things I asked students like Marian to do in the early years. When I began teaching adults, I’d had no training and knew next to nothing about the debates going on in the world of reading instruction. Also, I wholeheartedly believed in the progressive approach to education. I disliked tests and textbooks. The idea of the teacher wielding knowledge and power over the passive student was anathema to me, an approach better suited to Republicans and authoritarians and nuns.<br>I hoped to give Marian the kind of learning experience I’d most loved as a child, independent and without a dull, plodding teacher. I would find some rich literature, show her how to sound out the words, and then we would just, well, read. With some gentle prompting, literacy would just happen, like a lightning bolt of consciousness. Isn’t that how I’d learned?<br>But right away there were problems. First: the materials. Everything I could find for beginning readers was for children: silly cartoons, or big illustrated picture books, obviously meant for a preschool audience. It felt demeaning to use them to teach an adult. I dug around to find something appropriate and came across a beautiful children’s book, Wilma Unlimited, about Wilma Rudolph, a black American sprinter who overcame polio and poverty to become the fastest woman in the world. It was language-rich and inspiring and seemed a good-enough fit.<br>Marian stiffened slightly when she saw the book, which was so obviously meant for children. But she was here to work, and she would grapple—that night and every other night she came to class—with anything I suggested.<br>Here’s the thing about children’s books, though: They’re not meant for teaching reading. They are meant for adults to read to children. The vocabulary is usually sophisticated, not ideal for a beginner still learning how to tease apart letters and sounds.<br>I didn’t know this.<br>I was inspired by these students who returned to my classes. Some wanted to read the Bible, or read to their children, or finally break this generational curse. Many have told me they want to learn to read before they die.<br>We couldn’t even get through the first sentence. “No one expected such a tiny baby to survive. . .” Marian read the first word, and then couldn’t read one. I read it aloud to her. Then I broke down expected into syllables, tapping each part of the word as I slowly sounded it out. It didn’t help—she couldn’t hear how the syllables came together to make the word. I told her what it was. She repeated it. I had to tell her what the next few words were, too, then she started panicking and rushing, and then she couldn’t read the word to, which I was pretty sure she knew by sight. I could feel her mood darkening next to me. I felt cruel and was mortified that I had led her into this situation.<br>Reading wasn’t just happening.<br>Unwittingly, I was basing my teaching on the discredited theory of whole language. The ironic thing is that, at the outset, this felt like the compassionate thing to do. Most teachers love reading, and we want to share that love with our students; drilling phonics, correcting pronunciation, giving tests, saying, “No, try again” feels mean—especially when we’re teaching adults whose inability to read is often the result of brutal societal factors. But were my teaching methods really empathetic?<br>With students like Marian I began to realize: perhaps not.<br>It was clear I needed help. As I started looking for guidance, I discovered other adult educators were stuck in the same bind. Trying to be compassionate, they were using methods that were ineffective at best and, at worst, harmful.<br>The director of an adult education library program in the Hudson Valley of New York told me, for instance: “We don’t use a curriculum. The students choose their own materials.” I thought I must have misunderstood her program’s aim. Her students couldn’t read. Surely she wasn’t asking them to design their own instructional path? “Oh yes,” she confirmed. “They’re adults. We’re not going to make those choices for them.”<br>Perhaps the worst thing is, when methods like this don’t work, the blame is often placed on the student. Program directors have told me that adults with low literacy skills don’t work hard enough in class or quit too soon. “They never last more than six months,” one teacher told me.<br>Some believers in the whole-language approach are skeptical that adults are even able to learn. The director of the local chapter of a highly touted national literacy program—whose website boasts to this day that it uses a “learner-centered whole-language approach” to teach reading to adults—told me: “You can’t teach them if they read below the fourth-grade level.”<br>An elderly warhorse of a teacher once summed it up to me with a weary sigh: “I don’t think anyone knows how to teach reading to adults.”<br>I was desperate to figure it out. I was inspired by these students who returned to my classes, night after night, convinced that they could learn, if I could just figure out how to teach them. They wanted to pass the GED, or get better jobs. Some wanted to read the Bible, or read to their children, or finally break this generational curse. Or they just wanted to crack this code that has plagued them their entire lives. “I want this damn monkey off my back,” one man in his 60s told me. Many have told me they want to learn to read before they die.<br>Finally, I thought to look into the world of children’s reading instruction—where the phonics-based approach had been lately experiencing a renaissance. I learned how to teach reading using this system of sounding out letters, then syllables, then words. I brought this knowledge and these materials back to the students, and we got to work. It was incredible. We used alphabet boards, flash cards, and drills. When they struggled, I now had explicit strategies to help them. I learned to correct, cajole, and insist that they master each concept. They read passages that aligned exactly with the sounds they’d just practiced—passages that used only short vowels, for example. We worked on vocabulary, practiced summarizing texts, and talked about what we’d just read.<br>Finally enrolled in a program that directly teaches the sound-symbol relationship—that is, phonics—most students went through a period of shock and even anger, asking: “Why didn’t anyone ever teach me like this?” Virtually all of them were under the same impression, expressed by one of my first reading students, a young man named Stefan, who told me: “I thought you just had to memorize all the words.”<br>Now, Natasha regularly comes to her tutoring session with stories about how she is able to sound out complex words by going one syllable at a time. “Did you know this method really works?” she’ll say, and then give another example. In her job in a nursing home, she has been able to read the names of various medicines and medical conditions, even with the pressure of being in front of her supervisors. Stefan came in one day and tried hard not to smile as he told us, “My uncle left me a note, and I read it.” On another occasion, he realized suddenly that he was able to read the street signs around him. “Words jump out at me wherever I go,” Stefan said. Another young man got a new job with better pay, closer to home, where he was given a checklist of tasks every day. He would take the checklist into the bathroom and work his way through it, one syllable at a time.<br>In the years I’ve been teaching students like Natasha, Stefan, and Marian, I’ve learned plenty, too. I’ve experimented with techniques, dropped a few, invented some others. Eventually I created materials, writing stories at the Cat in the Hat level, but about adults that my students could relate to. In the end, I wrote an entire curriculum, and set up a nonprofit, the Volunteer Literacy Project, which shares resources with anyone who wants to learn how to teach adults to read.<br>The whole experience knocked me off my ideological pedestal. The most effective way to help my students, I realized, was to radically diverge from the progressive path I’d traveled my entire life. I am now as close to a traditional schoolmaster as I ever could have imagined: I drill. I test. I say things like, “No, that’s wrong. Try again.” There is a correct answer, and I want it.<br>It turns out the students want that, too.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R110" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">111</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/1/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ĐẾN LƯỢT DÂN NGA THAN THỞ: <br>BÂY GIỜ TA CŨNG BỊ CHIẾN TRANH!<br>Bản tin của RFE/RL (mục Thực trạng.Siberia) tường thuật từ Siberia, bên trong Liên bang Nga, khi dân Nga nếm mùi chiến tranh vì bị drone của xứ Ukraine (ở cách đó bốn ngàn cây số), sau khi Ukraine bị Putin tấn công hơn ba năm qua.<br>https://www.rferl.org/.../russia-ukraine.../33431082.html<br>&#39;Now The War Has Reached Us Too,&#39; Russians Far From Ukraine Say After Drone Attacks<br>By RFE/RL&#39;s Siberia.Realities - June 02, 2025 00:01 CET<br>Ukraine says it hit dozens of long-range bomber aircraft across Russia with drones that were smuggled in wooden shipping crates carried on truck beds into the country and then launched from nearby locations.<br>For more than three years, most of Russia has viewed the war sparked by the Kremlin&#39;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine from afar.<br>Now, some say, following an audacious attack by Ukraine that saw hoards of drones smuggled into Russia and then deployed on June 1 to wipe out dozens of long-range bombers, it has arrived on their doorstep.<br>In the Irkutsk, Murmansk, Ryazan, and Ivanovo regions, drones struck air bases, shocking Russian authorities and citizens.<br>&quot;It was a fiery hell,&quot; residents of the Irkutsk region told RFE/RL&#39;s Siberia Realities.<br>In Siberia, some 4,000 km away, residents appeared to be shaken.<br>&quot;Now the war has reached us too,&quot; residents told Siberia Realities.<br>Ukraine&#39;s Secret Service (SBU) said dozens of long-range bomber aircraft across Russia were attacked with drones that were smuggled in wooden shipping crates carried on truck beds into the country and then launched from nearby locations.<br>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attacks the &quot;absolutely brilliant outcome&quot; of an operation that had taken more than a year and half to prepare.<br>According to eyewitnesses, the drones flew out of a truck that stopped on the R-255 &quot;Siberia&quot; highway.

X.com<br>MATTHEW RICE<br>(By MATTHEW RICE - NY Sun - Published: Jun. 1, 2025 06:36 PM ET<br>Updated: Jun. 1, 2025 07:04 PM ET)<br>The FBI says it is investigating a violent assault on individuals in Colorado who were honoring the Gaza hostages as a possible act of terror. The chief of the Boulder police department says “multiple” people were left burned in an attack by what eyewitnesses said was a “self-proclaimed Palestinian.” <br>The attack began just before 1:30 p.m. local time at Boulder, Colorado, outside the county courthouse. At the time, a small group was honoring the hostages still being held by Hamas at Gaza. The weekly Sunday walk to honor those detained has been going on every weekend since October 7, 2023. <br>“When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries,” the Boulder police chief, Steve Redfearn, said at a press conference after the suspect was taken into custody. <br>“A suspect was pointed out to our officers on the scene. Our officers immediately encountered that suspect, who was taken into custody without incident,” Mr. Redfearn said. <br>The police did not disclose the suspect’s identity. Mr. Redfearn said he had been taken to the hospital with minor injuries. <br>“There’s a lot more we’re investigating right now before I’m able to release information on that person,” Mr. Redfearn added. He says they are investigating a “vehicle of interest.”<br>The police chief confirmed that “dozens and dozens” of law enforcement from the local, state, and federal levels were on the scene. An evacuation area has been set up downtown. <br>The deputy director of the FBI, Dan Bongino, said on X that the attack is now being investigated as a potential act of terror. <br>“FBI personnel are on the scene in Boulder, Colorado, along with local law enforcement,” Mr. Bongino says. “We are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence. All of the necessary assets will be dedicated to this investigation.”<br>Mr. Redfearn said that the suspect was an adult male, but offered no other identifying information. Video of the aftermath of the assault quickly began circulating online, including eyewitness accounts. <br>One X user who claims to have been at the site of the attack when the burnings began says the man was a “Self proclaimed Palestinian” who was “lighting people on fire with gasoline (from gardening tool) and throwing Molotov cocktails. Burned about 6 people aged mostly over 70.”<br>In one video of the alleged attacker, he is seen holding two bottles filled with clear liquid. Inside the bottles are what appear to be rags. The ground near the man was set on fire, as one victim laid motionless on the sidewalk as others administered first aid. <br>“How many children have you killed?” the alleged attacker is seen screaming at the crowd. When a police officer approaches the man with his weapon drawn, the suspect lies down before being taken into custody.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R112" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">113</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/1/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">KHỦNG BỐ TẠI BOULDER – COLORADO<br>Tin tổng hợp của Wall Street Journal:<br>https://www.wsj.com/.../fbi-investigating-possible-terror...<br>FBI Investigates Possible Terror Attack in Boulder, Colorado<br>Multiple people, including some in a pro-Israel group, were injured in the Sunday incident in a crowded pedestrian mall<br>(By Ginger Adams Otis - WSJ - Updated June 1, 2025 7:38 pm ET)<br>Law enforcement officials investigating an attack on a mall in Boulder, Colo.<br>Law-enforcement officials prepare to investigate the attack on a pedestrian mall in Boulder, Colo.

The campaign, known as Operation Spider’s Web, marks a stunning escalation in Ukraine’s asymmetric warfare strategy - and what some analysts are calling a historic reversal that could tilt the odds in peace negotiations against the larger aggressor.<br>The mission - overseen by Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) and personally authorized by President Volodymyr Zelensky - reportedly took more than 18 months to prepare. SBU operatives smuggled first-person-view drones into Russia hidden inside wooden mobile cabins mounted on civilian cargo trucks. When activated remotely, the trucks’ roofs opened and the drones launched directly at parked Russian bombers.<br>“This was our most long-range operation,” Zelensky posted Sunday on X, noting the assault involved only Ukrainian forces. “One year, six months, and nine days from the start of planning to execution. These are Ukrainian actions that will undoubtedly be in history books.”<br>The strikes hit four airbases far from the front lines: Belaya airbase in Irkutsk Oblast, Olenya in Murmansk near the Arctic Circle, Dyagilevo in Ryazan Oblast, and Ivanovo in central Russia.<br>According to Ukrainian intelligence sources cited by the BBC, the damaged assets include Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 nuclear-capable strategic bombers, as well as an A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft. The total estimated damage exceeds $2 billion USD.<br>Footage posted on Russian and Ukrainian Telegram channels showed plumes of smoke rising from the affected airbases. In one widely circulated clip, a bystander can be heard saying drones had launched from “a Kamaz truck near a petrol station.” Russian state media acknowledged strikes across five regions and labeled the attacks “a terrorist act.” However, prominent Russian military bloggers confirmed the loss of aircraft and critical infrastructure, including fuel storage depots.<br>Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev confirmed the Belaya strike, stating the drones had been launched from a civilian truck and that the situation was “under control” with no casualties reported.<br>SBU officials told the BBC that Spider’s Web was a “logistical and operational breakthrough,” describing a multi-stage smuggling effort that first inserted the FPV drones into Russia, followed later by mobile launch platforms. “Once on Russian territory, the drones were hidden under the roofs of these cabins,” one source said. “At the right moment, the roofs were remotely opened, and the drones took off.”<br>Zelensky credited SBU chief General Vasyl Maliuk with executing the unprecedented strike. “I thanked General Maliuk for this success of Ukraine,” Zelensky said. “We are doing everything to make Russia feel the need to end this war. Russia started this war. Russia must end it.”<br>The operation comes amid intensifying cross-border attacks by both sides. Hours earlier, a Russian missile barrage killed 12 Ukrainian soldiers and injured over 60 at a training base. Ukrainian air defenses responded by reportedly downing 385 Russian aerial targets across multiple regions.<br>The timing of the drone assault - just ahead of a second round of peace talks in Istanbul on Monday - appears aimed at pressuring Moscow. Zelensky has demanded a “complete and unconditional ceasefire,” while Russian officials are calling for a halt to Western arms transfers to Ukraine, a condition Kyiv rejects.<br>“These strikes are a clear and effective guarantee of Ukraine’s security,” Zelensky said. “Glory to Ukraine.”<br>Military analyst Tom Shugart noted the implications of the strike could extend far beyond the European theater, warning that Ukraine’s use of covert drone launches deep inside enemy territory raises implications for China’s global trade and access to Western ports.<br>“A reminder, given today’s Ukrainian drone strikes, that it is becoming borderline-insane that we routinely allow ships owned and operated by DoD-designated Chinese military companies to sit in our ports with thousands of containers onboard and under their control,” Shugart posted Sunday afternoon, referencing mounting U.S. tensions with China over its aggression toward Taiwan.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R115" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">116</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">6/1/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">NƯỚC MỸ VẪN BỆNH HOẠN!<br>Báo The Telegraph của Anh chú ý đến tình hình Hoa Kỳ nên có tiết mục Daily Digest, mỗi ngày giới thiệu dăm ba tin tức về nước Mỹ. Trong số tin nên đọc hôm nay có vụ ‘Gia đình Manson xin giảm án’. <br>Đa số quý vị có thể không biết gì về một hiện tượng bệnh hoạn của xã hội Hoa Kỳ nên xin có vài hàng về bối cảnh. Như sau:<br>Sinh năm 1934 tại California, Charles Manson là loại nghệ sĩ thiếu tài mà thừa bệnh điên. Bị ban &quot;the Beattles&quot; mê hoặc với một bài ngợi ca sự tàn sát về chủng tộc (“Helter Skelter”), hắn lập ra một giáo phái cuồng tín - và kêu gọi cuồng sát. Thời ấy, Tây phương còn ngu xuẩn nên có phong trào “hippy’ với lũ ranh con sơn vẽ trên mặt và kêu gọi yêu nhau hơn gây chiến. Nhưng cũng trong trào lưu đó, có đứa kêu gọi leo lên đỉnh cao, là giết người! <br>Và thành công vì lắm đứa tin theo giáo chủ Manson. Chúng tự xưng là “Gia đình Manson”.<br>Năm 1969, ba thiếu nữ trong &#39;gia đình&#39; bệnh hoạn đó mở ra bốn cuộc tàn sát vào Tháng Bảy Tháng Tám làm chín người mất mạng. Vụ thảm sát nổi tiếng nhất là suốt hai đêm có bảy nạn nhân, kể cả diễn viên Sharon Tate, phu nhân của đạo diễn Roman Polansky, mới 26 tuổi đã chết với cái thai. Và lũ cuồng sát còn lấy máu ca tụng hành vi bệnh hoạn của chúng. <br>Năm 1971, Charles Manson bị kết án là kẻ chủ mưu do ý thức hệ sát nhân dù tay không nhúng máu, rồi chết vì bệnh trong tù vào năm 2017. Nhưng ba con ranh giết người thì vào tù California từ năm 1970 - mà thoát tử hình vì California bỏ lệnh tử hình từ 1972. <br>Năm 2023, một đứa được ra khỏi tù để hưởng án treo. Giờ đây, con trọng phạm đã đâm một nạn nhân bằng 28 nhát dao và than mỏi tay, đang vận động để cũng được giảm thành án treo - mà gặp sự phản đối của gia đình Sharon Tate. <br>Bài viết trên The Telegraph kể lại chuyện của mấy đứa làm chúng ta nhớ: Xã hội Hoa Kỳ hay gặp bệnh điên!<br>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/.../manson-family-member.../...<br>‘Manson Family’ member who smeared blood on walls recommended for parole<br>Family of victim Sharon Tate says Patricia Krenwinkel, 77, has shown ‘absolutely no remorse’ and should stay in prison<br>Patricia Krenwinkel (centre) with two other members of the &#39;Manson Family&#39;, Susan Atkins (L) and Leslie Van Houten, seen walking to court in 1970<br>Patricia Krenwinkel (centre) with two other members of the ‘Manson Family’, Susan Atkins (L) and Leslie Van Houten, seen walking to court for their trial in 1970 Credit: George Brich<br>By Iona Cleave - The Telegraph - 01 June 2025 3:52pm BST)<br>A Manson cult murderer who killed the actress Sharon Tate and smeared blood on the walls of her home has been recommended for parole, sparking anger from the actress’s family.<br>Patricia Krenwinkel, 77, the longest-serving female inmate in California, is one of two remaining so-called “Manson Family” members still in prison.<br>In 1971, she was convicted of the murders of seven people, including the actress Sharon Tate, during a two-night rampage that shocked America in 1969.<br>Krenwinkel was sentenced to death, but her sentence was reduced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after California abolished the death penalty in 1972.<br>Patricia Krenwinkel in 2020<br>Krenwinkel in 2020<br>Incarcerated at the California Institution for Women for 54 years, Krenwinkel did not speak at the four-hour hearing on Friday. <br>Tate’s family members, meanwhile, argued she should stay in prison.<br>“For years, this woman laughed about the murders in court and showed absolutely no remorse at all,” wrote Debra Tate, the younger sister of Sharon Tate, in an online petition on Friday.<br>“Society cannot allow this serial killer, who committed such horrible, gruesome, random killings, back out.”<br>It is the 16th time that Krenwinkel has appeared before a parole board, and the second time she was recommended. The first was in 2022, but the decision was overruled by Gavin Newsom, California’s governor. Mr Newsom wrote at the time that Krenwinkel “still poses an unreasonable danger to society if paroled at this time”.<br>Charles Manson did not personally kill the seven victims, but he was found guilty of ordering their murders and died in prison in 2017 Credit: AP Photo/File<br>The governor could reject the parole board’s decision once again or send it back for further review.<br>“At her parole hearing, Ms. Krenwinkel accepted responsibility for her direct crimes, yet she continued to shift disproportionate blame to Mr. Manson for decisions and conduct within her control,” Mr Newsom wrote.<br>Tate, the 26-year-old wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski, was one of seven victims of the grisly killings by the Manson cult on the nights of August 9 and 10, 1969.<br>Eight months pregnant, Tate was stabbed and shot to death at her Beverly Hills home with four friends, including coffee heiress Abigail Folger, hair stylist Thomas Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski and Steven Earl Parent.

SẼ THẮNG HAY THUA?<br>Bruce Mehlman làm nghề tư vấn và vận động chính trị. Hôm nay, ông góp ý về sáu trận đánh có tính cách pháp lý của Chính quyền Trump, nhìn từ thực tế lịch sử của Hoa Kỳ. Có nhiều ý rất hay, với tính chất chuyên môn khá cao. <br>https://brucemehlman.substack.com/.../six-chart-sunday...<br>Six-Chart Sunday – Overruled: POTUS v SCOTUS<br>6 Infographics + 1 Video (Chef José Andrés on philosophy, philanthropy &amp; gastronomy)<br>(Bruce Mehlman - Jun 01, 2025)<br>What happens when Presidents lose in court? The Trump Administration has recently suffered a series of judicial defeats, on issues including trade, targeting of law firms, immigration, Harvard, and DOGE, with the pace of loss accelerating. All losses are being appealed. While White House rhetoric in response to adverse decisions has grown hotter, disputes between the Executive &amp; Judicial branches are hardly new &amp; rarely precipitate “constitutional crises.” Most Presidents stymied by judicial rulings find alternate approaches to advance their desired policies… changing the how more than the what. Here’s a look at present battles and historical precedents.<br>1/ The Trump Administration faces a historic number of lawsuits. While all modern Presidents have found their actions and initiatives challenged in courts, none have faced more lawsuits than Trump 2.0. More than 250 cases have been filed against Trump Administration actions so far in 2025, and “as of May 30, at least 182 of those rulings have at least temporarily paused some of the administration’s initiatives” (NYT).<br>2/ Presidents usually find different legislative authorities to advance their agenda when initially blocked by courts. After SCOTUS blocked President Biden’s effort to forgive ~$600B in student debt, for example, “the Biden administration shifted its focus to maximizing relief through existing mechanisms” and still found ways to forgive $183.6B. (As President Biden famously bragged, “The Supreme Court blocked it. But that didn’t stop me.&quot;) While the U.S. Court of International Trade this week rejected Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) for certain tariffs, the Administration has many other tools to impose tariffs and President Trump will surely persist with his ambitious trade agenda.<br>3/ Presidents often “work the refs” or try to change them. Throughout U.S. history, presidents have voiced discontent or defiance toward Supreme Court decisions, rulings or actions they did not like. Some presidents have openly criticized the Court&#39;s interpretation of the Constitution, while others have attempted to influence the Court&#39;s composition or power through various means, such as FDR’s court-packing plan. While many observers object to the current Administration’s unusually-aggressive public criticism (e.g. calls for impeachment of judges via social media), others point to prior events such as President Obama’s 2010 State of the Union (“ripping” the Court for its Citizens United decision) and President Biden (“admonishing” SCOTUS for its Dobbs abortion decision at the 2024 State of the Union).<br>4/  Presidents have ignored Supreme Court rulings. Court rulings do not always create affirmative obligations on presidents, as Courts are more likely to proscribe things presidents cannot do rather than dictate what they must do. Presidents have failed to act to enforce Supreme Court decisions (Jackson), directly defied rulings (Lincoln) and effectively undermined rulings (Nixon).<br>5/  Presidents can directly overrule court decisions in matters of crime &amp; punishment. The Constitution gives the president the “Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” Former President Joe Biden “granted more acts of clemency than any previous chief executive on record,” according to a Pew Research Center analysis, including pardons for family members both for prior convictions and for any crimes not yet discovered. In his second term President Trump is making robust use of clemency powers as well: “Beyond the nearly 1,600 ‘Day 1’ pardons and 14 commutations handed out to those charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Trump has so far pardoned or commuted more than 60 individuals.” (ABC News)<br>6/  Sometimes Presidents need to ask Congress for legislative authorities. Some Supreme Court decisions clearly block desired Presidential action, with no obvious alternative pathways. Examples include Truman’s attempt to nationalize steel mills during the Korean War, Clinton’s effort to dismiss Paula Jones’ sexual harassment case, George W. Bush’s ordering military tribunals for Guantanamo Bay detainees and President Obama’s would-be recess appointments when the Senate was not technically in recess. One area to watch in 2025 is the Trump Administration’s effort to cut federal spending via “impoundment,” which the Government Accountability Office this week found violated the Impoundment Control Act by blocking spending on electric vehicle charging stations. That case is one of 30 multi-state lawsuits already brought by states against the Trump Administration, a record pace for 130 days into a new term. <br>SO WHAT? Our legal system remains a critical check-and-balance against executive overreach, whether by Democratic Presidents or Republicans. But court decisions are often limited in scope and effectiveness. While litigation tracking is increasingly critical for businesses, universities, NGOs or investors aiming to understand and anticipate policy trends, observers should not expect definitive Court rulings that end debate, drama or deliberation.<br>VIDEO<br>Chef José Andrés is changing the world for the better.

Từ câu độc thoại trong tác phẩm chiếu từ 1989 tác giả dẫn ta đến thái độ ứng xử đúng đắn ngày nay. <br>Rất hay!<br>https://www.thefp.com/p/things-worth-remembering-when-to...<br>Things Worth Remembering: When to Stop Being Nice<br>“Decent people can be held hostage to their own gentleness and courtesy, intimidated into accepting ludicrous political speech codes,” writes Spencer Klavan. (Cinematic via Alamy Stock Photo)<br>To understand the power of kindness in an age of media mobs and toxic empathy, listen to Patrick Swayze’s monologue in ‘Road House.’<br>(By Spencer Klavan - The Free Press - 06.01.25 - Things Worth Remembering)<br>Listen to Article<br>9 mins<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Welcome to Things Worth Remembering, in which writers share a poem or a paragraph that all of us should commit to heart. This week, Spencer Klavan, host of the delightful Classics podcast Young Heretics, recalls the wisdom of his favorite “good bad” movie: Road House.<br>***<br>Some of the greatest writers in the English language, from George Orwell to G.K. Chesterton, were known to have a certain fondness for “good bad books” and “good bad poems.” These are texts so accessible and satisfying that a spoilsport would call them trashy, but everyone else loves them anyway. Stephen King, whose latest novel arrived this week, comes to mind, but Orwell’s example was the Victorian Rudyard Kipling, author of The Jungle Book - routinely named Britain’s favorite poet while sophisticates purse their lips.<br>There is also such a thing as a “good bad” movie. Everyone has a favorite, whether it’s A Walk to Remember or Rambo. Mine is the 1989 action classic Road House. It’s a great bad movie, a purehearted and neon-tinted distillate of the 1980s. Skip the self-serious Jake Gyllenhaal version from last year: The original, starring Patrick Swayze, is a picture that never needed to be remade. Swayze plays James Dalton, who comes to work as the “cooler” - or head of security - at a ramshackle roadside bar. He whips the bouncers there into an elite fighting corps. Then they fall afoul of a local crime lord. Kung fu ensues.<br>What makes the movie work is its laconic tough-guy screenplay, which is more effective than it has any right to be. “Pain don’t hurt,” Swayze tells Dr. Elizabeth Clay as she stitches him up after a bad brawl, and her heart flutters to see how this (shirtless, muscled) man values his honor over his comfort. It’s a ridiculous line, and also, it’s weirdly motivational. The whole two-hour joyride is like that. Its most iconic monologue - in which Dalton lays down three golden rules for his team of bouncers - contains a piece of actual, honest-to-goodness wisdom. The first two rules are decent enough: “Never underestimate your opponent” and “Never start anything inside the bar.” But it’s rule number three that belongs on a plaque:<br>“Be nice. Until it’s time. . . to not be nice.”<br>Today, online, nice guys are often thought of as weaklings. You won’t have to scan Reddit or X for long before you come across the adage that “Nice guys finish last,” often listed first among “10 Truths Every Man Needs to Understand.” This is a sentiment that was born in the ruthlessly competitive world of professional sports: In 1949, Dodgers manager Leo Durocher taunted the New York Giants, “The nice guys are all over there, in seventh place.” But online, men are applying this cutthroat logic to every arena of life, from the business world to the dating scene.<br>“We get burned... when we do the right thing,” said Brian Atlas of the massively popular Whatever podcast. “We see the women, and they go after the jerk, the asshole, the bad boy.”<br>Niceness might even be what brings civilizations to ruin. Another popular quote on the men’s forums is a passage from former Marine G. Michael Hopf’s postapocalyptic novel, Those Who Remain: “Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. And weak men create hard times.”<br>Women, too, are wondering if they should act more like bad boys. This is the kind of “girlboss” feminism expressed by pop songs like Taylor Swift’s “The Man.” But even conservatives who value feminine sweetness have started to worry that it can shade over into “toxic empathy,” the kind of ostentatious kindness that masks contempt. Last year, in her best-selling book Toxic Empathy, Christian influencer Allie Beth Stuckey wrote about how, among progressives, “empathy is weaponized to drown out any factual dissent.” She observes that decent people can be held hostage to their own gentleness and courtesy, intimidated into accepting ludicrous political speech codes. We want so badly not to seem callous or prejudiced that we become doormats instead. [Hay!]<br>So the question obviously arises: What should we be instead of nice?<br>Sometimes it feels like we can’t think of anything else to be besides performatively vicious. The age of social media, with its ruthless 24/7 competition for attention, has convinced many people that being nice gets you nowhere. Cruelty attracts more clicks.<br>The recent online debacle surrounding Shiloh Hendrix is a case in point. Hendrix, a mom from Rochester, Minnesota, seems to have called a black child the n-word after he rummaged around in her diaper bag. A third party, Sharmarke Beyle Omar, started filming her as she emphasized her lack of remorse. Then Beyle Omar posted the video online. A sordid routine ensued, in which Hendrix’s name, phone number, and address were broadcast online while clout-chasers bayed for someone to “go slap the hell” out of Hendrix’s own child and “make that baby brainless or something for a while.”<br>Then came a new escalation. The now-familiar spectacle of cancellation was met with commensurate enthusiasm for Hendrix, some of whose supporters celebrated her as “a white woman protecting her kids from black thievery.” Hendrix’s GiveSendGo crowdfunding page has now passed $750,000.<br>The implication, by both Hendrix’s detractors and defenders, was that in a world of cruelty, there’s nothing to do but be cruel back. It’s easy to understand the satisfaction that comes with condemning racism, or with standing up to cancel culture. It’s easy, too, to understand that any levelheaded response to the situation would just get lost in the social media scrum. But there is also something diabolical about the temptation to vent anger against anger, to magnify an already ugly confrontation with a glut of pent-up rage. The Greek poet Theognis wrote that “Nothing is more unjust than anger, which harms the one who possesses it.” The internet being what it is, there is always a good reason to lose your temper. But the minute you give in to rage you find that you have learned nothing, won nobody over, and succeeded only in making yourself and others more miserable. It’s a death spiral, a doom loop, a trap.<br>The escape route is found in the Book of Swayze: “Be nice. . . until it’s time to not be nice.” Dalton’s point is that getting goaded into losing control of your emotions is in itself another way of letting other people run roughshod over you and worsening the very problem you’re trying to fix. Even when a drunken stooge calls you a “cocksucker,” says Dalton, it’s just “two nouns combined to elicit a prescribed response.” When one of the guys asks what happens “if somebody calls my mama a whore?” Dalton hits him with a gaze of steel and asks, “Is she?” Dalton meets his bouncers’ swaggering bravado with the cool resolve of inner strength. His teaching is this: It’s better to keep your cool than vent your anger. The opposite of a pushover isn’t a berserker. It’s the man who has mastered himself.<br>“When you start to lose your cool,” wrote the Stoic philosopher and Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, “remember: There’s nothing manly about rage. It’s courtesy and kindness that define a human being - and a man. That’s who possesses strength and nerves and guts, not the angry whiners.” There is something higher and more important than niceness, but it isn’t cruelty or vindictiveness. It’s goodness. You can speak the truth bluntly without malice. You can defend the weak from the wicked without sadism. You can tell a troll to take a hike without publishing his address and wishing death on his children.<br>The undertow of reactive politics is fearsomely strong. It pulls always and everywhere toward the whirlpool of resentment and grievance. To keep your balance, you need firm rules that stay the same no matter how maddening your adversaries may be - rules that aren’t dictated by the emotions and controversies of the moment.<br>A good one is this: Be nice. Until it’s time. . . to not be nice.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R118" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">119</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">NÊN CẢI THIỆN ĐẠI HỌC HARVARD – BẰNG CÁCH KHÁC!<br>Ilya Shapiro đồng ý với Chính quyền Trump về nhiều tệ hại của Đại học Harvard, nhưng đề nghị phương pháp giải quyết khác.

They’ve discriminated on the basis of race in admissions and hiring, required loyalty oaths in the form of diversity statements, and allowed agitators to disrupt classes, block access to facilities, and wage mass campaigns of intimidation and harassment. The liberal left hand knew what the illiberal far-left hand was doing - the explosion in DEI that spawned everything from intellectual corruption and indoctrination to antisemitism and cancel culture - but was cowed into placating it.<br>Harvard, besides being the biggest global brand in American higher education, is at the epicenter of this crisis. For example, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) named it the worst school in the country for free speech for the last two years, the only one with a negative score. There are other schools that may be worse on other measures, but Harvard is a fitting lightning rod for popular displeasure with our gowned oligarchy.<br>Still, the Trump administration’s blunderbuss tactics threaten its reformist goal, with which I’m entirely sympathetic. Left-wing intolerance and perfidy have undermined universities’ core mission of open inquiry and truth-seeking, but executive-branch overreach and impatience with legal niceties have allowed Harvard grandees to don the mantle of academic freedom and educrats to dig in their heels.<br>The executive branch is fully justified in launching investigations of Harvard and dozens of other schools for violating civil rights by: allowing antisemitism to flourish, using racial preferences in defiance of the Supreme Court, subverting student rights to free speech and due process, making hiring decisions based on illegal criteria, and a host of other pernicious practices. Violations of that kind do indeed imperil all federal funds, including grants to scientific and medical researchers who may want nothing to do with woke administrators, because there’s no germaneness or even proportionality requirement in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and other relevant laws.<br>It can even go after plagiarism - recall Harvard’s short-lived president, Claudine Gay, who remains on the faculty with a $900,000 salary - because that’s taxpayer-subsidized fraud.<br>But imposing financial consequences, let alone revoking tax-exempt status, requires waiting for those investigations to be completed so that an evidence-backed indictment can be laid at Harvard’s feet. Issuing a list of demands - in a letter that was apparently sent by mistake - won’t cut it.<br>john harvard statue<br>What would John Harvard think of all of this? (Maddie Meyer)<br>It’s not surprising that Harvard responded with a lawsuit, one it’s likely to win based on process fouls, without even reaching the substance of the administration’s charges against the school. Alas, that would damage the administration’s leverage over universities.<br>The White House’s latest move further illustrates the weakness in the administration’s approach. Last week, it announced that Harvard would be cut off from the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP), meaning that the school would be unable to sponsor student visas. The move set off understandable panic, because 27 percent of Harvard students are foreigners. That’s not unusual in the Ivy League; the foreign share of Yale students stands at 28 percent, while the figure is over 50 percent at Columbia. Why so high? Follow the money: international students are more likely to pay the exorbitant sticker price of tuition, plus many foreign governments fund American universities. Unsurprisingly, Harvard immediately got a temporary restraining order, and on Thursday the same judge issued a preliminary injunction.<br>That’s because the ostensible basis for revoking Harvard’s SEVP certification - non-compliance with information requests - doesn’t pass the legal smell test. Visa-sponsoring schools do have to report certain things about their foreign students, like whether they’re making progress towards their degree or whether they’ve been disciplined for misconduct. But the information that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanded goes beyond what the law requires. For example, she wants Harvard to report everything it knows about international students’ “dangerous” actions and turn over any “audio or video footage... of any protest activity.”<br>The relevant regulation, however, requires schools to report “any disciplinary action the school takes against a student as a direct result of a criminal conviction,” explicitly excluding “student life infractions.” The government can certainly ask for more than is required by that provision, but Harvard is within its rights to hold DHS to the letter of the law on visa eligibility.<br>Moreover, Harvard has a strong argument that the government is singling it out for its high-profile opposition. Why didn’t Secretary Noem ask for the same information from every Ivy League university or every university over a certain threshold of foreign students?<br>Why didn’t the Justice Department do this as part of the numerous civil-rights investigations described above? It’s too coincidental that Harvard is the only university suing the administration. After all, Columbia is worse at “perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students” and “promot[ing] pro-Hamas sympathies” (quoting Noem’s letter), but Columbia settled with the administration.<br>Politically, it makes sense to go after Harvard, the self-anointed center of the academic universe, but judges don’t go in for PR stunts.<br>The administration is on much surer footing in pausing student-visa interviews while considering new guidance on social-media vetting, or in revoking the visas of Chinese students “with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.”<br>These are measured steps that are tied to specific statutory authorities. But the government can’t steal legal bases, even in pursuit of a righteous cause against bad-faith actors.<br>From its own perspective, the administration may prevail either way. Even if Harvard wins in court, the administration wins in the court of public opinion. But is the point to “own the libs” and make Harvard even more unpopular or to effect lasting change?<br>As my colleague Chris Rufo has written, instead of “making graphic displays of force, the administration should change incentives, rewrite laws, [and] depersonalize its enforcement actions.”<br>This essay was originally published on FoxNews.com with the headline, “Yes, Take Down Harvard but Team Trump Must Do It the Right Way.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R119" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">120</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">HÁT HAY MÀ XẠO DỞ!<br>Hôm nay, giáo sư Jonathan Turley có một bài rất thú vị về sự gian trá.

U2 Frontman Claims 300,000 Have Died Due to USAID Cuts<br>“Courtesy of the Seattle Municipal Archives”<br>(Jonathan Turley - Uncategorized - June 1, 2025 <br>In Running to Stand Still, Bono sang that you should “cry without weeping. Talk without speaking.” He can add “condemn without counting.” Recently, the U2 frontman declared that 300,000 have died as a result of USAID funding cuts.  The source for this widely cited figure is an example of how some facts are simply too good to check in the media.<br>Bono said “This will f— you off” and explained that tens of thousands of tons of food are “rotting” in warehouses from Djibouti to Houston because of recent USAID cuts, adding “What is that? That’s not America, is it?”<br>“They’re throwing the baby out with the bathwater,” he said, acknowledging that while some aid groups do good work, the USAID system has been riddled with corruption.<br>It turns out that the 300,000 figure comes from a speculative model put out by Brooke Nichols, a mathematical health modeler at Boston University.<br>I was critical of how these cuts were handled initially. It does appear that some important programs were interrupted and, while later restarted, the interruptions created dire and potentially deadly conditions for some of the most desperate recipients of U.S. aid.<br>However, it is the figure of 300,000 that shows how such calculations go viral in this political environment.<br>Nichols insists that this was never an actual count but a projection. It is the parameters of the projections in The Washington Post that are so striking. Nichols admitted that<br>    “The biggest uncertainties in all of these estimates are: 1) the extent to which countries and organizations have pivoted to mitigate this disaster (likely highly variable). And 2) which programs are actually still funded with funding actually flowing - and which aren’t.”<br>In other words, it depends on whether the programs were actually discontinued and whether local officials stepped forward to continue them. Those seem like some pretty significant “ifs” and raise the question of why project over a quarter of a million deaths on such assumptions. It seems akin to projected hundreds of thousand of deaths from air accidents if every FAA system under Trump is suddenly turned off.<br>What is the value of a projections with such sweeping “likely highly variable” assumptions?<br>I still like Bono’s music. It is his math that leaves me with the feeling that “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R120" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">121</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">NỘI THÁNG SÁU TỐI CAO PHÁP VIỆN PHẢI CỨU XÉT CHÍN HỒ SƠ…<br>The Epoch Times cho biết trước khi nghỉ hè, Tối Cao Pháp Viện phải phán quyết chín hồ sơ nội trong Tháng Sáu. <br>Đây là các hồ sơ:<br>https://www.theepochtimes.com/.../top-9-supreme-court...<br>The Epoch Times<br>Top 9 Supreme Court Decisions to Watch for in June<br>The justices heard cases on gender, Obamacare, pornography regulation, and other issues ahead of the summer recess.<br>The U.S. Supreme Court in Washington on May 19, 2025. As the court heads into its summer recess, justices are expected to issue a series of high-profile rulings throughout June. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times<br>(By Matthew Vadum, Sam Dorman - The Epoch Times - May 30, 2025 - Updated: May 31, 2025)<br>The Supreme Court is heading into its summer recess, which means the justices will be issuing a series of hotly-anticipated decisions throughout June. These decisions could yield significant precedents that ripple through the national political environment, impacting congressional and executive agendas alike.<br>So far, the court has already released rulings on e-cigarettes, a deportation case, ghost guns, and TikTok. Here are the decisions to look out for as the term comes to a close.<br>1. ‘Gender-Affirming Care’ for Minors<br>In December 2024, the justices were called upon to enter the gender debate by hearing arguments over Tennessee’s attempt to prevent “gender-affirming care” from being provided to minors. The case focused on the use of cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers, rather than surgical procedures, but raised constitutional questions common to both sets of procedures.<br>Weeks before leaving office, the Biden administration argued in United States v. Skrmetti that Tennessee’s law constituted a form of sex-based discrimination that violated the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment.<br>Tennessee argued its law was needed to protect underage patients from what it considers to be risky, unproven medical interventions, and that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit correctly ruled the law was constitutional.<br>The Supreme Court seemed inclined to uphold the Sixth Circuit ruling. Some justices seemed hesitant about viewing Tennessee’s law as an unconstitutional form of discrimination, while other justices seemed inclined to take that position. Justice Clarence Thomas asked why the court shouldn’t see the law as an age-based classification rather than a sex-based classification.<br>2. Nationwide Injunctions, Birthright Citizenship<br>Lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump’s agenda have led to federal judges issuing injunctions on a range of policies. In turn, the administration has accused these judges of overstepping their authority, sparking a debate about the separation of powers.<br>The Supreme Court justices looked at three lower court orders that issued nationwide blocks on Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship. Lawyers representing the administration argue the 14th Amendment does not require that children of illegal immigrants be automatically deemed citizens from birth.<br>On May 15, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Trump v. CASA Inc., and while it is unclear how the justices might rule, they seemed more inclined to address the lawfulness of the various court orders, as opposed to the legality of Trump’s policy.<br>Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan seemed to think the administration had misinterpreted the 14th Amendment. “As far as I see it, this order violates four Supreme Court precedents,” <br>Sotomayor said.<br>Justice Clarence Thomas seemed the most sympathetic to the Trump administration’s position, and suggested that nationwide injunctions do not have a solid historical basis. “So we survived until the 1960s without universal injunctions?” Thomas said.<br>image-5865608<br>U.S. Associate Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas attends an inauguration ceremony for President Donald Trump in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20, 2025.

Sex and Gender in School Libraries<br>Parents sued the Montgomery County School Board in Maryland after it determined that parents could not opt their children out of book readings with controversial content about gender and sexuality. The policy mandated new “LGBTQ-inclusive” storybooks for elementary school students that promote gender transitions, Pride parades, and same-sex romance between young children.<br>The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, involved parents arguing that the school district violated the First Amendment by compelling their children’s participation in instruction on gender and sexuality. Doing so interfered with their free exercise of religion by curbing parents’ authority over classroom instruction, they said. Hundreds of parents showed up at board meetings while board members accused parents of promoting “hate.”<br>The justices seemed more sympathetic to the parents. Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the fact that the school board was democratically elected didn’t mean it could violate rights. “We’re here to protect the liberty and the Constitution from democratic excess,” he said.<br>Justice Samuel Alito defended the parents, saying they weren’t trying to alter the board’s curriculum - they merely wanted the right to opt out.<br>4. Obamacare Preventive Care Panel<br>In Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc., the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of the federal Preventive Services Task Force, which was created under the Obamacare law, and makes binding recommendations about preventive medical services.<br>Members of the task force are appointed by the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said doing so violates the Constitution’s Appointments Clause, which provides the president may appoint officers to assist him in carrying out his responsibilities. Such officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.<br>During the oral argument, the justices seemed skeptical of arguments from Braidwood Management, a Texas-based company that objected on religious grounds to providing HIV prevention medicine and sexually transmitted disease screenings. The task force had required that employers cover such medicine and services for employees.<br>Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the company’s argument assumed the task force was “massively important” even though Congress hadn’t clarified that was the case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor seemed to downplay the importance of task force members, likening them to the law clerks who help the justices “on some of the things we don’t know anything about.”<br>5. Age Verification for Pornography Websites<br>As politicians at the federal level attempt to regulate the digital adult entertainment industry through policies such as mandatory online age verification, Texas passed a law requiring just that.<br>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the law, stating that it didn’t violate the First Amendment. An adult entertainment industry group, Free Speech Coalition,  asked the Supreme Court to intervene.<br>In Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the coalition argued in January’s hearing that the appeals court should have applied a stricter standard, a legal test known as heightened scrutiny, when assessing whether the law accorded with the First Amendment.<br>The petitioners contended that the age verification procedures, which include presenting government-issued identification, discourage users from accessing the products out of concern that their personal information will be exposed by hackers. Texas argued that its law is constitutional.<br>The state cited Ginsberg v. New York (1968), which allowed the regulation of the sale of pornography offered in brick-and-mortar bookstores or sidewalk magazine stands on the theory that the material might be harmful to children. In this instance, a standard lower than heightened scrutiny was sufficient to assess the constitutionality of the regulation, the court held in Ginsberg.<br>The justices seemed divided during oral arguments. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said applying the highest level of scrutiny used in cases related to adult entertainment would likely lead to the Texas law being struck down.<br>Meanwhile, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said voluntary screening measures by the porn industry weren’t effective. And neither was content filtering, which the industry suggested was a better alternative to Texas’s law, as “the explosion of addiction to online porn has shown,” Barrett said.<br>6. Medicaid Funding for Planned Parenthood<br>Abortion returned to the Supreme Court this term with Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, a case about Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions as well as birth control and pregnancy testing. In April, the justices heard arguments over South Carolina’s attempt to exclude the abortion provider from its state Medicaid program.<br>At issue is whether the federal Medicaid Act created a right for low-income Americans to choose their providers. The original lawsuit was brought by a Medicaid client who wanted to use Planned Parenthood’s services. If the Supreme Court finds for South Carolina, the ruling could encourage states to eject the organization from their Medicaid networks, Planned Parenthood says.<br>The case goes back to 2018, when South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster signed a pro-life executive order directing state health officials to “deem abortion clinics unqualified to provide family planning services.” It also required officials to terminate such clinics’ enrollment agreements and deny their enrollment applications in the future.<br>image-5865609<br>South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (C) speaks at a press conference outside the U.S. Supreme Court as justices hear oral arguments in Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic in Washington on April 2, 2025. The case centers on South Carolina’s effort to exclude Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program over abortion coverage. Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images<br>Justice Elena Kagan said the state “has an obligation to ensure that a person … has a right to choose their doctor.” Justice Brett Kavanaugh indicated some kind of clarification on the matter was necessary because of “confusion” in lower courts.<br>7. Mexico’s Lawsuit Against Gun Companies<br>U.S. gun manufacturers have asked the Supreme Court to quash a lawsuit brought by the Mexican government, which alleged that U.S. companies were liable for guns being used in violence committed by criminal cartels in Mexico.<br>Although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit allowed the lawsuit to proceed, the Supreme Court seemed skeptical during oral arguments in March that Mexico had shown the companies were liable under the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which generally protects firearms companies from lawsuits based on criminals misusing their products.<br>The First Circuit ruled the law requires companies to face lawsuits if they knowingly violated state or federal law and if that violation was a proximate cause of a given harm.<br>Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested Mexico had not shown the gun companies were liable. Mexico’s attorney said the lawsuit claimed distributors were “knowingly supplying the dealers who we know sell unlawfully across the border.”<br>Sotomayor replied, “We have repeatedly said mere knowledge is not enough. You have to aid and abet in some way. ... You have to intend and take affirmative action to ... participate in what they’re doing.”<br>Justice Clarence Thomas also seemed concerned that the lawsuit didn’t show a violation of particular laws, while Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson seemed to worry that Mexico’s arguments would invite unwarranted judicial intervention.<br>8. Palestinian Terrorists<br>In two consolidated cases - Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and United States v. PLO—the Supreme Court justices considered whether the families of terror attack victims could sue the Palestine Liberation Organization terrorist group. In April, the Supreme Court seemed to lean toward upholding the federal Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, which empowers Americans harmed by terrorist attacks abroad to sue in U.S. courts.<br>image-5865607<br>Palestinian protesters push a dumpster for cover during clashes with Israeli forces after a rally supporting Gaza in Hebron, in the West Bank, on Oct. 13, 2023.

Hazem Bader/AFP via Getty Images<br>Mariam Fuld sued under that law after her husband was killed near a West Bank shopping mall in 2018. The attack was perpetrated by a Palestinian terrorist allegedly incited by the Palestine Liberation Organization, which uses a so-called martyrs’ fund for families of Palestinians killed, imprisoned, or injured when attacking Israel.<br>When the case reached the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Fuld lost because the judges said the law violated due process protections.<br>During oral argument, Justice Clarence Thomas questioned the PLO attorney’s contention that the terror group and the Palestinian Authority are “persons” given status by the Fifth and 14th Amendments, which would grant it due process rights. Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the courts shouldn’t interfere with the lawsuit.<br>9. Nuclear Waste Storage<br>Texas objected to the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s attempt to license private storage providers to operate an interim storage facility in the Permian Basin, which is the nation’s most productive oil field. The state said the proposed location could jeopardize the oil field.<br>Texas sued, and the Supreme Court took up the Nuclear Regulatory Commission v. Texas case after the state won in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Judges there said the federal Atomic Energy Act does not authorize the commission to give a private business a license for an interim storage facility. The federal government told the Supreme Court the Fifth Circuit’s decision imposed “novel limits” on the commission’s licensing powers, and “upends” a “44-year-old regulatory framework for licensing storage of spent fuel.”<br>During oral arguments in March, Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned the decision to locate the facility “on a concrete platform in the Permian Basin, where we get our oil and gas from.” Also critical was Justice Samuel Alito, who said granting long-lasting licenses for interim storage facilities undermines the wishes of Congress.<br>image-5865606<br>An oil pumpjack operates in the Permian Basin oil field in Odessa, Texas, on March 13, 2022. Texas is challenging the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s effort to license private companies to run an interim nuclear waste storage site in the Permian Basin, the country’s top oil-producing region.

Standing in the way of his efforts to rid America of a violent and deadly scourge are the radical left, Democrats, federal courts, and university presidents who are determined to protect pro-Palestinian terrorists from his deportation campaign.<br>Everyone wants Trump to lose. This includes certain self-proclaimed MAGA influencers, who are obsessed with the idea of Israel as a uniquely evil force in world history and American Jews as a malignant fifth column. The influencers are joined by Trump officials trying to reorient the president’s Middle East policy and negate the successes of his first term. Both camps now find themselves on the same side as the globalist institutions they say they despise: the United Nations and other world bodies that threaten national sovereignty, America’s as well as Israel’s.<br>Since Oct. 7, the United Nations has used its monopoly on aid distribution to bring Israel’s military campaign to a halt and save Hamas. The international body has also been the leading voice in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as the “blood libels against Israel,” baselessly accusing the IDF of genocide and creating a climate that led to the murder of the two embassy employees. On May 20, the day before the attack, the United Nations’ under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs Tom Fletcher said, “There are 14,000 babies that will die in the next 48 hours unless we can reach them.”<br>But there is no famine - only an ongoing series of reports, many produced by the same organization, warning of famine since almost immediately after Oct. 7, without ever having produced one starvation victim. It’s a blood libel meant to incite antisemitic violence, and it’s also a pro-Hamas propaganda campaign. Call it the famine hoax. It began even before Israel entered Gaza, and was designed to reshape the rules of war in ways that would ensure Hamas’ survival.<br>Trump was elected to hold the line and make America great again, not to implement the failed policies of his predecessors while allowing lunatics to mainstream conspiracy theories and incite hatred.<br>On Oct. 16, 2023, nine days after 1,200 were killed and hundreds taken hostage, the World Health Organization warned of a “catastrophe” in Gaza, claiming that there were only 24 hours of water, electricity, and fuel left. “You cannot use aid, or food and water, as an instrument of war for any political or military ends,” said Marwan Jilani, director general of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. “There is an urgent need to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” said Egypt’s foreign minister. But back then, Israel hadn’t invaded Gaza yet. Egypt controlled the Rafah crossing - and was fully capable of getting food into Gaza. But it didn’t. Needless to say, no international tribunals threatened Cairo with war crimes charges, nor did Palestinian activists accuse the Egyptians of genocide.<br>In late December 2023, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification issued a famine warning and claimed that at least a quarter of people in Gaza were experiencing famine-level forms of deprivation. In mid-March 2024, the Biden White House’s USAID administrator Samantha Power said that Gaza was at a “serious risk of famine,” meaning that the famine predicted four months previously had not materialized. She called to “dramatically surge” humanitarian aid “as conditions continue to deteriorate.” Again, there was no famine.<br>That didn’t stop top Biden administration officials from using words like famine and starvation, any more than Israel’s record-low urban warfare casualty rates have prevented celebrity activists like Mark Ruffalo from repeatedly claiming that Israel was committing “genocide.” It seems Biden’s vice president didn’t understand the difference between a famine and a report forecasting a possible famine. “People in Gaza are starving,” said Kamala Harris. “The conditions are inhumane, and our common humanity compels us to act,” she continued.<br>In reality, of course, the people who were being starved in Gaza for the past two years were Israeli hostages who were fed a quarter of a pita per day while their captors gorged themselves on stolen food aid. After the Palestinians put their captives on parade, Trump expressed revulsion. “It looked like many years ago, the Holocaust survivors,” said the president, “and I don’t know how much longer we can take that when I watch that.”<br>Famine, starvation, and genocide are simply keywords in an information campaign whose goal is to generate enough outrage among the public and policymakers to ensure Hamas’ survival through Western aid packages, and thereby to ensure that Israel loses its war in Gaza. For instance, a few weeks ago, Iran regime lobbyist Trita Parsi posted a picture of what he claimed was a young Gazan girl who had died of starvation. In fact, it was a photo of a child who was being treated at a UAE hospital for a rare disease that left her emaciated. The veracity of the picture was irrelevant. The point was to advance the famine op.<br>[Nên chú ý đến hai đoạn dưới này, vì chung quanh Trump có nhiều kẻ kỳ thị Do Thái và chống Israel!]<br>It was with Trita Parsi, vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think tank started by George Soros and Charles Koch, that the Gaza famine hoax jumped the rails from the left to the right. Quincy’s Republican and Democrat donors share the view that Israel is the destabilizing force in the Middle East and thus that an Iranian bomb will bring balance to the world’s most volatile region. Despite the president’s warnings to keep Koch associates out of the administration - the Koch network opposed Trump’s candidacy for the Republican nomination in 2016, 2020, and 2024 - Trump officials continue to tap them for senior-level positions. An article from Quincy’s in-house publication reinforced Parsi’s claims of famine, quoting Cindy McCain, the director of the World Food Program, and widow of the late Arizona senator and dedicated Trump foe John McCain. She said in May 2024 that there was a “full-blown famine” in northern Gaza and that it was “moving its way south.”<br>[Nhớ tên xưng danh ‘sử gia’ Daryl Cooper, thực chất là phát xít, lại được thằng Tucker Carlson quảng cáo!] <br>Parsi’s tweet was relayed by Darryl Cooper, a social media influencer and revisionist historian of National Socialism credentialed by top-shelf MAGA podcasters Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. “Gaza Holodomor,” Cooper posted over Parsi’s tweet, referring to Stalin’s forced starvation of millions of Ukrainians. <br>Podcaster Theo Von then posted a video on X, claiming there is a “genocide” in Gaza and that the United States is “complicit.” His post went viral, as millions absorbed the accusation from an entertainer who recently opened for Trump when he spoke to U.S. troops based in Qatar. Quincy’s X account tweeted approvingly of Von’s charges, as did influencer Candace Owens. “Well done, Theo,” she posted over Von’s tweet. “God will have his vengeance on those that defend what is happening in Gaza.”<br>Maybe nominally pro-Trump influencers didn’t know they were advancing a fake narrative initiated by the same U.N. agency that covered up the origins of COVID-19 and facilitated lockdowns and mask and vaccine mandates here at home. Maybe they didn’t know that the famine op was managed by the former head of USAID, an agency since closed down by Elon Musk that, under Samantha Power’s tenure, sent billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund globalist causes. Or maybe it didn’t matter they’d taken sides with the same cohort that had threatened to starve, impoverish, and imprison Americans if they didn’t take the COVID-19 vaccine. Targeting Jews was in fact more important to them than any part of Trump’s agenda.<br>And the top item on Trump’s Middle East agenda is Iran’s nuclear weapons program. Trump has made the stakes clear: Iran can’t have a bomb. It can give up its nuclear program peacefully, or, he says, there will “be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”<br>Admittedly, it’s often hard to hear what Trump is saying because there are multiple players running information operations to drown out the message. There’s Iran and its domestic allies, like Parsi; there are anti-Bibi Israeli officials and activists determined to bring down the government no matter the cost; there are Arab allies, like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that fear they have the most to lose if they’re caught in the middle of a U.S.-Iran confrontation; and there’s Qatar, a sometime U.S. ally whose media celebrated the murder of the two Israeli embassy employees.<br>But most significant among these foes are those who are ostensibly in Trump’s own camp.<br>“It’s clear that now is the worst possible time for the United States to participate in a military strike on Iran,” Carlson tweeted in April. “We can’t afford it. Thousands of Americans would die. We’d lose the war that follows. Nothing would be more destructive to our country. And yet we’re closer than ever, thanks to unrelenting pressure from neocons.”<br>In the paranoid version of world events concocted by Carlson and his guests, it is the “neocons” who drive the United States to war in the Middle East, motivated in turn by Netanyahu’s insatiably expansionist ambitions. And now, says Carlson, the neocons are at it again with Trump. It is true that America has repeatedly become embroiled in Middle Eastern wars over the past four decades, among many others: the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983; the First Gulf War against Iraq in 1990 following Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait; the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and its subsequent attempts to remake that sectarian tinderbox as an American-style democracy; the Libya operation in 2011; and the U.S. support of Syrian Kurdish forces aligned with Iran that began in 2014. Yet none of these operations ever had anything remotely to do with defending Israel or forwarding Israeli aims in the region, which have been focused for the past three decades on fighting Palestinian terror as well as opposing Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Iranian nuclear threat.<br>The idea that Netanyahu and Israel are the cause of America’s Middle Eastern wars is a paranoid fantasy. Accordingly, Carlson’s template for Trump’s foreign policy seems cribbed from the most destructive conspiracy theory in U.S. history: Russiagate. The left said Trump was controlled by the Russians; Carlson says no, it’s the Jews.<br>The second-term anti-Trump operation is a domestic variation on Russiagate, and it operates in much the same way - with anonymous administration officials leaking stories to the same media organizations and many of the same reporters who spread that Russiagate hoax. For example, a recent CNN story carries Natasha Bertrand’s byline. She was a leading Russiagate media operative who broke news of the letter signed by 51 former U.S. spies claiming that Hunter Biden’s laptop was Russian disinformation. CNN juiced Russiagate when, in January 2017, it reported the existence of the dossier alleging Trump’s ties to Russia. Stories leaked to Bertrand and CNN are by their nature weaponized to damage Trump policy.<br>Everyone wants Trump to lose. This includes certain self-proclaimed MAGA influencers, who are obsessed with the idea of Israel as a uniquely evil force in world history and American Jews as a malignant fifth column.<br>Copied link<br>Bertrand’s May story, sourced to U.S. officials, reported that “the U.S. has obtained new intelligence suggesting that Israel is making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities.” The point of leaking intelligence on Israel is, first, to make Jerusalem anxious by implying a wide and growing divide between Trump and Israel and to throw sand into the gears of the U.S.-Israel relationship and create distrust. More nefariously, they’re attempting to box in the president himself; if he then does what he says he’ll do, that will be evidence that the conspiracy theorists are correct and that the White House is in fact controlled by “neocons,” making Trump look like a stooge. If Trump changes course, they’ll applaud him for being far-seeing and independent-minded - i.e., adopting the worldview of the bipartisan U.S. foreign policy establishment, from Bush 43 to Barack Obama, that prioritizes the peace process and a “grand bargain” with Iran.<br>Early in May, The Washington Post, the central Russiagate clearinghouse, reported that Michael Waltz was moved out of his job as national security advisor because he “upset Trump after an Oval Office visit in early February by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during which the national security adviser appeared to share the Israeli leader’s conviction that the time was ripe to strike Iran.” Further, Waltz “appeared to have engaged in intense coordination with Netanyahu about military options against Iran ahead of an Oval Office meeting between the Israeli leader and Trump.”<br>So what if he did? The job of the national security advisor is to coordinate the president’s policies within the U.S. government and with foreign allies. Insofar as Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if it doesn’t abandon its nuclear program, Waltz would have simply been doing his job. The purpose of the story is revealed in the use, twice, of the word appeared - which means that the sources didn’t see or hear anything directly. The story was fed to the Post to dirty Waltz as a “dual loyalist” and to reframe the president’s relationship with Netanyahu as negative and inherently oppositional.<br>Meanwhile, the reality of the U.S.-Israel relationship has become increasingly difficult to ascertain beneath all the noise - fulfilling at least one aim of the op, which is to obscure and negate what Trump announces as policy. In an April 22 post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “I’ve just spoken to Prime Minister of Israel, Bibi @Netanyahu, relative to numerous subjects including Trade, Iran, etc. The call went very well - We are on the same side of every issue.” But not if you read MAGA social media accounts or the anti-Trump media administration officials use to undermine Trump policy.<br>Last week, one unnamed U.S. official told Axios that Vice President J.D. Vance decided against traveling to Israel for fear of suggesting that the White House endorsed Israel’s campaign in Gaza, again implying a large and widening divide. But according to a recent statement from Netanyahu’s office, “President Trump expressed support for the objectives set by Prime Minister Netanyahu: to secure the release of all our hostages, to eliminate Hamas, and to advance the Trump Plan” - which is, transferring all Palestinians out of Gaza.<br>So who is telling the truth about what Trump believes about the Middle East - longtime enemies like the Koch network, Cindy McCain, and CNN, or President Donald Trump himself? The question seems absurd. Yet Trump’s insistence on giving power to people in his administration who coordinate messaging with his enemies in the media and political establishment makes it hard to know.<br>Maybe Tucker Carlson is right to warn that war with Iran would be the equivalent of World War III. Sure, the Israelis have destroyed Iran’s air defenses and degraded its deterrence capabilities in their campaigns against Hamas and Hezbollah, but maybe it won’t be easy to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities. Sure, Trump was elected to fix the U.S. military and return its focus to war-fighting from climate change activism and the trans agenda. But if he’s controlled by neocons, as Carlson says, then he can’t fix those problems, because the bigger problem is the Jews.<br>And yet Donald Trump said that the problem was the swamp. He said that the ruling establishment had betrayed Americans by shipping off our manufacturing base to China and impoverishing the middle class. He said Americans are poorer today because the corporate bosses paid the political elites to flood the country with cheap foreign labor. He said we can’t win wars anymore because our military leadership is lousy. He said Europe keeps taking advantage of us and no president has been willing to call them to account - we pay billions to defend them, and in exchange, they keep us out of their markets. We pay to protect Europe, so their kids get good cheap college education from some of the best universities in the world, while our kids have to take on debt by age 19 to go to college, and even then all the places are taken by rich foreigners who spy on our research labs, burn American flags, and chant death to the Jews.<br>You can put it on a podcast, but it’s the same energy that motivated town criers throughout the Middle Ages: Our harvest is spoiled, our wells are empty, and who is to blame? But American lives were upended not by metaphysical evil or even natural catastrophe. Specific people and institutions made deliberate choices that degraded our public life, from Russiagate and the plot against Trump to COVID-19 and the erosion of political norms and the rule of law, all culminating with the installation of a half-demented president sustained by a corrupt political class determined to break the will of the American public in order to maintain its own privileges and profits. Trump was elected to hold the line and give Americans a chance to get back on their feet and make America great again, not to implement the failed policies of his predecessors while allowing lunatics to mainstream conspiracy theories and incite hatred.<br>This is MAGA’s second chance, owing to a miracle in a field in Pennsylvania. Forfeiting our blessing to test fate seems unwise.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R122" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">123</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">HÔN NHÂN ĐỒNG TÍNH GIỮA NAM GIỚI<br>Sharyl Attkisson cho chúng ta biết kết quả khảo sát dư luận Hoa Kỳ về hồ sơ này 10 năm sau khi Tối Cao Pháp Viện có phán quyết đồng ý.

Hodges ruling legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, Gallup finds that overall public support remains steady - but the partisan divide has reached record levels.<br>According to the poll, 68% of Americans support legal recognition of same-sex marriage, a figure that has remained relatively unchanged since 2021. However, this apparent stability conceals a significant partisan shift. Republican support has dropped 14 points since 2022, now sitting at 41% - the lowest since 2016. Meanwhile, Democrat support has reached a new high at 88%, and 76% of independents remain supportive.<br>The resulting 47-point gap between Republicans and Democrats marks the widest partisan divide Gallup has recorded on the issue since it began tracking in 1996.<br>Gallup also reports that 64% of Americans consider same-sex relations to be morally acceptable - a figure consistent with the past three years but down from a peak of 71% in 2022. Again, partisan differences are sharp: 86% of Democrats say same-sex relations are morally acceptable, compared to just 38% of Republicans.<br>Demographic breakdowns show broader support among women, younger adults, and college graduates, while those who attend religious services weekly show the lowest levels of support for both same-sex marriage and relations.<br>Despite broad national support, Gallup notes growing concern over the future of same-sex marriage rights. Justice Clarence Thomas, in a 2022 opinion, urged reconsideration of past rulings like Obergefell, and some Republican-led states have introduced measures to challenge the decision. These moves suggest the issue may re-emerge in legal and political battles ahead.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R123" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">124</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">BỘ QUỐC PHÒNG HOA KỲ BÁO ĐỘNG:<br>TRUNG CỘNG CÓ THỂ TẤN CÔNG ĐÀI LOAN!<br>Hôm nay, Sam Cooper loan tin trên The Bureau:<br> https://www.thebureau.news/.../beijing-imminent-threat-to...<br>Beijing &#39;Imminent&#39; Threat to Taiwan: U.S. Defense Secretary Issues Stark Warning<br>(By Sam Cooper - The Bureau - May 31, 2025)<br>SINGAPORE - In an unprecedented escalation of U.S. military preparedness rhetoric, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth today warned that the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan - and broader actions against Asian states - is “real and could be imminent.” Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth made clear that the United States now views China’s intentions as an urgent and rising threat, not a distant risk.<br>“We are preparing for war in order to deter war to achieve peace through strength,” Hegseth said. “Any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force will result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world. There’s no reason to sugarcoat it. The threat China poses is real and could be imminent.”<br>A clip of Hegseth’s address quickly circulated on social media. In response, Taiwan’s security chief Joseph Wu wrote: “It’s critical for all U.S. allies and partners to remain clear-eyed about China’s ambitions. Taiwan is investing seriously in its own defense. But recent PLA activity suggests Taiwan is not the only target. We must work together to prevent the CCP from dominating the Indo-Pacific.”<br>Recent military intelligence shows that Beijing is actively preparing for large-scale operations. In April 2025, China launched “Strait Thunder 2025A,” a major military exercise involving 135 warplanes and 38 warships encircling Taiwan. The drills simulated both a blockade and an amphibious landing. Around the same time, the Shandong aircraft carrier group maneuvered to within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan’s coast. Intelligence analysts warn that such incursions are likely to increase, with growing concern that operations staged as exercises could serve as cover for the sudden launch of a full-scale invasion.<br>“U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific can and should upgrade their own defenses,” Hegseth added. “It has to be clear to all that Beijing is credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.”<br>He drew a direct connection to President Donald Trump’s campaign to push NATO countries toward increased defense spending.<br>The Indo-Pacific Will Be ‘Your Generation’s Fight’<br>Two days before Hegseth’s speech in Singapore, a parallel message echoed across the U.S. military establishment. On May 29, speaking at the U.S. Air Force Academy’s commencement, Secretary of the Air Force Troy E. Meink delivered a blunt forecast: the cadets’ careers would not be shaped by past wars in the Middle East, but by looming great-power conflict in the Pacific.<br>“Class of 2025,” Meink said, “the Indo-Pacific will be your generation’s fight. And you will deliver the most lethal force this nation has ever fielded - or we will not succeed.”<br>Framing China as the central challenge of the era, Meink echoed Hegseth’s call for deterrence through strength. He stressed that defending the U.S. homeland must go hand-in-hand with building a Joint Force capable of neutralizing China’s expanding military capabilities - including its missile arsenal, cyber units, and maritime coercion in the East and South China Seas.<br>Meink also pointed to the modernization of U.S. deterrence infrastructure, including development of the so-called “Golden Dome” - a proposed network of land- and space-based sensors and interceptors designed to detect and defeat hypersonic and ballistic missile threats aimed at North America and U.S. bases abroad.<br>China’s Amphibious Blueprint: From Dockyard to Beachhead<br>Meanwhile, analysis of striking new satellite imagery reveals a dramatic development in China’s military posture. A series of large vessels under construction at Chinese shipyards appear designed to sail toward Taiwan’s shores, lower pilings into the seabed, and transform into floating sections of a mobile landing dock - assembled in real time upon arrival.<br>The design, which eliminates the need for ports or tugboats, reinforces mounting concerns that Beijing’s preparations are not symbolic, but operational.<br>Naval analyst Tom Shugart, building on open-source intelligence findings, released high-resolution imagery showing the vessels’ defining features. Each ship appears purpose-built for amphibious warfare - engineered to deliver tanks and armored vehicles directly onto contested beaches with speed and efficiency.<br>“These aren’t simple barges,” Shugart wrote. “They look like self-powered landing ships.”<br>Each vessel includes six vertical pilings that can be lowered to anchor the ship to the ocean floor, stabilizing it during offload. Two wide ramps can be unfolded to connect with roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, allowing vehicles to drive directly from transport to shore.<br>This floating dock system would allow China to launch a mechanized amphibious assault with minimal delay - an essential capability for a rapid strike across the Taiwan Strait.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R124" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">125</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">GIÁO DỤC ĐẠI HỌC HOA KỲ VỐN ĐÃ MỤC NÁT<br>BÊN TRONG CÒN ĐÁM MÔ PHẠM CUỒNG TÍN!...<br>Hôm nay, giáo sư Jonathan Turley giúp chúng ta thấy một trường hợp tiêu biểu tại Đại học Tiểu bang ở San Diego, khi tên giáo sư phổ biến tin mừng: một cựu chiến binh Israel bị cá mập ăn thịt, cho đáng đời.

Chicano studies Professor Roberto Hernández joyfully reported the death and mocked the victim as others joined him in the macabre celebration.<br>The site College Fix reported that Professor Hernández shared an article on his personal Facebook page with the title “Former Israeli Soldier From the 8207 Battalion is Eaten by a Shark in Occupied Palestine.” Alongside the late-April post, he wrote, “Shark Oyate for the win!! #solidarity #FreePalestine.” Oyate is a term derived from the Dakota language, meaning “people” or “nation.”<br>Hernández then continued to mock the victim with others on the site. When someone asked if the shark was okay, Hernández responded by saying he “heard [the] shark contracted cancer.”When another said that they hoped the victim “was aware of what was happening” and that “it was tortuous [sic],” Hernández reacted by liking the comment.<br>On his page, Hernández describes himself on Facebook as “an unapologetic anti-Zionist, AND a proud pro-Semite in that … [he supports] the Semitic Palestinian people and Semitic original Jewish peoples of Palestine.” He has held high-ranking positions at SDSU, including chairing the University Senate’s 2024-25 DEI committee as well as the search committee for the College of Arts and Letters provost search. He was also a member of the SDSU Press editorial board.<br>Comments on his original post were divided, with some people agreeing with him, and others calling it “despicable behavior,” especially for a professor.<br>Violent commentary by liberal faculty is not uncommon in higher education.<br>We have previously discussed professors advocating “detonating white people,” denouncing police, calling for Republicans to suffer,  strangling police officers, celebrating the death of conservatives, calling for the killing of Trump supporters, supporting the murder of conservative protesters, supporting for the attempted assassination of President Trump, and other outrageous statements. One professor who declared that there is “nothing wrong” with such acts of violence as killing conservatives was actually promoted.<br>Postings on social media outside of school are generally protected from liability. However, that has not stopped schools from targeting conservatives who say inappropriate or controversial things on social media. Conservative North Carolina professor Dr. Mike Adams faced calls for termination for years with investigations and cancel campaigns. He repeatedly had to go to court to defend his right to continue to teach. He was then again targeted after an inflammatory tweet. He was done. Under pressure from the university, he agreed to resign with a settlement. Four years ago this month, Adams went home just days before his final day as a professor. He then committed suicide.<br>Political commentary on social media is generally protected speech. However, this latest controversy shows how, while purging most faculties of conservatives and libertarians, universities are hiring far-left and radical academics to teach in higher education. They, like Hernández, are given major positions in the institution and then replicate their extreme and intolerant views. Keep in mind that these individuals rarely come to universities as clandestine radicals. Faculty members hire them in full knowledge (and with full support) of their extreme views.<br>The discussion between Hernández and many of these commentators shows how rage gives a license to many to abandon the most fundamental notions of civility and humanity. These same individuals view themselves as great humanitarians as they strip any humanity from those they hate. They celebrate the painful deaths of those with opposing views with a righteous rage that is addictive and contagious.<br>Professor Hernández, like so many of his colleagues, is teaching a chilling lesson by example to his students in how to hate without hesitation or reflection. For its part, SDSU will express fleeting concern and then continue the same hiring practices that have turned higher education into a far-left academic echo chamber.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R125" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">126</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">CỤC DIỆN UKRAINE THAY ĐỔI LỚN NHỜ ‘DRONES’<br>Tường thuật đáng chú ý trên tờ NY Sun:<br>Trực thăng đưa Putin đi thăm khu vực Kursk tiếp cận với Ukraine lại nằm trong tầm nhắm của máy bay drones do lính Ukraine sử dụng.

Andriy Andriyenko/Ukraine’s 65th Mechanized Brigade via AP<br>Few Ukrainians or Russians display high hopes for a second round of peace talks scheduled for Monday at Istanbul. Instead, Russia is launching its fourth summer offensive, presumably hoping to strengthen its position in serious peace talks this fall. So far this year, Russia has advanced at the rate of only five square miles a day, according to Washington’s Institute for the Study of War. In two weeks, Russia’s toll of dead and wounded is expected to hit 1 million, according to a daily tally maintained by Ukraine’s military since Mr. Putin in February 2022 launched his full-bore attack.<br>Today, both countries race to produce thousands of drones guided by fiber optic wires. Immune to jamming by electronic warfare equipment, these drones are controlled through fiber threads no thicker than a strand of human hair. Spooling out as far as 10 miles, a thread, these drones give controllers clear battlefield views and deadly accuracy.<br>This spring, fiber optic drones helped Russia carry the day in its successful offensive to recapture the Kursk region. Ukrainian soldiers found their radio wave jamming equipment was useless. Soldiers could only move around on cloudy or windy days.<br>As their logistical supply road increasingly was cut by drones, Ukrainian drone operators noticed telltale tangles of glinting threads on the ground. Soldiers joked that they could only defend themselves with scissors. Today engineers are working on a solution: A killer drone that can track a fiber optic thread to its source.<br>A Ukrainian soldier of the 71st Jaeger Brigade prepares a FPV drone at the frontline, near Avdiivka, Donetsk region, Ukraine, Friday, March 22, 2024.<br>A Ukrainian soldier of the 71st Jaeger Brigade prepares a FPV drone at the frontline, near Avdiivka, Donetsk region, Ukraine, March 22, 2024. AP/Efrem Lukatsky<br>These fiber optic drones are “expected to play a crucial role in Russia’s unfolding summer offensive,” a Henry Jackson Society research fellow, David Kirichenko, wrote Thursday for the Atlantic Council.  “If Putin’s commanders can implement the fiber optic drone tactics that proved so successful in the Kursk region, they may be able to finally overcome Ukraine’s dogged defenses and achieve a long-awaited breakthrough.”<br>While Ukraine still lobbies President Trump for conventional military aid, the Pentagon and the rest of the West are largely bystanders in this shape-shifting drone war. Ukraine still needs artillery and tank shells, but drones now inflict about 70 percent of Russia’s casualties. This year, Ukraine aims to build 4.5 million drones, almost 50 times America’s capacity. Now, America, Britain, and France are racing to build their own factories, in some cases partnering with Ukrainian manufacturers. <br>If NATO ever tangles militarily with Russia, it will face a fast-evolving foe that pulls even with Ukraine in drone warfare. Last week Russia’s largest schoolbook publisher announced that it has partnered with Russian drone maker Geoscan to produce a textbook for technology classes this fall “Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: 8th and 9th Grades.”  Part of a wider militarization of Russian society, the textbook is part of a plan to train 1 million Russian drone operators at more than 500 schools and 30 universities by 2030, Geoscan reports. <br>For its part, Ukraine’s army now runs contests, awarding more resources, including fiber optic drones, to drone teams that score the highest number of kills. In April, Ukrainian drone brigades reported hitting 83,000 Russian targets - largely soldiers, vehicles, radar stations, and artillery cannons. To defend against Russia’s summer offensive, Ukraine is crafting “drone walls” - 10-mile wide “kill zones” - along the 600-mile long front line. <br>BAKHMUT, UKRAINE - JULY 16: A Ukrainian drone operator named Shrike from the 3rd Assault brigade lands his drone after a surveillance flight on July 16, 2023 near Bakhmut in the Donetsk Region of Ukraine.

Paula Bronstein/Getty Images<br>On the battlefield, unmanned all-terrain vehicles now ferry food and ammunition to forward positions. In one case this month, one of these ‘robots with wheels’ extricated a wounded soldier, carrying him 10 miles to safety. Ukrainian journalist Nataliya Gumenyuk writes this week in the Atlantic: “Drones now guide artillery, deliver payloads, resupply units, and even map out minefields. They’re fast, cheap, adaptable - and built right at home.”<br>At sea, Ukraine, a nation without a navy, used maritime drones to break Russia’s naval blockade of Ukraine’s Odessa region grain ports. After losing about a quarter of its ships, Russia’s Black Sea fleet largely retreated from its historic home in Crimea to take refuge in Russian seaports guarded with steel nets.<br>In a surprise for Russia this spring, Ukraine placed anti-aircraft missiles on several Magura V7 maritime drones. In a world first, a Ukrainian naval drone patrolling the Black Sea shot down two Russian Su-30 fighter jets. Each was valued at $50 million.<br>Now both sides study British and Israeli laser anti-aircraft cannons that down drones for $5 a shot.  President Zelensky told reporters at Kyiv on Tuesday:  “We are also moving towards drone-to-drone interceptors.” He estimates that Russia produces about 300 long-range drones a day, triple Ukraine’s production. He added:  “I would like to see us receive $30 billion to launch Ukrainian production at full capacity.”<br>His former military chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said last week in a speech at Kyiv that Ukraine must use drones to wage a “high-tech war of survival”  in order to “make the economic burden of the war unbearable for Russia.” He warned: “Where yesterday we were ahead of the enemy. The enemy has already outpaced us.” Only five percent of Ukraine’s 500 drone manufacturers are producing fiber optic drones.<br>Shifting focus from last winter’s attacks on oil refineries, Ukrainian drone operators hit over the last month 10 different Russian arms factories, several of them deep inside Russia. Although drones do not pack the explosive punch of rockets, they can set off fires or damage high-value fixed targets, such as parked war jets.<br>One target that Russian air defense guards zealously is a joint Russia-Iranian drone production factory at Yelabuga, Tatarstan, about 600 miles northeast of Ukraine. There, a $2 billion deal with Iran - partially paid in gold bars - is paying off with a second-generation, jet-propelled Russian version of Iran’s Shahed-136 drone.<br>“Russian drones now fly faster and at higher altitudes, beyond the reach of Ukraine’s mobile air defence groups,” reads a report released Thursday by the Washington-based global security research group.

Carrying 200-pound payloads, these new drones have been recorded at 16,000 feet.<br>Communist China also helps Russia through production of military versions of civilian Mavic quadcopters assembled by DJI, the world’s largest drone maker. “Chinese Mavic is open for Russians, but is closed for Ukrainians,” Mr. Zelensky said Tuesday. “There are production lines on Russian territory where there are Chinese representatives.”<br>As for Mr. Putin flying 10 days ago in skies infested with Ukrainian drones, it is unclear if the Ukrainian military drone operators knew that Russia’s president was in the area. In what could be a clue, Mr. Zelensky and his wife, Olena, made a special purchase yesterday at Kyiv’s largest book fair, Arsenal Book Festival. Later, he wrote on his Telegram page: “Today, we purchased several publications for our library, including ‘To Kill a Tyrant. A History of Tyranny from Caesar to Gaddafi.’”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R126" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">127</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">HỒ LY TINH TRONG CHUỒNG GÀ!<br>Báo The Epoch Times tổng kết vi phạm của các ‘sinh viên’ Trung Hoa lại hoạt động về tình báo cho Cộng đảng ngay trên đất Mỹ....<br>Mãi rồi ta mới hiểu vì sao Bộ Ngoại Giao Hoa Kỳ có chánh sách hạn chế các sinh viên đến từ Trung Cộng.

Getting both right would be much easier if more investors behaved rationally. Alas, they don’t, which is why stock prices do incomprehensible things.

If you find this material useful, I highly suggest you order your own set now.<br>“THE PESSIMISM IS DECREASING” <br>Swiss money manager Felix Zulauf (and former Barron’s Roundtable favorite) is always one of our most popular presenters at SIC. He has a way of cutting through the narratives to express what’s really important. <br>This time Felix began by describing a key change many people haven’t yet processed. <br>          “I think what most investors are missing is that politics in the next few years will play an increasing role in determining the swings in the stock markets and in the financial markets in general. These trend breaks are of major magnitude and they are changing the world from where we come from over the last 50, 70 years or so…<br>          “In the past, when the trends were [going] smoothly for many decades on the way up, geopolitical events didn&#39;t matter much. They mattered for a day or two, and then the market went back to the previous trends. I think this is different at this time and it introduces a new quality of volatility into the economy, into our financial system, and into financial markets. And depending on what the major leaders do in the world politically, the markets will swing up and down.<br>          “This is completely different from what used to be the case. In the past, most strategists forecast corporate earnings, and they smoothed it over the next 12 months and then they forecasted the interest rates and then they applied the multiple and that&#39;s how they came up with a target for the stock market. They may still do so, but I think it&#39;s a useless exercise. I think you need to know which way the political mood swings and what that means for the sentiment because in the market, the sentiment reflects expectations, and we trade expectations and not facts.”<br>I think Felix is right; expectations are increasingly diffuse, with different people expecting different things based on their own informational silos. The idea of a “consensus” view is increasingly irrelevant. <br>As for Felix’s own expectations, he is presently quite bullish but doesn’t expect to stay that way. His outlook has some twists and turns, so read this carefully.<br>          “I think we passed the point of maximum pessimism in early April. We are on the way up. And the question is now why does it go up? Obviously, the pessimism is decreasing, and so prices are recovering. And the economists and strategists are increasing their forecasts for economic growth and corporate earnings again, et cetera. That&#39;s the normal process. They always lag behind the market, they never lead. They always lag and follow the market; they do not lead the market.<br>         “I think what&#39;s important now is what will happen in the monetary arena and that is the next big question... The bond market is sort of in a limbo and bond yields are moving higher a little bit and I think approaching 5% or so, is a problem for the Fed. I think the Fed would actually begin intervening around 5%. So, I do not see 10-year Treasuries above 5% in the next six months. I think that the Fed would intervene and either buy Treasuries directly, which is a new form of QE, again, or by steepening the yield curve to make it attractive for the banking system to buy Treasuries and earn money on that leveraged position.<br>          “So that is how I see the monetary condition improving. And in combination with the technical position that I see will probably catapult the market indices, the major indices above the former highs. And that by itself will then soak in more money, so we could have a run to whatever, could be 7,000 or so. [It is around 5,900 as I write.]  <br>          “But once that run is over, I think the market will be at a similar risk to early this year because the underlying economy will slow down. What happened to tariffs and even if they’re now backpedaling… has introduced a lot of mistrust and uncertainty on the side of corporations.<br>          “So, a lot of investment projects are going to be postponed, et cetera, and consumers may fear for their jobs and save more and spend less. And the corporate sector will probably not expand as much as it would have done otherwise. And with pharmaceutical prices attacked by the president, that means that the pharmaceutical industry, that announced major investments in the next few years in the US, will probably hold back.<br>          “I think the economy eventually will disappoint later this year into &#39;26 and that will bring the market down. So, from a new high, I think we will probably then be ready for another big decline and probably below the lows seen in April.<br>          “So, if somebody puts a gun to my head, I would say on the S&amp;P 7,000, then 4,500 and then 9,000 again thereafter. It&#39;s a big rollercoaster, a rollercoaster I talked about since 2020, when I said this is the beginning of the end game and it&#39;s going to be a lot of fun for those who know how to play it.”<br>Felix added something else interesting:<br>          “So actually, retail has become the smart money, and professionals have become the dumb money, so to speak. And I think this is so because the professionals understand the risks involved, whereas the retail investors, they watch the television moderators and they do what they say and they do not point to risks, they always talk about rewards.”<br>This connects with something else I will get to below. But let’s first look at another bullish view.<br>2/ BOOMER CONSUMERS<br>Dr. Ed Yardeni is best known for his time as Deutsche Bank’s chief economist. Now he has his own advisory firm and puts out some of the best research I receive. Ed is not just bullish on stocks; he is kind of a super-bull, and he’s been right while many of us were wrong. He began writing about what he calls The Roaring ’20s very early on and has remained consistent. Even when his analysis says caution might be prudent, his long-term view is still very bullish.<br>The primary reason for this bullishness is really quite simple: Consumer spending is strong and Ed thinks it will remain so.<br>          “When we talk about the consumer, there&#39;s a tendency to view the consumer as one entity who all behave the same, and we all know from our personal lives that that&#39;s not the case. There are all kinds of consumers. There are different age consumers and there&#39;s consumers with different profiles in terms of their incomes, in terms of their wealth… <br>          “The household sector has never ever been richer. The household sector collectively has $160 trillion in net worth. This includes houses, includes stocks, mutual funds, annuities, and its net worth…. We know that half of that is held by the Baby Boomers, so we&#39;ve never had a richer household sector.<br>          “They&#39;re sitting on a lot of net worth and they&#39;re going to be careful about how they spend it because they don&#39;t know how long they&#39;re going to live. But on the other hand, they are going to spend it.<br>          “I think we are going to see a negative savings rate for the overall economy as retiring Baby Boomers spend more and more of their retirement nest eggs. That&#39;s what it&#39;s for.”<br>Many Boomers are already handing down assets to younger generations.<br>          “They&#39;re not waiting to pass away to pass the money on, and I think a lot of that explains why the consumer has been so resilient in the face of a tightening of monetary policy. I think it also explains why the labor market has been so strong.<br>          “When you look at the areas of strength in the labor market, you see that we have record employment in hospitality and leisure, restaurants, motels, hotels, airlines, all have record high employment and continue to gain employment. Well, that&#39;s the Baby Boomers who are retiring or retired. They&#39;re going on cruises. They&#39;re traveling, they&#39;re having a good time.<br>         “What else do we know in terms of employment? Well, we know that healthcare employment is at an all-time record high. Again, clearly the Baby Boomers.”<br>Ed Yardeni sees AI and technology as bullish, too. Among other benefits, they will solve the labor shortage.<br>          “I think we&#39;re in a digital revolution. A few centuries ago, we had the agricultural revolution and then the industrial revolution…. I think that AI is in fact going to continue that digital revolution and it will give us more and more power to increase productivity with this technology.<br>          “So, I look at all that put together, and I did look at it in 2019 and I said, well, where is this all going to lead? Thinking 10 years out in 2019, before the 2020s started, I started arguing that it could be the roaring 2020s, that as we look at the decade ahead, we know we&#39;ve got a shortage of labor on a worldwide basis. We know that we&#39;ve got a significant shortage of skilled workers on a worldwide basis, and we know that there&#39;s technological innovations that can help solve the problem of a shortage of skilled workers.”<br>He talked later about tariffs, acknowledging they are a problem like any other tax increase. But he thinks the stock market is looking past that, and more toward higher earnings in 2026. Even a debt crisis doesn’t faze him. Similar to my Great Reset idea, Ed thinks a crisis that forces politicians to take real action would be disruptive but also unleash a better future.<br>Ed Yardeni said a lot more I can’t include here, but you really should read the transcript.<br>3/ GAMBLING MENTALITY <br>I want to end with Liz Ann Sonders, chief strategist at Charles Schwab. Her firm has a unique perspective on individual investor attitudes and preferences. Part of that unique perspective is that they have $10 trillion (trillion as with a T) of primarily retail investor money, much of which is self-managed. Not only does this afford them an insight into retail investor trends but they also do a lot of research on their clients in a continual effort to improve their service. That powerful information informs Liz Ann’s viewpoints. “Casual” dinners with her are fascinating.<br>My partner Ed D’Agostino asked Liz a great question that elicited an even greater answer. Read this carefully.<br>          (Ed D&#39;Agostino): “How much influence would you say the individual investor, or the retail investor, has on the markets today? When I was coming up, it was you can&#39;t compete with the algos, they&#39;re going to dominate the market. But it seems like that may have changed.<br>          (Liz Ann Sonders): “I think it has. Not only by virtue of metrics like the percentage of household assets that are invested in the equity market, and that&#39;s now about 43%, which is an all-time high exceeding where we were back at the prior peak, which is in that 1999, 2000 period of time. So there&#39;s that metric that suggests there&#39;s more literal and figurative ownership of equities in this backdrop. You also have a huge surge in interest in and investments in more passive-type vehicles and index funds…<br>          “And then just the unique characteristics of COVID and the work from home, everything becoming much more digital in nature. I think there was also the rise simultaneously of sports betting, so it helped to foster a little bit of that gambling mentality, which has been really fascinating in these last few months.”<br>Her point about a gambling mentality in the markets brought back a memory of saying something like that myself. I dug around and found it in my April 2021 Tsunami Warning letter. I was talking about the old days of “odd lot” trading. Then I wrote this:<br>          “We have, without really noticing, severed the connection between share price and liquidity. This matters in ways I think we may not fully understand. Combine it with game-like mobile apps that let people buy and sell in individually tiny amounts that add up to the big numbers once reserved for giant institutions. And without any kind of institutional decision-making process to constrain rash moves…<br>          “We have raised a generation playing adrenaline-charged video games. For a relatively small stimulus check, they get to play in a game where Dave Portnoy assures them that stocks only go up, or they can ‘stick it to the man’ in GameStop. Sigh…<br>          “In the bigger picture, all those small accounts add up to enormous sums of hair-trigger money. Some of it has much higher risk tolerance. The app users don’t see it as a nest egg to preserve. In their minds, it’s more like buying gas to get to work - something you have to burn. The whole concept of a stock being overvalued or undervalued doesn’t apply. They just want it to move. Where all this will lead is uncertain but I suspect it won’t be good.”<br>Four years later, I think we’re starting to see the results of this change. Among other things, price-insensitive buying helped stocks reach valuation levels far above what was once thought reasonable.<br>It’s another reason why I think past experience is becoming a much less useful barometer of what we can expect in the future. What was once irrational is now common, and vice versa.<br>This was echoed by Liz Ann in her interview. Quoting briefly:<br>          “Let me mention a couple of things. I think arguably based on what was pretty resilient economic data in advance of ‘Liberation Day,’ I think the massive sell-off that ensued, it started at the recent peak on February 19th, and then ultimately you had the intraday low on the delay, the 90-day delay to reciprocal tariffs. I think that’s near bear market, in the case of the S&amp;P 500 and pretty comfortably into bear market territory with indexes like the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000, that probably overshot a discount of the near-term economic hit.<br>          “And we did in turn see pretty resilient economic data. But I think maybe we&#39;ve overshot in the other direction, but that&#39;s the nature of this market right now. There is so much short-term money in the market. And not just by their traditional institutional players of algo-based funds and quant-driven funds and high-frequency trading firms… but the fact that retail investors have become so much more active and have very, very short time horizons for the most part. I think that means naturally you&#39;re going to get these pendulum swings that go beyond the underlying fundamentals.<br>          “All that said, the other thing I wanted to say is I&#39;m almost 40 years doing this, and I&#39;ve often said that when it comes to the relationship between data, economic data, earnings data, macro information, and how the stock market behaves, ‘better or worse’ can often mean more and matter more than ‘good or bad.’ It&#39;s human nature for us to think, ‘Is this good? Is it bad? Is it strong? Is it weak?’ But it&#39;s that direction, it&#39;s better or worse that tends to matter. And boy, we are living in an extreme…”<br>In writing this letter, I went back and reread Liz Ann’s transcript. I wish we could just post her entire presentation because it’s very valuable. There’s a reason we keep inviting her back to the conference. We get wisdom each year and somehow, she never repeats herself. It’s all seemingly fresh from a seemingly never-ending source.<br>Finally, I want to mention that David Bahnsen’s SIC presentation was one of the finest investment lessons I have ever witnessed. Basically, he made the case that as investors we should ignore the latest headlines du jour as they very rarely impact the long-term economy. It is interesting to talk about, but we have to be careful of letting the emotional impact, either good or bad, get in the way of a rational long-term investment strategy. It deserves a letter in itself - which I will do soon - but even then, you won’t get the full story. Get the transcript and you can read it yourself.<br>4/ DALLAS, WEST PALM BEACH, AND DC<br>I will now be in Dallas the early part of the week of June 9 as we will be opening our new longevity clinic there. I will then go to West Palm Beach and the DC area (actually Columbia, Maryland) to do the same and of course we will be opening the clinic here in Dorado, Puerto Rico. Depending on the construction gods, they will all be open sometime mid- to late June. When we are past the beta opening status, I will give you full details, websites, and a considerable amount of research.<br>I am in full research and writing mode on my book about what I believe is the coming crisis and how we can all get happily through it. I am starting to incorporate AI into the research. My own journey into AI is three parts fascinating and one part frustrating - the lack of a rational helpdesk at AI firms like Anthropic’s Claude for simple things like “Will you take my money?” And only getting back circular references which keep telling me to click on the link to get an email which tells me to click on a link to get the same email. I am told AI is going to make a big difference in my life so I will persevere. But you would think something supposedly intelligent could answer a simple question about taking my money. Maybe they should train it on marketing materials. And yes, I know that it is probably my fault, but just saying…<br>Finally, I really want to give a shout out to Ed D’Agostino, my partner and now the host of his own weekly podcast. He has been doing a lot of the moderation for our conference for years, but he really stepped up the quality of his game in the last few years as a host that can get the most out of his guests. A lot of it has to do with the intense prep work that he does, but part of it is just a natural curiosity that brings out the best from his guests. I look forward to his weekly podcasts and you should too.<br>And with that, I will hit the send button and wish you a great week. <br>Your trying to do too much analyst,<br>John Mauldin<br>Co-Founder, Mauldin Economics</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R129" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">130</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">BI KỊCH THÊ THẢM CỦA ĐẢNG DÂN CHỦ<br>Sau khi uốn éo hươu vượn về trò hoang tưởng cực tả và mất cử tri vì đa số các quận hạt đều thiên về phía Cộng Hòa, các chiến lược gia của đảng tìm hiểu nguyên do thất bại tại một nơi đắt tiền nhất nước, rồi hạ quyết tâm: từ nay sẽ tập ăn nói như dân Mỹ, cho người dân biết đảng muốn gì!<br>Hội đồng Biên tập Issues &amp; Insights bèn nhẹ nhàng nêu ra sự thật. <br>Đảng Dân Chủ chưa biết thực chất vấn đề là họ cứ vẽ ra một thiên đường hiện hữu trong tâm trí của thiểu số có tiền và có học, rồi múa may trên đó mà không rõ là ở dưới đất, người dân ăn sống ra sao và muốn gì!<br>Nếu chưa từng sống trên đất Mỹ và đọc loại phân tách thế này thì lắm người tưởng là mình lạc vô sở thú, thấy lũ khỉ tập đi hai chân và đánh vần như người, để mong loài người sẽ được tiến ngang giống khỉ! <br>Hèn chi con vượn cái là Dân biểu AOC đang mơ lãnh đạo nước Mỹ. <br>https://issuesinsights.com/.../rogets-thesaurus-wont.../<br>Politics <br>Democrats’ Brilliant New Strategy: Learn To Speak Like An American<br>(By I &amp; I Editorial Board - May 30, 2025)<br>This week, we saw a spate of news stories blaming Democrats’ troubles on their vocabulary. They’re just using too many darn multisyllabic, academic-sounding words and turning off numbskull voters, is the basic message.<br>Seriously?<br>The Democrats’ problem isn’t linguistic, it’s ideological. But no one in the party wants to admit that.<br>A Washington Post story this week – “Democratic troubles revive debate over left-wing buzzwords” – begins by saying:<br>    &quot;Maybe it’s using the word ‘oligarchs’ instead of rich people. Or referring to ‘people experiencing food insecurity’ rather than Americans going hungry. Or ‘equity’ in place of ‘equality,’ or ‘justice-involved populations’ instead of prisoners.&quot;<br>    &quot;As Democrats wrestle with who to be in the era of President Donald Trump, a growing group of party members - especially centrists - is reviving the argument that Democrats need to rethink the words they use to talk with the voters whose trust they need to regain.&quot;<br>The Post goes on to say that “liberal candidates too often use language from elite, highly educated circles,” and quotes Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear saying that: “It makes Democrats or candidates using this speech sounding like they’re not normal.”<br>Earlier this year, a group of centrist Democrats gathered at a ritzy resort in Loudoun County, Virginia, the richest county in the country, to talk among themselves about how to regain working-class trust.<br>Among the recommendations: “get out of elite circles and into real communities” and embrace “traditional American imagery.”<br>This week, we also learned that Democrats are spending $20 million to “study the syntax, language, and content that gains attention and virality” of “American men.” The project is called – and we are not making this up – “Speaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan.”<br>So, if we understand all this correctly, the answer to the Democrats’ problems is to wave more flags, pretend to like beer, drop more f-bombs, and stick to one-syllable words?<br>The problem is that voters can smell the phoniness a mile away. Just ask Tim Walz<br>The country has overwhelmingly shifted to the right because Democratic policies no longer appeal to anyone other than insulated, elitist, over-educated snobs who can’t stand the majority of their fellow countrymen.<br>In a truly eye-opening report, the New York Times found a massive disparity in the number of counties that have shifted rightward in the past three presidential elections (1,433) versus those that shifted to the left (a mere 57).<br>What’s more, almost all the counties where Republicans made gains are working class, while Democratic gains were isolated in wealthier, better-educated counties.<br>Is that because Democrats use words such as “intersectionality” or “cisgendered.”<br>Hardly. It’s the Democrats’ far-left agenda that is turning off voters. Their policies, not their word choices, are what resulted in a flood of illegal immigrants, economic stagnation, sky-high inflation, worsening violent crime rates, growing racial strife, climate and “gender” fanaticism. They can’t talk to regular Americans anymore because nothing they stand for these days appeals to regular Americans.<br>And it’s not because of how Trump talks, but what he talks about, what he proposes, and what he’s achieving that is drawing people to the Republican Party. You know, common-sense things such as secure borders, lower taxes, fewer federal mandates, less wasteful spending, safer streets, better schools, an unapologetically America First foreign policy.<br>Democrats can break out their thesauruses all they want, but their fortunes will never change so long as their agenda is dictated by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R130" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">131</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">BÀI RẤT LẠ, NÊN ĐỌC, CỦA MIKE RYAN TRÊN HALF FULL REPORT:<br>Hãy đọc chầm chậm, hiểu dần các ẩn dụ rồi thấy ra một viễn ảnh khác…<br>https://www.tothepointnews.com/.../half-full-report-053025/<br>HALF-FULL REPORT 05/30/25<br>Published May 30, 2025 | By Mike Ryan<br>The Collapse of Russia’s Sacellum<br>Last week, on the Forum, TTP member spisskyhrad asked an interesting question, “Is TDS some kind of color revolution driven by forces I can barely understand? Vandalism, assassinations. Unhinged violence like we are experiencing simply defy logic. Older white women with no children or husbands stealing Trump hats off strangers. MK Ultra type crazy!! Why???”<br>Across cultures, Dr. Jack Wheeler taught us that the evil eye symbolizes a malevolent force: envy turned spiritual violence. In Russia, the evil eye is collective, externalized. In the West, it’s internalized as a corrosion of agency. Together, they form a dyad of dysfunction that explains a lot of the madness we’re seeing, from cultural collapse to ritualistic hatred of figures like Trump.<br>But first we have TDS, or Trump Derangement Syndrome. Let’s not mince words. It’s real. It’s not just political disagreement. It’s visceral, cultic, and utterly irrational. We are not witnessing a debate. We are watching a form of secular exorcism, and it is failing.<br>Russia: Evil as the External Other<br>In Russian Orthodoxy, evil is not found within. It is the outsider. The foreign agent. The saboteur. The West, the liberal, the individualist, the heretic are all outsiders infecting the moral core of a Russkiy Mir (Russian World) that believes itself eternal, holy, and embattled.<br>That’s why Russian propaganda doesn’t waste time convincing you it’s right. It convinces you that everyone else is evil. The goal isn’t to win an argument. Russian propaganda’s purpose is to annihilate your moral frame of reference. Russia projects evil onto the Other, which justifies internal repression and external violence. It’s collectivist defense by demonization.<br>The West: Evil as the Loss of Personal Agency<br>Contrast that with the West, where evil isn’t always out there. It is the gnawing sense that I no longer control my life. This loss of personal agency breeds anxiety, then rage. COVID lockdowns. Job automation. AI displacing workers. “Experts” moving the goalposts. The collapse of shared truth. People feel hollowed out, not just by politics, but by meaninglessness.<br>That is what makes TDS so potent. Trump, whether you love him or hate him, represents agency. He says the quiet part out loud. He breaks the script. He refuses to be programmed. And that drives the technocratic class, the emotionally fragile elites, and the spiritually starved overeducated, yet deservedly under loved liberal women insane.<br>When she steals a Trump hat off a stranger in public and shriek like a banshee while filming it on her iPhone, she is not protesting, she is performing a primitive exorcism. She is trying to rid the world of the last totem of free will, masculinity, and resistance to centralized control. It’s voodoo. It’s mass psychosis. It’s Orwell with better lighting.<br>COVID: The Initiation Ritual of a New Technocratic Priesthood<br>COVID was not an accident. By now, we all know this It was an initiation ritual. Think of it this way: every religion has a purification event. COVID was the blood baptism of the global managerial elite.<br>Gates, Fauci, Schwab; these weren’t public servants. They were high priests. Their robes were lab coats and lanyards. Their temples were TED Talks and Davos panels. Their sacred text was “The Science,” which conveniently changed week to week.<br>The goal wasn’t safety. It was compliance. Social distancing, masks, lockdowns. These were rituals of submission. And like all cults, they demanded sacrifice: small businesses, mental health, childhood development, freedom.<br>And now, the blowback is rolling in like a toxic tide. Excess deaths, fertility collapses, psychological breakage, and the realization that we were all lab rats in a planetary experiment no one signed up for.<br>TDS: A Color Revolution of the Mind?<br>fall-of-cliffIs TDS a color revolution? Damn right it is. But it’s not about flipping governments. It’s about flipping reality. It uses the same tools: information warfare, emotional contagion, symbolic violence, engineered chaos. But instead of toppling a regime, it topples the soul.<br>MK Ultra didn’t die in the 70s. It went viral. And today’s version doesn’t need LSD and electroshock. It has Twitter. It has Facebook. It has academia, late-night television, and TikTok witches hexing Supreme Court justices.<br>TDS turns ordinary people into ideological berserkers. They’re not thinking. They’re manifesting psychic trauma onto public figures. Trump is just the canvas. The real sickness is the hollowed-out cultural self that can no longer tolerate contradiction, masculinity, confidence, or independent thought.<br>Why Are Some Older White Women Crazy?<br>Because in many ways, they’re the final avatars of the broken matriarchy. No children. No family. No anchor to biological or cultural continuity. Raised in the wake of the feminist revolution, fed a steady diet of CNN, pharmaceutical coping, and NPR morality, they lash out like priestesses of a dying cult and are offended by the mere existence of the unapologetic.<br>They want to smash the totems. Steal the hat. Shame the unbroken. It’s not politics. It’s primal.<br>Evil today wears a lab coat or a hashtag. It speaks in consensus and cries “disinformation.” It hates the masculine, the rooted, the free. Whether in Moscow’s paranoia or San Francisco’s TikTok psychosis, it flows from the same source: the destruction of individual agency and moral clarity.<br>This is the age of mirrored demons. We’re all staring at each other through smoke and lies, each side certain the other is possessed. But only one side is trying to erase the concept of truth itself.<br>Stay rooted. Know your history. Find your tribe. This fight isn’t over.<br>********<br>Russia’s Tragedy: A Modern Greek Drama of Hubris, War, and Geopolitics<br>The great power game of 2025 isn’t about who wins in Ukraine anymore. That war is a symptom. The real contest and the one that will shape the 21st century is about who gets to mold the carcass of Russia into something useful.<br>Russia is no longer a player. It has become the board. A shattered empire picked apart by vultures circling its bones.<br>Three predators stalk this kill: the United States under Trump, Europe’s core powers, and China. Each with their knives out, ready to carve the spoils.<br>*******<br>The Mechanism Taught Via Greek Tragedy<br>Greek tragedy moves hearts by evoking pity and fear. Tragic heroes like Oedipus and Antigone fall because of fatal flaws such as hubris, excessive pride that seal their fates. Aristotle taught us tragedy follows a strict arc: the protagonist rises, suffers reversal (peripeteia), recognizes their error (anagnorisis), then falls, bringing catharsis or a purging of societal tension.<br>These were more than entertainment, they were communal rituals. Through the suffering of heroes, audiences confronted fate, justice, and human limitations. Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex showed a man undone by a self-inflicted prophecy; Antigone revealed the clash between personal morality and tyrannical law; The Oresteia resolved cycles of vengeance through justice.<br>This tragic structure offers a powerful lens to understand Russia’s modern downfall.<br>Hubris: The Arrogance of Empire<br>Russia’s fatal flaw? Hubris. Pure and simple. Like Agamemnon sacrificing his daughter or Oedipus ignoring warnings, Russia’s imperial pride blinded it. Putin’s “Great Russia” rhetoric is the echo of kings who defied limits, whether divine or geopolitical. The catastrophic invasion of Ukraine was no accident, but the inevitable consequence of overreach.<br>Russia sacrificed its economic future and global standing for territorial conquest, much like Agamemnon’s reckless ambition cost his own kin. Like Oedipus dismissing ominous signs, Russia underestimated NATO’s resolve and Western unity, fulfilling a prophecy of self-ruin.<br>Hamartia: The Fatal Miscalculations<br>Russia’s Achilles’ heel is its dependence on fossil fuels as both weapon and lifeline. Sanctions and shifting global energy markets have crippled its economy. Corruption akin to the plague in Oedipus Rex permeates its institutions, weakening adaptation and innovation.<br>Worse, Russia’s gambit to fracture NATO and dominate Ukraine was its hamartia, its fatal error, and it unified the West instead. The brute force Russia counted on became the very cause of its isolation.<br>Peripeteia: The Reversal of Fortune<br>The 2022 invasion was Russia’s peripeteia or in English, the catastrophic reversal. Instead of restoring imperial glory, it turned Ukraine into a global cause célèbre, reduced Russia to a pawn in the U.S.-China rivalry, and exposed military and economic fragility. Like Oedipus, Russia discovered it was both predator and prey. Its “victories” now fuel marginalization.<br>Ukraine’s Defense Valley: Innovation Under Fire<br>Consider this: Ukraine’s defense sector isn’t just surviving, it’s reinventing warfare on the fly. Let’s call it Defense Valley. Hundreds of startups, young engineers, AI whizzes, and drone pilots in Lviv, Kyiv, and Kharkiv are cranking out cutting-edge tech while under bombardment. This isn’t your grandfather’s military-industrial complex. This is a fast, lean, and ruthless innovation engine fueled by state support, the army, and civil society all pulling in the same direction.<br>Engineering drawings move at internet speed to 3-D printers tucked away in basements and garages. This follows in the footsteps of the Gutenberg’s printing press, fax machines during the Polish Solidarity, the Blackberry during the 2004 Orange Revolution, Facebook during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, and WhatsApp encrypted messaging during the 2019 Hong Kong uprising.<br>Through Brave1, the government’s state-run innovation platform, battlefield needs feed directly into the labs and workshops. Ideas aren’t locked away in dusty R&amp;D departments for months or years. Instead, they’re tested in days. The battlefield becomes a real-time proving ground. What works? It scales instantly. Failures get discarded with brutal efficiency.<br>We’re talking about autonomous drones striking with surgical precision, AI systems that identify and prioritize targets in real time, UAV sensors that feed live intelligence, robotic de-mining land drones clearing the way, and mobile air defense units flexing where needed. Cyber defenses are hardened to withstand unrelenting Russian cyber assaults.<br>It’s no surprise that over €300 billion of frozen Russian assets are funneled here to not merely keep Ukraine standing, but to forge a new European security ecosystem. Think of Ukraine as spawning not one Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace but hundreds of smaller, faster, deadlier shops with Brave1 as the technology accelerator giving them scale and unstoppable momentum.<br>Russia may muster more soldiers, but Ukraine outpaces them in innovation and agility. It’s not just building more drones, it’s building a defense innovation system that Europe will depend on for decades. The future of war isn’t massed tanks; it’s smart machines and lightning-fast adaptation. Ukraine’s Defense Valley is a testament to that truth.<br>History won’t forget who bet on tomorrow.<br>Catharsis: The Feast on the Carcass<br>Global powers now seek catharsis through Russia’s dismemberment. The U.S. aims to force a pivot from imperial overstretch by weakening Russia to use as a tool against China. China plays the Greek Chorus while feigning neutrality but exploiting chaos like a modern Odysseus. Europe seeks a cleansing  redemption from centuries of Russian intimidation by dismantling Moscow’s power militarily and economically.<br>But the tragic irony is brutal: the “cleansing” risks sparking new cycles of conflict. China’s rise may spawn a harsher global order. Europe’s vengeance could ignite future Russian revanchism. And American complacency might embolden Beijing to seize global dominance.<br>The Chorus: The World as Spectators and Participants<br>Neutral states like India and Türkiye oscillate between condemnation and opportunism. The Global South watches warily, seeing Western “justice” as hypocritical. They worldly chorus judges Russia’s fate as a cautionary tale on the limits of power and morality.<br>Are We Underestimating the United States?<br>Amid the noise of Trump, partisan gridlock, and chaos, the U.S. retains a strategic core. Institutions like RAND and the National Security Council have studied Russia and China for decades. They understand the battlefield is as much about logistics, energy flows, and psychological pressure as it is about tanks.<br>Recent Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia’s infrastructure that are targeting radar, ammunition, and logistics hubs are surgical and precise. They reflect Western intelligence’s silent hand. NATO is shoring up the Arctic front where Russia’s fleets are weakest.<br>The real question is not whether the U.S. thinks strategically, it does. The question is: Are we minding our sacellum?<br>*******<br>Hybrid War: The Battle for Reality<br>This war isn’t just about tanks. It’s a war of narratives. Russia’s deadliest weapon is doubt: doubt about who started the war, doubt about the truthfulness of Western leaders, doubt about Ukraine’s worthiness, doubt about anything at all.<br>This is not a side effect. It is strategy. When truth dissolves into a swamp of lies and confusion, propaganda wins. People who once respected democracy now echo Kremlin talking points as useful idiots unaware of their role in this psychological operation.<br>Nelson Mandela faced propaganda by holding to the truth. Today, the battlefield is social media and comment sections, where democracy must be defended fiercely.<br>*******<br>Realpolitik: Oil, Gas, and Power<br>Energy is never just economics. It’s power, food security, stability, freedom, and war. As long as the West cuts fossil fuel production before alternatives are ready, the vicious cycle repeats: Russia profits, Ukraine suffers, and China smiles.<br>Europe builds gas plants; food production depends on gas-based fertilizers; and no matter what the enviros preach, air travel won’t vanish by 2040.

He needs the West as enemy. Peace shrinks him.<br>Trump wants “peace” as a branded deal likely forcing Ukraine to cede territory as a marketing move, not diplomacy.<br>Zelensky wants restoration of stolen lands not conquest and dignity and respect for international law.<br>Europe’s leaders want lasting peace that ends aggression, not freezes conflict.<br>The problem? Putin benefits from endless war. You cannot negotiate with someone who profits from chaos.  Vladimir Putin often portrays Russia as “antifragile” - a state that grows stronger under pressure. He frames Western sanctions, NATO “encirclement,” and internal unrest not as vulnerabilities but as stressors that forge national unity and sharpen strategic resolve. By controlling scarce resources (oil and gas), weaponizing economic shocks, and stoking regional conflicts, his regime seeks to turn each crisis into political capital: rallying domestic support, sidelining dissent, and projecting power abroad.<br>In practice, this means deliberately courting volatility like pushing geopolitical flashpoints in Syria, Ukraine, and the Arctic to expose Western paralysis and highlight Russia’s “sovereign resilience.” He invests in reserve financial buffers, builds parallel trade networks (BRICS +), and cultivates a narrative of perpetual siege that justifies ever-tighter state control.<br>Yet true antifragility requires optionality and decentralized robustness which are qualities Russia lacks. While Putin’s Russia can survive shocks, its heavily centralized, kleptocratic system struggles to harvest genuine upside from disorder. What he calls antifragility is often mere sturdiness under fire, not the dynamic growth through chaos.<br>Taking down the Russian Sacellum is the key to exposing its sturdiness under fire. The key is crossing the critical point universally known as the Ductile-to-Brittle Transition Temperature (DBTT). Below this temperature or energy level, a normally tough (“robust”), ductile material suddenly behaves in a brittle fashion. In other words, fracturing with little plastic deformation.<br>Once the Ductile-to-Brittle transition is crossed, there will no longer be any confusion that Russian lads are merely absorbing fire and do not represent a population that grows stronger with increasing tension. The truth will emerge suddenly and catastrophically.<br>Then there will be peace.<br>A Modern Oresteia<br>The Greek Tragedies still apply in the modern world. Russia’s tragedy is archetypal: hubris leads to nemesis. The world watches as Russia becomes the fallen Agamemnon, its corpse contested. The West will act as the Furies, torn between justice and vengeance. China will maneuvers like Odysseus, exploiting disorder.<br>These lessons from the Greeks still hold: power is transient, hubris universal. Without mercy, wisdom, and institutions to break the cycle, today’s aggressors are soon devoured by scavengers.<br>The only way to break an aggressive, self-styled antifragile Russia is to shatter its sacellum and obliterate the sacred core that fuels its imperial delusions. Let it bleed out in full view to generate catharsis through collapse. History doesn’t lie: true victory demands shared sacrifice, unflinching clarity, and a ruthless rejection of nostalgia and false greatness. Russia forfeited that choice long ago. We cannot afford to follow.<br>The ancients knew this.<br>*******<br>Smoke from the Altar: Rome’s Eastern Gambit and the Coming Crisis in Moscow<br>There’s smoke rising in the Vatican and not just from incense, but from the slow-burn signaling of a potential geopolitical and ecclesiastical realignment. The recent papal inauguration of Leo III, a ceremony that echoed with Greek chants and Orthodox ritual, was not just a gesture of ecumenical outreach. It was a calculated maneuver. The inclusion of Eastern rites and Greek liturgy at the heart of Roman tradition signals that something long unthinkable is now under active consideration: a reconciliation and perhaps even reunification between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.<br>The symbolic gestures seen in Leo’s inauguration weren’t for aesthetic effect. They were the Vatican’s version of a red flare over enemy waters. The message? Rome is looking east, and not just with nostalgia. It’s preparing the ground for something bigger, something strategic, something aimed squarely at the soft, clerical underbelly of the Russian state.<br>And here’s where the rubber hits the road: such a rapprochement isn’t viable under just any pope. It demands a specific theological scaffolding. Enter the Augustinians; a pre-Schism religious order with doctrinal DNA acceptable to both East and West. The order precedes the Great Schism of 1054 and carries none of the dogmatic baggage that has, for nearly a millennium, kept Constantinople and Rome estranged. More importantly, the Augustinian theological framework sidesteps the most contentious theological landmine of the divide: the Filioque.<br>The Filioque clause, Latin for “and the Son” was inserted into the Nicene Creed in the Latin West without ecumenical council approval. It declares that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son, whereas the Eastern Church maintains the original formulation: the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone. To Rome, it’s a clarification; to the East, it’s an innovation and a betrayal of conciliar consensus. That disagreement isn’t just academic as it helped rupture Christendom. An Augustinian pope offers a quiet off-ramp. Augustine’s Trinitarian theology emphasizes the unity of love and will between Father and Son without the procedural drama of double procession. In short, it allows both sides to save face, affirm orthodoxy, and keep the conversation going without cracking open dogma in the street.<br>Now, imagine a Vatican III. Yes, it’s a long shot. Yes, it will make traditionalists on both sides sweat. But the theological ice is already thawing. The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople has been long eclipsed in political relevance but is still first among equals in Orthodox hierarchy, is currently  in active dialogue with Rome. It’s the same patriarchate that recognized Ukraine’s autocephaly, directly undercutting Moscow’s ecclesiastical empire. A third Vatican Council could tackle not only East-West reconciliation, but the moral disarmament of postmodern Europe, the hollowing of the liberal branches Protestantism, and the need for a coherent Christian front against encroaching civilizational threats, be they jihadist, techno-nihilist, or neo-Marxist.<br>This is the nightmare scenario for Moscow. The Russian Orthodox Church is not merely a religious institution. It’s a division of the Russian state. Patriarch Kirill wears the robe of a cleric, but he breathes FSB air. The Kremlin has poured billions of rubles into building churches, training priests, and forging a spiritually legitimized Russian identity. From Kaliningrad to Kamchatka, gilded onion domes now rise as symbols of imperial rebirth. This church-building spree isn’t just piety. It’s statecraft. Putin has tied Russian destiny to Orthodoxy the way the tsars once did, using the Church to unite ethnic Russians, justify expansion, and resist the secular West.<br>But this massive investment is starting to backfire internally. Across Tatarstan, the North Caucasus, and pockets of Siberia, Muslim communities are growing increasingly resentful. They see the state’s hand funding Orthodox cathedrals while their own mosques struggle to get permits. Imams are monitored, while priests are exalted. The message is clear: in Putin’s Russia, Orthodoxy is not just the dominant faith, it is the only faith that matters. This is a recipe for slow-burn insurgency. Religious tension, suppressed for decades under Soviet atheism, is reemerging with teeth. If Moscow overreaches, and it already has, it risks lighting a fuse in its southern and eastern underbelly.<br>Back on the global chessboard, a Catholic-Orthodox reconciliation would rob Russia of one of its last uncontested instruments of influence. The ROC currently dominates Orthodox identity from the Arctic to the Aegean. That’s not just theology, it’s geostrategy. If Rome and Constantinople declare detente, Moscow loses its monopoly on the Orthodox brand. Already, Ukraine’s move toward ecclesiastical independence has fractured Orthodox solidarity. If that trend continues, Russia finds itself preaching only to itself, while the rest of the Slavic world pivots westward in both faith and politics.<br>And the ripple effects would be vast. A Rome-Constantinople axis would not only reframe Christian unity, but strengthen NATO’s soft-power flank. Religious diplomacy would reopen in Serbia, Georgia, and Armenia. Russia’s ideological claim to being the last bastion of true Christianity would collapse under the weight of a new ecumenical consensus. Even China, which has quietly cheered Russia’s religious nationalism as a model for its own ideological cohesion, would lose a partner in the global war of ideas.<br>So here’s the bottom line. When incense fills the Vatican and Greek echoes in the Sistine Chapel, it’s not liturgical nostalgia. It’s battlefield smoke. The Vatican is moving pieces with surgical precision. It’s reaching eastward, leveraging ancient orders like the Augustinians to create theological common ground, and preparing the table for something bigger, maybe even a Vatican III. Meanwhile, Moscow, bloated on its own ecclesiastical mythology, is facing the slow unraveling of its religious empire, with pressure building not just from the West, but from within.<br>This is not just about doctrine. This is about dominion.<br>The smoke has meaning. The Vatican is playing centuries, not cycles. And if you’re in Moscow or Beijing, you’d better start praying because this time, the altar is the battlefield.<br>*******<br>Plant Commissioning<br>power-plant-at-night1I work on the higher order edge of the economy, the edge that RINOs, globalists and those dirty-dog democrats sought to destroy. There are not as many voters to pander to, not out here where the iron ore is mined, the fiber is harvested, or the potash and ammonia are produced.<br>Ore isn’t your everyday consumer trinket. It is a high-order good in Austrian Economics terms. In the time-structure view of production, first-order goods land straight on the dinner table; ore sits several layers upstream, bound for smelting, forging, machining and assembly before it ever reaches a consumer.<br>That “roundabout” chain of processes supercharges productivity but also makes the economy razor-sensitive to shifts in interest rates and time-preferences. In short, ore from the mine isn’t a lower-order convenience; it’s a strategic input whose cost, availability, and allocation dictate the strength and the vulnerabilities of every link in the production chain.<br>The United States and Canada can crank raw‐material mining into overdrive, but our real bottleneck is intermediate processing, and it lags by roughly 2,000 percent. We’re talking about the critical screening, sorting, grinding, and heat-and-pressure operations that turn ore into usable feedstock.<br>If we don’t design and build processing facilities at a pace surpassing even the Manhattan Project, there is no pathway to genuine reindustrialization and mass production of everyday consumer goods. Meanwhile, China has funneled state capital into sprawling processing complexes, while our own environmental regulators and politicians have been busily shuttering these vital plants to clear land for condos and higher-tax-base immigrants.<br>With university graduation season upon us, I’m reminded of the advice I’ve given to every cohort of chemical engineers: lean into the hard, foundational work, the kilns, kilotons, and kilowatts of intermediate materials processing, because that’s where our nation’s future industrial might will be forged. If you don’t build the backbone, nothing else holds together. This is part of the commencemnt speech I gave to the Chemical Engineering Department at Western Michigan University a few years ago:<br>###<br>Listen up, kid. You’re fresh out of school, and maybe you think engineering is all about CAD drawings, Excel sheets, and meetings. You’re wrong. Real engineering happens on the ground, in steel-toed boots, with a notebook in one hand and a radio in the other.<br>If you want to build a career worth a damn, get on a team that starts up new industrial process lines. I’m talking about commissioning; the crucible where plans become operating plants, and engineers become battle-hardened professionals.<br>Commissioning isn’t just checking boxes. It’s a full-spectrum campaign; methodical, high-stakes, and rich in lessons no textbook can teach. It starts with verifying the design. You’ll tear through P&amp;IDs, specs, and standards with a surgeon’s eye, catching mismatches before they become million-dollar mistakes. You’ll argue with vendors, troubleshoot miswired sensors, recalibrate instruments until every system speaks the same language.<br>Mechanical completion? That’s your first line of defense. You’ll inspect welds, torque bolts, align shafts, and crawl inside equipment you only saw in schematics. Pre-commissioning? That’s where the details matter like cleaning, flushing, testing valves and switches until the system hums with readiness. Safety systems? You’ll test ESDs and relief valves like your life depends on it because one day, someone’s might.<br>Then comes the meat of it: integrated testing. No shortcuts. Air runs, water runs, dry rotations. You’ll simulate real-world conditions and chase down every gremlin in the controls. You’ll work elbow-to-elbow with electrical, automation, and process specialists, learning how systems really behave when they move from cold steel to hot operation.<br>Performance testing with live process? That’s the moment of truth. Now you’re pushing limits: temperatures, flow rates, throughput. When something goes wrong - and it will - you won’t just observe. You’ll solve.<br>That’s where careers are forged.<br>You’ll document everything: test results, drawings, compliance records. You’ll train operators and explain systems to those who’ll run them after you’re gone. That’s leadership. That’s legacy.<br>Commissioning teaches what no classroom can: discipline, precision, and how to stay cool when the heat is on. It’s not easy. But it’ll make you the kind of engineer people trust with the hard problems.<br>You want to matter in this profession? Start things. Light the fire. Turn and burn. Commission the line.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R131" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">132</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TRUNG CỘNG LẠI CHO TỶ PHÚ ĐƯỢC ƯU ĐÃI – THEO Ý ĐẢNG!<br>Phân tách của Victoria Herczegh trên Geopolitical Futures:<br>https://geopoliticalfutures.com/in-china-billionaires-return-to-favor-on-the-partys-terms/?tpa=ODY2ZTY1NWVkZWU4M2FiMjNkNGY5MzE3NDk3NDM0NTg2ZDI4YTM&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fgeopoliticalfutures.com%2Fin-china-billionaires-return-to-favor-on-the-partys-terms%2F%3Ftpa%3DODY2ZTY1NWVkZWU4M2FiMjNkNGY5MzE3NDk3NDM0NTg2ZDI4YTM&amp;utm_content&amp;utm_campaign=PAID%20-%20Everything%20as%20it%27s%20published<br>IN CHINA, BILLIONAIRES RETURN TO FAVOR - ON THE PARTY&#39;S TERMS<br>(By Victoria Herczegh - Geopolitical Futures - May 30, 2025)<br>Chinese President Xi Jinping has extended an olive branch to the country’s wealthiest private entrepreneurs after years of subjecting them to scrutiny and regulatory crackdowns. In a recent symposium, Xi reassured billionaire business leaders that Beijing is committed to supporting private enterprises. Since then, some previously sidelined figures – most notably Jack Ma of Alibaba – have resumed public appearances, speaking at conferences and universities about the importance of China’s high-tech modernization drive. Many of these events are now funded by the central  government, a sharp contrast to recent years when top businesspeople were quietly warned to avoid the spotlight, or to publicly endorse the government’s “common prosperity” campaign if they did appear.<br>Now, not only are these entrepreneurs encouraged to speak publicly, but they are also being afforded new legal protections: China’s first law promoting private enterprise has just come into effect. This shift is intended to stimulate both technological innovation and domestic consumption. Still, within China’s socialist system, being a billionaire remains fraught with risk. Party priorities override all else, and even with new legal protections, China’s billionaires must tread carefully. Xi’s change of stance is driven by urgent economic needs: revitalizing a slowing economy, boosting employment and building resilience against U.S. trade restrictions through technological self-reliance.<br>RISING TIDE TO CRACKDOWN<br>It may seem surprising that a communist country such as China permits the rise of billionaires. Under Mao Zedong, the accumulation of vast wealth was incompatible with the prevailing ideology of class struggle and wealth equality. Deng Xiaoping, however, shifted the paradigm by introducing market reforms to revitalize China’s stagnating planned economy. He promoted slogans like “to get rich is glorious” and encouraged individual success as a means to national prosperity. But it wasn’t until the 2000s that China began producing U.S.-dollar billionaires in significant numbers. From 2000 to 2010, some 60 individuals reached that threshold. Under Xi, the goal of “common prosperity” resurfaced, emphasizing equitable wealth distribution and addressing the disparity between coastal regions and the poorer interior. Despite this, China’s billionaire class ballooned to about 400 by the end of the In China, Billionaires Return to Favor – on the Party’s Terms 2010s. By 2025, the Hurun Global Rich List recorded 823 Chinese billionaires – second only to the United States. (China actually briefly surpassed the U.S. last year.) This rise underscores China’s economic dynamism, but also poses a perceived threat to the Chinese Communist Party’s control.<br>Most of these billionaires built their wealth through private enterprises, an anomaly in a nominally communist state. Deng justified their existence by arguing that individual wealth would lift broader society through job creation and innovation. Today, private businesses account for more than 60 percent of gross domestic product, 80 percent of urban employment and more than 70 percent of technological innovation. While full communism – complete wealth equality – remains a distant goal, Xi aims to achieve “socialist modernization” by 2035, which includes narrowing income gaps. The 2020-22 crackdown on the super-rich, particularly in tech and finance, was part of this broader agenda. It was also a response to perceived political risks posed by influential business figures.<br>Jack Ma’s experience illustrates the hazards. In 2020, he publicly criticized China’s financial system during a speech in Shanghai. Days later, the IPO for Ma’s Ant Group was halted, and Ma disappeared from the public eye. He reemerged in 2022, reportedly teaching in Tokyo. His downfall marked the start of a wider crackdown on high-tech sectors. Officially, this was about fairness and redistribution, but political control was a driving factor. COVID-19 accelerated the trend, highlighting the growing dependence on digital platforms. Another target was Colin Huang of online retailers Pinduoduo and Temu, who resisted aligning publicly with the common prosperity movement and was likely pressured to step down as chairman.<br>By 2022, the leadership began pivoting from crackdown to “normalization,” softening oversight and offering support to private enterprises. This was driven by strategic needs – notably tech self-reliance in the face of U.S. restrictions – and the recognition that private firms are key to economic recovery and youth employment. Xi also acknowledged that wealth redistribution efforts had not meaningfully closed regional or class disparities. While the common prosperity narrative persists, economic growth has reemerged as a top priority.<br>GROWTH OVER (ALMOST) EVERYTHING<br>Despite the softer approach, private investment and hiring remained weak into 2024. Business leaders remained cautious, maintaining a low profile. This changed when Xi held a widely publicized summit with top entrepreneurs, including Ma. The event signaled a sincere shift in tone. Facing U.S. pressure to restrict China’s tech development, Beijing has turned back to private sector innovation, especially in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and other advanced technologies. Compared to state-owned firms, private enterprises are more efficient and responsive to market dynamics.<br>Recognizing this, Xi began to ease regulations and reengage with business leaders.<br>The most concrete sign of this shift is the new private enterprise law, effective as of May 20. It pledges to address systemic imbalances, promising equal treatment for private and state-owned firms, better market access and improved credit availability. It also targets “profit-driven enforcement” by local officials, who would illegally seize assets to fill gaps in the local budget. The central government plans to curb such practices through oversight teams and disciplinary measures. It will also increase fiscal transfers to struggling regions and reform tax distribution to reduce pressure on local governments. Although these steps have been promised before, this law offers detailed legal guarantees for the first time. The law also mandates that state entities treat private firms as equal legal entities, protecting them from arbitrary penalties and forced closures. Still, resistance from local governments burdened by debt is likely, setting up potential conflicts between central and regional authorities.<br>These developments suggest that the Chinese government now sees private enterprise as vital for economic recovery and innovation. The new law may also signal to foreign investors that China is open for business under more predictable conditions. Premier Li Qiang has repeatedly said China welcomes foreign firms and aims to offer attractive investment terms.<br>However, China has not fully returned to Deng’s ethos of celebrating wealth. The Chinese Communist Party wants to harness private-sector dynamism without relinquishing control. Billionaires now enjoy more public visibility, but their actions remain closely monitored. They are expected to support government initiatives and avoid flaunting their wealth. Those who cross the line may be ousted or see their firms restructured. Still, with Xi betting on the private sector, a sweeping new crackdown is unlikely. Entrepreneurs in sensitive sectors like tech, finance or media will face tighter scrutiny than those in less political industries. For instance, Zhong Shanshan [Chung Thiểm Thiểm, sinh 1954], chairman of the bottled water company Nongfu Spring, has quietly become China’s richest man, with a net worth of $65.9 billion.<br>Xi’s approach echoes Deng’s in one key respect: Private wealth is tolerated – even encouraged – so long as it serves national goals like tech self-sufficiency and job creation. But China’s billionaires must remember that their wealth and status are contingent on political loyalty. The new protections are real but conditional. In Xi’s China, entrepreneurs can thrive – as long as they never challenge the party’s authority.<br>Author: Victoria Herczegh</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R132" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">133</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/31/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ĐƯỜNG LỐI ĐỐI NGOẠI CỦA CHẾ ĐỘ LÝ TÀI:<br>Tiền tài là có lý nhất nên Chính quyền Trump có chánh sách đối ngoại nguy hiểm, do vị trí mập mờ hàng hai của xứ Qatar chuyên yểm trợ khủng bố Hồi giáo.

But regarding Qatar, the Trump administration appears to be pursuing effectively the same extremely dangerous policies that endanger not only US allies in the Middle East such as Israel, but the United States itself.<br>* &quot;[US] colleges and universities have accepted $6.25 billion from Qatar since 2001. However, Qatar&#39;s total spending likely exceeds that figure... Qatar is a major exporter of Islamist ideology, which it amplifies on the Qatar-owned Al Jazeera network.

A document from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, notifying Congress of the initially approved sale, stated:<br>    &quot;This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East.<br>    &quot;The proposed sale will improve Qatar&#39;s capability to meet current and future threats by providing timely intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, target acquisition, counter-land, and counter-surface sea capabilities for its security and defense. This capability is a deterrent to regional threats and will primarily be used to strengthen its homeland defense.&quot;<br>According to Natalie Ecanow, of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD):<br>    &quot;If the sale is completed, Qatar will be the first country in the region to purchase these advanced drones, which possess an advanced suite of sensors and can employ a variety of munitions.&quot;<br>While it is understandable that President Donald Trump is eager to bring business deals to America, since when has Qatar been &quot;a friendly country that continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East&quot;? The answer is: Never.<br>A quick look at what exactly Qatar does, and still is, reveals that for decades, Qatar has cultivated a close relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood, whose motto is:<br>    &quot;Allah is our objective; the Prophet is our leader; the Quran is our law; Jihad is our way; dying in the way of Allah is our highest hope.&quot;<br>Qatar has been the main financier of Hamas, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, to the tune of up to $360 million a year.<br>&quot;Qatar is the leading sponsor of terrorism in the world, more than Iran,&quot; said Dr. Udi Levy, a former senior official of Israel&#39;s Mossad spy agency who dealt with economic warfare against terrorist organizations.<br>In the US, a key internal Muslim Brotherhood document, &quot;An Explanatory Memorandum,&quot; was revealed during the 2008 Holy Land Foundation Trial. This memorandum, discovered by the FBI in 2004 among the archives of Ismail Elbarasse (a Brotherhood archivist), outlines the Brotherhood&#39;s strategy for the United States. <br>The document explicitly states:<br>    &quot;The Ikhwan [Muslim Brotherhood] must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and &#39;sabotaging&#39; its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God&#39;s religion is made victorious over all other religions.&quot;<br>The phrase &quot;by their hands&quot; refers to the Brotherhood&#39;s stated intention to use America&#39;s own institutions, freedoms, and legal systems to undermine it from within, rather than by overt violence. The strategy is to infiltrate and manipulate existing structures - media, government, academia, and civil society - so that the transformation is achieved using the mechanisms of the host society itself.<br>Qatar&#39;s media empire, Al Jazeera, is the mouthpiece for the Muslim Brotherhood. It is this Arabic-language television network that has spread the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood throughout much of the world. Even Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which agree on virtually nothing, both banned Al Jazeera – as have Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Bahrain.<br>In 2017, Israel&#39;s then Communications Minister Ayoob Kara said:<br>    &quot;Lately, almost all countries in our region determined that Al Jazeera supports terrorism, supports religious radicalization. And when we see that all these countries have determined as fact that Al Jazeera is a tool of the Islamic State [group], Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, and we are the only one who have not determined that, then something ludicrous is happening here.&quot;<br>Kara also said, &quot;Freedom of expression is not freedom to incite.&quot;<br>John Mirisch, chief policy officer of the Israeli-American Civic Action Network, wrote in March 2025:<br>    &quot;For way too long, Qatar and Al-Jazeera have been peddling propaganda as &#39;journalism,&#39; with much of the propaganda aimed at the Arab world in an effort to destabilize the region, whip up Main Street sentiment against Israel, and to derail the Abraham Accords. Any criticism of Hamas or the Muslim Brotherhood on Al-Jazeera is strictly forbidden....&quot;<br>There is hardly an Islamic terrorist group, in fact, that Qatar does not support.

We will never succumb to the darkness. O Jerusalem, rise up, rise up. Revive the memory of al-Qassam. O Jerusalem, shoot flames of fire.&quot; Al Thani has referred to former Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh as &quot;brother prime minister&quot; and in 2021 he offered: &quot;Israel&#39;s control of the U.S. is clear. We must plan how to influence the decision-makers in the U.S.&quot;<br>Qatar has more than succeeded in influencing decision makers in the US, as shown by America&#39;s offer last year to have Qatar manage shipments through a US-built floating pier on the coast of the Gaza Strip, which would have delivered weapons to Hamas along with humanitarian aid and would have preserved the terrorist organization. The pier quickly collapsed due to stormy sea conditions. Now the US is offering Qatar a new weapons deal.<br>What this gift to Qatar shows is that Trump seems to be selecting some people who are offering terms that publicly make the president look ridiculous - whether for Iran to be allowed to enrich uranium for &quot;peaceful purposes,&quot; or accepting that the International Atomic Energy Agency alone might inspect Iran&#39;s nuclear and missile facilities in a possible future deal.<br>While negotiating with Hamas for the release of Israeli hostages, Trump&#39;s special envoy Steven Witkoff - who was bailed out by Qatar in a $623 million hotel deal - praised Qatar by saying that the terrorist-supporting Gulf state was &quot;doing God&#39;s work.&quot;<br>The Trump administration, in seeking to make America great again, was supposed to move away from the policies of the Obama and Biden administrations, which appeased terrorist and rogue states such as Iran and Russia. But regarding Qatar, the Trump administration appears to be pursuing effectively the same extremely dangerous policies that endanger not only US allies in the Middle East such as Israel, but the United States itself.<br>The Trump administration has thankfully made it clear that it will refuse visas to foreign students who are Hamas supporters, but at the same time, the administration is arming Hamas&#39;s financial backer.<br>US Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) said in January 2024:<br>    &quot;The Qatari government spends uncountable billions of dollars promoting and even funding the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and other terrorist groups. They have either bought or intimidated huge parts of Washington, D.C., into silence. It&#39;s not at all surprising they would consider the few remaining outspoken opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood in Congress to be Qatar&#39;s enemies. It is long past time for the U.S. to reevaluate the U.S.-Qatari relationship.&quot;<br>Whatever happened to that badly needed reevaluation?<br>Other Senators unfortunately are shilling for Qatar. US Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) recently said that &quot;Qatar has been a great ally to America,&quot; while feigning ignorance of Qatar&#39;s insidious influence on US university campuses through its donation of billions of dollars. Marshall insinuated that Qatar&#39;s massive funding of American academia is benign instead of appearing to have led to the wave of antisemitic protests and riots on US campuses since the October 7, 2023 massacre of Israeli civilians.<br>According to testimony given on April 2, 2025 by the FDD&#39;s Natalie Ecanow to the Texas Legislature House Committee on Homeland Security, Public Safety &amp; Veterans&#39; Affairs:<br>    &quot;[US] colleges and universities have accepted $6.25 billion from Qatar since 2001. However, Qatar&#39;s total spending likely exceeds that figure... Qatar is a major exporter of Islamist ideology, which it amplifies on the Qatar-owned Al Jazeera network. By pumping money into the American higher education system and across the United States, Qatar avoids scrutiny as it advances hostile ideologies.&quot;<br>&quot;Qatar is currently the largest foreign donor to US universities,&quot; according to a recent report by the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP).<br>    &quot;Despite its close ties to the United States and other Western countries, Qatar has also built an extensive network of Islamist partners dedicated to expanding its influence. It hosts, supports, and represents the Muslim Brotherhood; maintains ties with Iran; hosts the Taliban; has supported and maintained an office for Hamas and its exiled leadership; and has backed militias in Syria and Libya.&quot;<br>The influence that Qatar has bought extends far beyond colleges and universities and into K-12 schools, according to ISGAP.<br>    &quot;This report examines the Choices Program, a national education initiative for K-12 social studies curriculum housed at Brown University that combines licensed curriculum units, free online content, and professional education workshops to provide a range of resources for secondary school classrooms. The program, used by 8,000 schools in all fifty states, reaches over one million students...<br>    Analysis of program materials, particularly those concerning the Middle East, reveals concerning patterns:<br>    • Progressive delegitimization of Israel through content changes across editions;<br>    • elimination of key historical context and balanced perspectives;<br>    • downplaying of significant diplomatic achievements like the Abraham Accords;<br>    • introduction of increasingly partisan theoretical frameworks;<br>    • systematic changes in terminology and map presentations...<br>    Our investigation identified significant discrepancies between Brown University&#39;s public statements and documented evidence regarding external influence over the Choices Program, including:<br>    • the understated relationship with QFI;<br>    • the misrepresentation of the nature and extent of QFI&#39;s involvement in workshop content, teacher engagement, and curriculum distribution;<br>    • the lack of transparency concerning donor influence on content development.&quot;<br>Qatar is hard at work, subverting the United States. Right up there with it is China, also infiltrating American K-12 education.<br>Trump recently issued an executive order requiring transparency in the foreign influence on US campuses, emphasizing that it would address Chinese and Qatari activity in American academic institutions, but it will take much more than that to reverse the decades of foreign Qatari and Chinese propaganda that have permeated US campuses, especially the Ivy League.<br>It seems oddly schizophrenic to have one branch of the US government going after Qatari influence in academia, while another US government branch is selling the Qataris lethal drones with which it could theoretically supply to Hamas, ISIS and other terrorist groups to wreak havoc in the Middle East and beyond.<br>Now it seems that Trump&#39;s commitment that, &quot;As long as I am President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon,&quot; is in danger of turning into pabulum as well.<br>It is high time for the United States to free itself of the subversive forces working to destroy it from within, especially if America is to remain a beacon of freedom in the world, let alone &quot;making it great again.&quot;<br>A good place to start would be not to sell weapons to Qatar and not to pretend they are a friendly ally. Instead, the US should start looking for an alternate place, such as the United Arab Emirates, to relocate American forces from Qatar&#39;s Al-Udeid Air Base.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R133" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">134</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/30/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">CUỐI TUẦN… HÃY ĐỌC VUA DAVE:<br>Dave ở đây là David Bahnsen của The Bahnsen Group, doanh nghiệp tư vấn về đầu tư.

The reasons I have always declined these requests to address this topic include:<br>    I am not ever going to be King for a day,<br>    We do not have kings in this country, let alone for a day, so it becomes daydream fantasy to even entertain.<br>    I am more focused from a portfolio management standpoint on what is, what I think will be, and what I think could be – whereas the “king for a day” stuff is consciously and purposely fantasy-land stuff, and therefore a little unproductive.<br>Well, all three of my above reasons still apply, but I have decided to succumb anyway.  All I can say before I throw out a few policy suggestions to address the problem of excessive government indebtedness is that:<br>    These things will not happen (or at least most of them, and at least not in the way I describe).<br>    Whatever does happen requires a certain political realism, and these were written as if the context were a hypothetical “Dave-land” – not the real political world of our republic.<br>But as long as we’re playing make-believe, let’s have some fun with it.  In today’s Dividend Cafe, we’ll explore a few ideas for addressing the need for improved economic growth and containing runaway debt and annual deficits.  This one is going to be fun.  Let’s jump into the Dividend Cafe!<br>Download Podcast Transcript<br>The Heart of the Matter<br>I do not care about government spending as much as I care about the portion of our economy that government expenditures represent.  I expect Apple to spend more money on overhead than Graham’s Lemonade Stand, so the expenses themselves as an absolute dollar amount do not tell us the whole story.  The same goes for the debt level.  The spending as a portion of the economy ought to be our obsession.  Some government spending is an absolute necessity in a civilized society.  We have made promises to retirees.  We need a military to secure our common defense because “we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns.”  We need a court system.  There are certain legitimate government functions that cost money.  It is true that a wide dispersion of beliefs exist about how vast those functions ought to be.  Some favor a wider and larger net for the legitimate functions of the federal government, and some (yours truly included) favor a more robust civil society that is built around a limited federal government and stronger local and state oversight.  Today’s Dividend Cafe is not getting into the political philosophy of federalism, localism, or a constrained vision for Washington, D.C.  The economic math is our main focus.<br>In the 1950s, government spending was 17% of GDP.  It stayed just 18% all the way through the 1960s.<br>The 1970s, 80s, and 90s saw it linger right around 21%.  The 1970s were weak in terms of economic growth.  In the 1980s, GDP grew substantially but defense spending also ramped up to defeat the Soviets in the Cold War. The 1990s saw an average of 21%, but that is deceiving because it started the decade at 22%, and in a recession, but ended the decade at just 18%, due to reduced defense spending and substantial economic growth in the second half of the decade.<br>In the 2000s the ratio stayed around 20% but government spending increased a great deal, and the financial crisis at the end of the decade weighed heavily on the denominator (GDP contracted), followed by an increase in the numerator (government spending increased in the aftermath as part of standard post-war Keynesian medicine).<br>This led to the move higher in the 2010s, where government spending (annual deficits now routinely higher than we have ever seen) became 23% of GDP, led by a governmental spending surge post-COVID, much of which seems now embedded in the cost structure of the economy.<br>As I try to repeat as often as I can: More than the absolute level of nominal debt (nearly $37 trillion), what matters most in terms of quality of life, economic growth, and productivity, and general standard of living (prosperity) is the ratio of government spending to GDP.  The higher that ratio, the less productive output is taking place in the economy, and that productive output is where the good things sustainably happen that lead to jobs, wages, new goods and services, innovations, and other exciting things reasonable people would call “wealth” and/or “quality of life.”  Regardless of what one believes about the legitimate size and scope of government, the productive, wealth-building, and value-creating components of economic activity take place outside the governmental sector.  That does not mean the government expenditures are always bad or always wasteful – sometimes they are necessary – but they are less productive than what we could expect from the private sector, where the profit motive, specialized knowledge, and deep incentives exist.  The robust creativity, knowledge dispersion, and innovative capacity in the private sector have produced tens of trillions of dollars of real wealth, and so the more resources we put into the governmental sector, the less we put into the private sector, and the less productivity we get.<br>For today, the hypothetical question is “what would I do to decrease government spending (and debt)” (the numerator) and “what would I do to increase economic growth” (the denominator).  That is the subject of this week’s Dividend Cafe.<br>The Caveat that Makes this All Moot<br>I alluded to this in my introduction, but I want to make as clear as I can what this is and what it isn’t … I am not doing serious policy work here because serious policy work would dig deeper into the political realities that severely limit what can be done at all.  I believe a lot of these things are doable, some are not at all, and some would require modification and qualification to become possible.  But what has to be front and center in any objective to improve our debt-to-GDP ratio is (a) Reducing debt, and (b) Growing GDP.  So if someone else has a different objective (not interested in reducing debt or growing the economy) they will want a different path.  But my goal is to present ideas that are all focused on those two objectives (some on one, some on the other, and some on both).<br>How Bad is It?<br>The debt held by the public is currently 100% of GDP – essentially a $29 or $30 trillion economy with $29 or $30 trillion of debt owed to the public.  If we counted inter-governmental debt, we would be at 123% (but there are legitimate reasons to limit our calculation of debt-to-GDP to that debt held by the public.  So, at 100% debt-to-GDP, where do we go from here?<br>In less than ten years, the CBO projects we will be at 122% of debt-to-GDP, and that is without the pending changes expected to add $2-3 trillion to the debt over the next ten years.<br>In 2019, we inexplicably ran a $984 billion budget deficit. I say inexplicable because the economy was very good and we were not at war and COVID had not started yet.  For the last few years, we have been running $1.8 trillion deficits, which come off the COVID years, when we ran $3 trillion deficits in 2020 and 2021.  So, 2022, where the deficit was “only” $1.4 trillion, looks like the fiscally responsible year in these last five or six years.  As I sit here and write this, I really can’t believe what I am typing.<br>Deficits are explained by the difference between revenue and expense, which is about as intelligent a sentence as saying that weight gain is a by-product of calories burned vs. calories consumed.  On the spending front, over the last few years, our interest expense has certainly increased (+1.4% as a % of GDP), but defense spending as a % of GDP has actually decreased.  The growth has been in mandatory spending, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.<br>Over the last 25 years, about 8% of the legislation that has increased spending has been Republican, 12% Democrat, but nearly 80% bipartisan.  In other words, none of what I am alleging about the source of debt and spending is partisan – quite the contrary.<br>When B and B Didn’t Stand for Big and Beautiful<br>I will start with one of the most traditional, vanilla, doable, and wise ideas imaginable – a Balanced Budget Amendment.  It is not really comprehensible to most Americans that this is presented as such an outlandish idea.  I mean, some families and some businesses have some years where their revenues are less than expenses, but it is essentially rare, never sustainable, and never commendable.  Every family, every individual, and every business knows: the ideal state is, wait for it, to spend less than you bring in. <br>I will be the first to say that even a fiscal hawk like yours truly would support the legislation allowing for flexibility in certain emergencies – declared wars, severe recessions where revenues unexpectedly drop (due to declining tax base), etc.  But to dismiss the entire idea because of perceived exceptions that have not been exceptions in 65 years – they are the rule – is disingenuous to the core.  We had one year with a budget surplus since 1960 (1969) until the last time we had it, which ran from 1998 to 2001.  Those surpluses in the late 1990s, behind a growing tax base and shrinking expense structure, actually caused the media to ask the Presidential candidates in the year 2000 (Bush and Gore) what they were going to do with all the excess money?<br>25 years later, that question seems more and more, well, removed from reality.<br>One of the arguments supply-side friends of mine make against the balanced budget amendment is that it could force Congress to raise taxes to meet their required end outcome.  But of course, this is not an argument – tax increases are less popular than expense reductions; Congress and Congress alone has the incentive to reduce expenses if they are to avoid the wrath of voters that is unleashed from tax increases.  A Balanced Budget Amendment forces the issue and can be written with the needed flexibility for true emergency situations.<br>So Dave-Land step #1: A Balanced Budget Amendment<br>Getting Attention the Hard Way<br>Congress will not pass it, but I would couple the Balanced Budget Amendment to a law that said anytime the national debt is running over 100% of GDP, the statutory pay for all electeds in Congress goes to $36,000 per year, and all staff must work as unpaid volunteers.  Since no one in America relies on their staff more than the members of Congress, that latter stick might hit harder than their 80% reduced salary.<br>I stole (then modified) this idea from David Malpass, recent president of the World Bank and a senior Treasury Department official under Trump 1.0, Bush, and Reagan.  The idea is that Congress can cheat a little on a balanced budget amendment by telling their models things about revenue or expenses that are not true, so that the budget balances on paper, but by tying financial repercussions into actual debt-to-GDP, it minimizes gamesmanship.<br>I do not believe this will ever happen, and I do believe that if it did, it would work.<br>Dave-Land step #2: Congressional pay impact when debt-to-GDP exceeds limits<br>Low-Hanging Fruit<br>The unfunded liability aspect of our budgetary mess is the one that we are constantly told is the “third rail” of American politics.  We have seen it in the Medicaid discussion of the last month, and for years and years around social security.  And people prefer to be lied to with what they want to hear instead of being told the truth about what would fix it.’<br>Without boring you all with countless details and minutiae, I will simply say that no effort to cure the fiscal situation of our country is serious if it does not tackle social security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  The promises we have made are unsustainable and so the issue is not “what can we do that avoids any pain” but rather “what pain will be most tolerable relative to other pain.”  In Dave-land, I would do the following as it pertains to Social Security:<br>    Change the eligibility age for benefits to 68 for anyone between 50 and 59, and to age 70 for anyone under 50.<br>    Eliminate annual cost-of-living adjustment for anyone with over 150k of income.<br>    Offering one-time buyouts to people over certain asset thresholds at the age of eligibility at a significant discount to the net present value of their real guaranteed stream of benefits.  This “bowl of stew” in lieu of birthright offer makes good on a moral promise, is voluntary and not compulsory, puts a little money in the pockets of people whose retirement cash flow is not dependent on it, and most importantly, would be designed to save trillions of dollars of payment liabilities.<br>Dave-Land step #3: Social Security Reform<br>And Medicaid?<br>Simply put, phase out in five years or less any use of Medicaid outside of its congressionally-approved purpose- that of emergency funding for medical care for the destitute.  Medicaid was designed for those in poverty, and has become something never imagined in its original intent.<br>It would take me another 5,000 words to expand on all of this, but to implement work requirements (besides for the disabled), to strictly enforce eligibility, to shift more responsibility to state and local governments, and to implement various cost reduction programs that have previously been rejected would all substantially decrease the economic cost of Medicaid and its impact on our debt and spending picture.<br>Dave-Land step #4: Medicaid Reform<br>Making Medicare Pencil Again<br>The conversion of Medicare to a premium support plan would fundamentally alter the economics, saving hundreds of billions of dollars in a reasonably short period of time.  Providing users of medicare money to purchase a plan instead of being the plan (voucher-like) increases competition, drives costs down, changes incentives, and likely facilitates people selecting plans more appropriate to their own situation, versus the no-skin-in-the-game waste the current system facilitates.<br>This idea of Medicare as a premium support instead of its own plan makes so much sense that I can guarantee you this is the least likely to ever happen.<br>There are a million other things that can be done to reduce costs and reallocate funding, but I am trying to avoid that level of granularity (and boredom).  But the massive change that a premium-support approach would represent fundamentally changes the picture of what is the single largest liability of the American taxpayer.<br>Dave-Land step #5: Medicare Reform<br>A Tax Cut that is a Tax Increase<br>The capital gain rate on assets sold after they have been held one year or longer is 20% (where income is over 500k, give or take a few bucks depending on whether one is filing single or married).  So, if I propose that Congress pass a “super long” capital gain tax rate for assets held ten years or longer of 8% (or 10%?), that sounds like a tax cut, right?  Well, not exactly.  The actual tax rate paid on the vast majority of assets held over ten years is … 0%.  The reason?  Ten years or longer is a long time to compound a very large return, and because of the step-up in basis that people receive at death (for their heirs), very, very few people sell assets at gigantic gains after holding for ten+ years.  Not always, but the vast majority of the time, they end up holding, receiving a step-up, and the heirs pay … ZERO capital gains.<br>So is the goal here just to drive a higher tax base by incentivizing people to pay 8-10% tax on these super gains as opposed to 20% (and it is really 23.8% because of the 3.8% surtax for the Affordable Care Act)?  Not exactly.  It is true that this will INCREASE revenue to Treasury (8-10% is higher than 0%, and well over half of 10+ year holding periods result in holding an asset to the point of step-up).  But far more than that, this is so, so crucial, as it puts an end to the stagnant capital that is held in an incumbent asset instead of being redeployed to a new project, new venture, new real property, new idea, and new growth initiative.  In other words, the capital gain laws as they stand now incentivize people holding DEAD and STALE money, to avoid a tax hit.  I see it every single day.  Incentives are incentives.  Psychology is what it is here.  People understandably find the tax cost of keeping their investments dynamic too big a cross to bear, and end up biasing static versus dynamic investment ideas.<br>An 8% capital gain tax on assets held over ten years would be a palatable or acceptable tax burden for many (versus 23.8%), it would be higher than the 0% Treasury receives now when assets are held until death (where a step-up occurs), and it would unlock significant capital formation that would foster investment in dynamism – not a stale hold in stagnant assets while the clock runs out.<br>This checks both the revenue and economic growth boxes.<br>Dave-Land step #6: A “super long-term” capital gain rate of 8-10% <br>A Rules-Based Fed<br>To foster maximum economic productivity, I would seek to limit the interventions and distortions from the Federal Reserve that have created malinvestment, misallocated resources, and resulted in sub-optimal growth.  These interventions are, in my estimation, generally well-intended, yet in creating malinvestment, they simply do more damage than good for economic growth as the subsequent purge of wasteful investment weighs on economic growth.  It is so tempting to look at the emergency measures the Fed took post-2008 and assess the success of those policies on the immediate lift out of the financial crisis, and to not further assess the perpetual effects as policies lingered for years and years thereafter.  My view is that financial repression harms economic growth; that is, artificially low interest rates and other forms of monetary accommodation (excessive QE) incentivize financial engineering over capital spending.  A rules-based Fed would allow for a lender of last resort and some consistent yardstick that can be used by economic actors in doing economic calculations.  The results may involve a worse hangover when a purge of excess is required, but will also involve a quicker restoration of normalcy, growth, and sound business judgment free of distortions.<br>To summarize, a rules-based Fed is positive for economic growth because it (a) Limits distortions which lead to malinvestment and poor resource allocation, and (b) Incentivizes productive investment over leverage and engineering.<br>Dave-Land step #7: A rules-based Fed<br>Growth by Deregulation<br>I understand DOGE was supposed to do some of this, but really DOGE had more to do with efficiency within the government, and as it stands now, the chaotic style around much of it and troubles they have had with their own reporting and website have made it very hard to track progress and substance.  But as much as I fully favor a relentless pursuit of better efficiency within government, I am here referring to something else:<br>Deregulating the private sector.<br>Here, I suggest benefits to states that prioritize their own deregulation needs for their private sector.  And along those lines, I suggest states provide benefits (incentives) to cities and counties that do the same.  In other words, a national obsession with cutting red tape to make it easier to do business at the city, state, and federal levels.<br>I love the 2-for-1 mantra, whereby any new regulation must first be accompanied by the elimination of two other regulations.<br>I favor an intense defederalization of regulation, whereby so much of what falls under the executive branch is localized.<br>Look, I am not saying much here.  The only meat on the bone is the 2-for-1 idea and a national program to reward states for their own deregulatory efforts.  But the greatest cost to a business is not taxes but regulation, and the greatest hurt we face in excessive regulation is not cost but stunted growth.  Regulations subsidize the big and powerful, creating stagnation as “little guys” and “pioneers” cannot launch.  It is anti-progress and anti-growth, and it hurts the denominator of our debt-to-GDP ratio.<br>Dave-Land step #8: Deregulation via incentives to states, federal priorities, and 2-cuts-for-1 addition program<br>Budget Cuts by Slashing Cronyism<br>This would just be obnoxious to go through in detail, but in Dave-land, the federal government would not be in the business of subsidizing businesses, any businesses, and so it would make everyone mad.  Some would like the elimination of clean energy subsidies, and some would be furious.  Some of the same people would be furious at the elimination of subsidies to other aspects of the energy sector, and some would love it.  My goal here is not to make friends or favor sectors I like more than others.  It is to foster economic growth through the elimination of cronyism, to get the government out of the business of picking winners and losers, and to broaden the revenue base by giving companies and individuals fewer opportunities to create arbitrage in the tax code.<br>I would implement a 15% business tax rate on pure profits, with all expenses eligible as legitimate business costs.<br>Dave-Land step #9: Elimination of governmental favoritism in the tax code<br>Dave-Land step #10: A 15% corporate income tax rate with all expenses treated equally<br>Last But Not Least<br>A robust commitment to energy independence that treated our energy assets as the geopolitical, environmental, and economic assets that they are.  I would seek an “all of the above” energy policy that sought to make the world a customer, and represents 0.5% of additional GDP growth per year for the foreseeable future.<br>Dave-Land step #11: Energy as an economic growth engine<br>Recap<br>For those keeping score at home, or just looking for the cliff notes:<br>    Pass a balanced budget amendment<br>    Cut Congressional electeds’ salaries to a literal minimum wage and make staff positions voluntary if debt-to-GDP exceeds 100% (I would be fine with 90%)<br>    Social Security reform via phased eligibility, means-testing COLA, and severely discounted buyouts<br>    Medicaid reform by restoring the program to its eligibility intent and evolving shift of the burden to states<br>    Convert Medicare to a “premium support” plan.<br>    Set a “super long” capital gain rate of 8-10% to incentivize selling long-held capital gain assets before the step-up at death takes place, unlocking capital formation of productive investment.<br>    A rules-based Fed to limit malinvestment and spur productive growth<br>    A national deregulation campaign<br>    Elimination of government favoritism in the tax code<br>    A 15% corporate income rate with all expenses treated equally – ALL expenses<br>    An “all of the above” energy policy with a focus on exports<br>Quote of the Week<br>“The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.”<br>~ F.A. Hayek<br>* * *<br>I don’t know if this scratches any itches or not, and I do know many others have done actual serious work in the policy domain that might, possibly, one day see the light of day.

In return, the U.S. would agree to a 90-day tariff truce. He agreed to the demand in the final hours of marathon discussions with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, the people said.<br>In the resulting deal, both sides suspended most of the tariffs they had imposed on each other - drawing cheers from global investors and businesses.<br>Since Geneva, however, Beijing has continued to slow-walk approvals for export licenses for rare earths and other elements needed to make cars, chips and other products. <br>On Friday, President Trump, along with his trade representative, called out Beijing for not fulfilling its commitments. <br>U.S. and Chinese officials meeting in Geneva.<br>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, left, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer were in Geneva for trade talks with China. Photo: martial trezzini/keystone/eda/Reuters<br>“China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,” Trump wrote on his social-media platform Truth Social. Shortly afterward, Greer said China is “slow-rolling” its compliance with the agreement, mentioning rare-earth minerals as a sticking point.<br>For He, Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s economic gatekeeper, the willingness to comply with China’s rare-earth pledges faltered after the U.S. Commerce Department on May 12 issued a warning against the use of Huawei Technologies’s Ascend artificial-intelligence chips “anywhere in the world,” the people said.<br>Beijing viewed the warning as renewed U.S. aggression, and complained about it to Washington.<br>Trump officials then told He’s team that the Ascend guidance was a restatement of U.S. policy, the people said, and that China needs to do what it had agreed to. Such messages have so far failed to sway He and Xi. Beijing has kept on stonewalling approvals of such licenses.<br>The account, previously undisclosed, explains why the Geneva accord is now teetering on collapse. The U.S. and China are moving to fight an economic warfare on widening fronts, with both sides seeking to gain leverage in new, nontariff ways.<br> The Trump administration’s remarks Friday came as many U.S. companies, in particular automakers, have complained to the administration that Beijing has been slow to approve export licenses for rare-earth minerals, which are crucial in multiple components of modern cars. If China doesn’t speed up those approvals, companies have warned the White House, auto plants may have to idle in pandemic-style stoppages, according to a person with knowledge of the communications.<br>Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the China-UK Financial Services Summit.<br>China’s chief trade negotiator, Vice Premier He Lifeng. Photo: florence lo/Reuters<br>Shortly after the talks in Geneva, some Trump administration officials involved with the trade talks privately conceded there was a chance China would renege on key details of the deal, with U.S. officials keeping an eye on the rare-earth minerals component of their agreement, according to people familiar with the matter. <br>In Beijing, officials view the export-licensing system, which was put in place in early April, as a powerful new weapon against the U.S. - and important leverage in trade negotiations.<br>For now, the process to get high-level trade talks going has stalled. Bessent told Fox News on Thursday that a call between Trump and Xi might be needed to break the impasse. “I think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other,” Bessent said. The two last spoke in January, right before Trump’s inauguration.<br>On Friday afternoon, Trump told reporters that he will speak to Xi, adding he hopes the two leaders will “work it out.” <br>The Trump administration was already readying a trade-war Plan B after a court this week threw its tariff strategy into disarray. Any interruptions in tariffs because of the court’s ruling would hurt Trump’s leverage in ongoing trade talks with Beijing. <br>In response to what it says is China’s noncompliance with the Geneva accord, the Trump administration has further tightened export controls on the sale of high-tech products to China, including, according to the people familiar with the matter, those needed to make C919 commercial airliners - Xi’s pet project - and certain software Chinese companies need to design chips.<br>Model of a COMAC C919 passenger aircraft at an aerospace exhibition.<br>The C919 commercial airliner is President Xi Jinping’s pet project. Photo: hector retamal/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images<br>In a statement, Liu Pengyu, spokesman at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said China recently “has repeatedly raised concerns with the U.S. regarding its abuse of export control measures in the semiconductor sector and other related practices.” Liu said China urges the U.S. to “jointly uphold the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva.”<br>At the same time, the administration is conducting a series of investigations into China’s unfair trade practices and their potential threats to U.S. national security. Those probes could lead to higher tariffs on Chinese pharmaceuticals and other products, potentially offsetting a recent court ruling that seeks to block most of Trump’s tariffs.<br>In another sign of intensifying tensions between the two world powers, the Trump administration announcement earlier this week that it would “aggressively” begin revoking visas for Chinese students in universities across the U.S. China’s Foreign Ministry has called the move “politicized and discriminatory.”<br>Beijing views all these recent actions as part of Trump’s effort to dial up pressure on China for future trade negotiations. Chinese officials involved in the Geneva talks also have expressed a willingness to continue to engage with their U.S. counterparts, according to the people familiar with the matter.<br>But so far, Beijing has shown little sign of budging.<br>“The U.S. turned away from the negotiating table and immediately intensified its pressure on China’s semiconductor industry,” said a commentary posted Wednesday on the social-media account of the Communist Party’s influential journal Qiushi, or Seeking Truth. “This shows that resolving trade issues won’t happen overnight.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R135" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">136</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/30/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỘT BÀI RẤT NÊN ĐỌC KỸ…<br>Hôm nay, 30 Tháng Năm, đích thân Chủ tịch Hội đồng Bang giao Quốc tế (Council for Foreign Relations) là Michael Froman giúp mọi người hiểu thêm khía cạnh pháp lý của trận Thương chiến bằng cách tham khảo giới chuyên gia.

Chứ nếu lại bàn để phô diễn cái dốt thì chớ buồn: sẽ được mời ra chỗ khác!<br>https://www.cfr.org/expert/michael-froman?utm_source=twtw&amp;utm_content=20250530&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=TWTW2025May30&amp;utm_term=TWTW%20and%20staff<br>The World This Week May 30, 2025<br>By Michael Froman President, Council on Foreign Relations<br>The judicial branch has entered President Donald Trump’s trade war, creating even more uncertainty in an already chaotic environment. <br>This Wednesday, a three-judge panel at the Court of International Trade (CIT) unanimously struck down all tariffs imposed by Trump under the auspices of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), which included Trump’s Canada, Mexico, and China tariffs, as well as all Liberation Day tariffs. The CIT’s decision, which found that Trump exceeded the authorities granted by IEEPA, is the most consequential potential setback for the president’s trade agenda to date.<br>As expected, Trump’s team has already lodged an appeal and secured a temporary stay of the ruling, which will allow Trump’s IEEPA tariffs to remain in place through at least June 9. (Tariffs that Trump imposed by relying on other legal authorities on products such as aluminum and steel were unaffected by the ruling.) To hedge while the appeal process plays out, the administration could very well pursue a variety of other authorities beyond IEEPA, including Section 301 (unfair trade practices) and Section 232 investigations (national security) to impose country- and product-specific import duties. It may also impose temporary 15 percent tariffs under Section 122 on the basis of the United States’ balance of payments.<br>However, these workarounds will take time to implement and could be subject to further legal wrangling. I expect most of the administration’s ongoing trade negotiations to enter a holding pattern as our trading partners wait for the courts to digest the administration’s appeal. Trade ministers around the world will also hope, likely in vain, that the CIT’s ruling may curb the president’s love of tariffs. For better or worse, it’s been all too easy to forget that there is more to trade policy than presidential decrees. This week’s ruling is a reminder that the judiciary and Congress still have a role to play, even if Trump eventually leverages other authorities to implement a tariff regime akin to the Liberation Day plan. <br>To further unpack the CIT’s ruling and its implications for the Trump administration’s trade policy strategy, I asked several of CFR’s leading experts to share their analysis.  <br>1/ Edward Alden, senior fellow, analyzed the significance of the CIT’s ruling and its historical parallels.  <br>This will go down as one of the most important court decisions in U.S. history. Far from being just a narrow ruling against the tariffs, it is a powerful, definitive statement about the separation of powers and limits on the president’s authority. With President Trump announcing new tariffs almost daily on social media, it is easy to forget what the Constitution says: the power to levy tariffs rests solely with the Congress. The CIT reminds us clearly: “[A]n unlimited delegation of tariff authority would constitute an improper delegation of legislative powers to another branch of government.”<br>More specifically on President Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs,” the court notes explicitly that Congress in the 1974 Trade Act completely barred the president from using emergency powers in response to trade deficits. It is hard to see a higher court overturning this judgment. <br>The ruling may also have implications beyond trade and economics. It is one of the clearest judicial statements ever on the limits of the president’s “emergency” powers. It finds explicitly, for example, that the use of emergency tariffs to gain “leverage” over Mexico and Canada on drugs and illegal migration was not clearly authorized by Congress and is therefore impermissible. In doing so, the court has checked the increasingly expansive claims by presidents - not just the current one - that declaring an “emergency” confers unlimited powers to the president. <br>The CIT rightly quotes the famous Yoshida II case on President Nixon’s 1971 imposition of tariffs under a previous law granting emergency economic authority. The words are more powerful than ever in our current moment: “The mere incantation of ‘national emergency’ cannot, of course, sound the death-knell of the Constitution.” <br>2/ Rebecca Patterson, senior fellow, analyzed how markets here in the United States reacted to the CIT ruling. <br>The early financial market reaction to the court ruling was noteworthy. U.S. government bond yields rose, with the thirty-year Treasury yield climbing above 5 percent. This administration has been planning to use tariff revenue to help fund the budget package currently going through the reconciliation process. Less tariff revenue suggests a greater need for greater bond issuance to cover the deficit. U.S. bond yields that settle at higher levels, ultimately, will act as a drag on economic activity and growth. As the tariff story continues to evolve, it’s important to stay focused on the interplay between trade and fiscal policy and their implications.<br>On a related note, the U.S. dollar continues to struggle. This reprieve on tariffs seems unlikely by itself to change global investors’ desire to diversify their financial exposures at least marginally away from the United States. A weaker dollar adds to inflation somewhat and could moderate any monetary policy easing ahead. <br>3/ Benn Steil, senior fellow and director of international economics, argued the CIT ruling was a longtime coming. <br>The CIT ruling should be seen in the wider context of the relentless growth in assertions of executive authority, most notably under IEEPA, over many decades - and in particular since Donald Trump’s first term. Resistance from the supposedly co-equal  judicial and legislative branches - a Madisonian blowback, if you will - is long overdue. <br>In addition to the administration’s inevitable appeal of the decision, we can expect tariffs to be re-imposed under alternative executive authority - most notably so-called “Section 232” (national security) and “Section 301” (unfair foreign practices). Negotiations with other countries will be even more chaotic than they’ve been, as the legality of Trump’s ever-changing tariffs - and the deals made to reduce them - could take months to sort out. <br>4/ Brad W. Setser, senior fellow, assessed the future use cases for Section 232 or Section 301. <br>The CIT has struck down, for now, President Trump’s ability to threaten sky high tariffs on a whim. The ability to raise tariffs on China to 145 percent (and then lower them to 30 percent) and the ability to threaten the European Union (EU) with 50 percent tariffs with almost no notice rested on the ability to use the IEEPA as an all purpose tool to raise or lower tariffs. <br>The CIT, correctly in my view, thought IEEPA was a bridge too far for a statute that was intended to apply to true emergencies, and historically has been used for sanctions. America’s trading partners recognize that the President is a true tariff man, and that he has multiple legal avenues for new tariffs. The Section 232 cases now in place or in process will potentially cover about 40 percent of U.S. trade, or around 4 percent of GDP in trade. For Europe, the threat of 25 percent tariffs on autos, aviation, and pharmaceuticals matters more than the 10 percent universal tariff -and the same is true for South Korea (autos and semiconductors), Japan (autos and products that use semiconductors) and Taiwan (semiconductors). In all probability, additional 232 cases could be developed - heavy industrial equipment ties directly to military mobilization, chemicals are needed to manufacture explosives. <br>The existing Section 301 case against China can easily support the reimposition of 30 percent tariffs - call it “phase one enforcement.” It would not be hard to generate a new 301 case against Vietnam, a non-market economy still run notionally by a communist government with a massive export assembly business.  <br>The 10 percent base tariff covered about 7 percent of GDP in trade, as oil and North American trade were excluded. Replicating that level of coverage with 232s and 301s is imminently doable. It will just take more time, a lot more process and won’t allow the president the same ability to raise or lower tariffs over a weekend without any real capacity for interests that would be adversely affected by tariff shifts to provide comment. In other words, the trade war will slow down - and any really extreme outcome becomes a bit less probable.<br>5/ Jonathan E. Hillman, senior fellow, analyzed the potential national security risks of widespread use of Section 232. <br>Unless the lower court’s decision is overturned, President Trump may turn again to one of his favorite tariff tools: Section 232, which allows the President to adjust imports that threaten to impair national security. Trump has already initiated fourteen Section 232 cases, almost three times more than any other president. There are three cases for tariffs that are already in place (steel, aluminum, and autos), and four cases where no action was taken (uranium, titanium sponge, transformers, and vanadium). Seven additional investigations are underway: copper, lumber, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, trucks, critical minerals, and commercial aircraft/jet engines.<br>The risk of unintentional harm to U.S. national security rises without exemptions to these tariffs. The U.S. defense industry relies on tariff-free access to steel, aluminum, copper, and other inputs. As tariffs raise costs for these inputs, margins for a range of companies that support the defense industrial base will be squeezed, including small- and medium-sized businesses deeper in the supply chain. And because most tariffs are ultimately passed to the customer, the U.S. government will be effectively charging itself more to arm and equip the U.S. military. Section 232 is a powerful tool that must be used with care. Otherwise, the U.S. government may find itself paying more for less security.<br>6/ Matthew P. Goodman, distinguished fellow and director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies, pointed to what to expect from the United States’ major trading partners.  <br>The May 28 court ruling on IEEPA may have surprised major U.S. trading partners but is unlikely to change their incentive to seek early trade deals with the Trump administration. For countries like Japan, Korea, and members of the EU, Section 232 tariffs on key products of export interest - notably automobiles, steel, and semiconductors - pose a more immediate threat than the reciprocal tariffs announced under IEEPA. <br>On cue, Japan’s chief negotiator returned to Washington on Thursday for the second time in less than a week to meet with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Tokyo is still hoping to strike a deal before the G7 Summit in Canada in mid-June that includes rollback of the 25 percent tariff on autos. Despite the new uncertainty around reciprocal tariffs, expect negotiators from other major countries to follow soon. <br>7/ Inu Manak, fellow for trade policy, wrote earlier this week about the appeals process and what to expect as Trump seeks to get his agenda back on track. <br>&quot;CAFC has traditionally been more deferential to the president on issues involving national security. For example, in litigation over the first Trump administration’s aluminum and steel duties, the CAFC ruled in 2021 that the president has broad discretion to modify tariffs. The difference here is that this earlier ruling was in response to Section 232, not IEEPA.<br>That means that this appeals court decision and other similar questions about the president’s tariff authority may not affect the current case because of how Section 232 powers differ. For example, IEEPA doesn’t even use the word “tariff” to describe actions that the president can take. Furthermore, as I detailed earlier this year, the predecessor statute to IEEPA - the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act - faced litigation under the Richard Nixon administration. The CIT cited this case, which determined that a president’s action needed to have an “eminently reasonable relationship” with the declared emergency, in its ruling on Wednesday.<br>The standard for using IEEPA to levy tariffs may therefore be different than in the case of Section 232 duties. The particular issues raised by IEEPA are explored in more detail in an amicus submission by my CFR colleague Jennifer Hillman. The bottom line is that the Trump administration’s approach to trade policy has faced its first major obstacle, revealing the potential limits of executive authority over trade. Trump may finally have pushed too far.&quot; </td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R136" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">137</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/30/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">AI ĐÃ… ‘TỰ SÁT’ PHẠM NHÂN JEFFREY EPSTEIN TRONG TÙ?<br>Vụ phạm nhân Jeffrey Epstein đã tự sát trong khu trọng cấm của một nhà tù kiên cố vào năm 2019 đã gây nhiều nghi vấn, vì đương sự là tâm điểm của một mạng lưới ấu dâm có lắm thân chủ khét tiếng quốc tế, kể cả Tổng thống Bill Clinton.

(Andrew Harnik via Getty Images)<br>Trump plays a game of chicken. The White House doles out fishy pardons. Democrats get all masculine. Elon departs D.C. The Macron slap. And much more.<br>(By Nellie Bowles - The Free Press - 05.30.25 - TGIF)<br>Welcome back to your week in review. My only housekeeping announcement is that new merch has hit the store just in time for those who use “summer” as a verb or live in the White House: Free Press golf balls. Please add your best tagline for them in the comments.<br>→ I can’t afford a pardon: The White House vending machine is giving out pardons this week! Scott Jenkins, a Virginia sheriff convicted of conspiracy, fraud, and bribery for accepting piles of cash in exchange for letting rich folks have fake sheriff’s badges, got a Trump pardon. So did reality show stars and fraudsters Todd and Julie Chrisley, who’d initially been sentenced to 12 and 7 years, respectively, for conspiring to commit bank fraud and (obviously) conspiracy to commit tax evasion. And a random tax criminal has also been pardoned - right after his mother gave Trumpo $1 million at a fundraising dinner. That gentleman had been ordered to pay the state $4 million restitution alongside his prison sentence, so the $1 million payment to the president is a better deal in many ways.<br>At this point, paying your taxes directly to the Trump family is a better deal and probably safer than using the IRS. Trump wanted to slash red tape, and slash red tape he has. Now he just puts a briefcase on the table and nods. I pay my cleaning lady in cash, and that’s how I will probably pay my taxes now too. Every April, I will throw wads of dirty bills in a brown paper bag, scrawl my Social Security number (666-66-6666) on it, and leave it at Tiffany Trump’s door. How do I calculate what’s owed? Well, it’s based on my income, of course, plus extra in my case for being a blue state libtard and for not losing the baby weight. Deductions offered for pictures of a local ballot showing Trump written in for every option, especially library board; being a guy with beer cozies and acceptably strong biceps because we need more of you fellows; and being a woman with anything above a B-cup. I get two of three deductions this year!<br>After Trump held a crypto dinner last Thursday night, crypto moguls who paid to be there felt scammed that the president didn’t even stick around at the event they’d hoped to do their own scams at. I saw someone describe him as the apex scammer. Our Scammander in Chief. Give me a pen and a ballot for the Upper West Side library committee because I need to add one more name.<br>→ Vlad, why would you be so nuts? The president is baffled by Vladimir Putin’s recent behavior, writing on Truth Social: “I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY! He is needlessly killing a lot of people, and I’m not just talking about soldiers.” Our Vladster, killing civilians? Acting kooky? That’s not the dictator I know and love. Trump added: “Likewise, President Zelensky is doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.” That part I understand. He’s a jealous man, and when someone steals his shtick, you best watch out.<br>Trump seems to really hate war, so he probably genuinely believes he can post his way out of it. And let’s see. It’s not like Biden’s way of standard American forever-war methodology was working in Ukraine, which was a shock to me because that way worked so well elsewhere in the past. Like, I can’t imagine missing a ski season on Afghanistan’s Koh-i-Baba slopes and ending the day with a glass of Iraqi Freedom wine at my favorite bar off the Dick Cheney Expressway. Anyway, keep posting at him, Trumpo. If that doesn’t do it, then we’ll tag in the nuclear weapon team (Hillary Clinton on her second Scotch) to put an end to this and all of Eastern Europe. It’s getting to be enough already.<br>In other Russia news, a new statue of Joseph Stalin in a Moscow metro station was unveiled this month. President Putin has called Stalin an “effective manager,” and has said that enemies of Russia use the “excessive demonization” of Stalin to attack “the Soviet Union and Russia.” Stalin is back, big time. Interesting that “effective manager” is being used here to describe a man who facilitated the death of millions - and not efficiently. But I’m not a businessman.<br>And in final presidential news, a Financial Times-coined acronym for Trump has been taken up on Wall Street and it is: TACO. As in: Trump Always Chickens Out. Like, don’t worry, he’ll drop the tariffs. TACO! When asked about this new phrase in a press conference, the president was furious: “Don’t ever say what you said, that’s a nasty question. To me that’s the nastiest question.” Later he added: “They will say, oh, he was chicken, he was chicken, that’s so unbelievable.” Being asked about the phrase TACO is the nastiest question? Well, there goes my sit-down with the president.<br>→ Have you met Pete? The new macho, bearded, chill, and cool Pete Buttigieg is here. Gone is the paternity leave–taking, gay pride–touting trans-portation secretary. And, like every good presidential candidate, he’s signaling that it’s okay to throw the old Dems under the bus. Asked what he would have done differently in 2020 he said, right off the bat: “One, for the love of God, figure out a way to get the schools open sooner. We got very knee-jerk about this, and. . . the costs were profound.”<br>I hate to say it, but it was a great answer and I’m starting to like my all-American Mayor Pete again. Beep beep, a little pinch to my neck, a new SIM card just installed, and it’s Pete! Except this time he’s wearing his military fatigues. I’m all in. Hands up if you can’t wait to see how Chasten decorates for Christmas!<br>On cue, Taylor Lorenz, voice of the American progressive, one-time star of The New York Times before The Washington Post poached her to be their star before getting so big she started her own site, had this to say: “Pete saying he would have ‘opened the schools sooner’ in 2020 aka killing MORE vulnerable people faster, sacrificing teachers and educators (and kids!) lives to force them back into unventilated buildings w[ith] no protections. Disgusting how Dems have fully embraced far right eugenics.” This is my bat signal. Moderates, get on your tandem bikes. It’s Pete o’clock. The vibe is: We’re gay, but not too gay. Open the schools.<br>→ The State Department has a. . . Substack: The State Department is blogging on Substack. As if our competition wasn’t hot enough, now we have to deal with the literal State Department. If you don’t restack their posts they’ll designate you as a foreign terrorist; if you comment with anything negative, they’ll send you to El Salvador. Very similar to the TGIF comment moderation policies. They’re now writing about how World War II created a new world order based on “global liberalism” that is destroying Western civilization, which is exactly what I was going to write this week. The State Department continues: “Our hope is that both Europe and the United States can recommit to our Western heritage, and that European nations will end the weaponization of government against those seeking to defend it,” which was pulled directly from our Mission page. They even write about how thousands of Britons have been arrested for online posts. It’s edgy analysis that tiptoes right up to the line (like, innovative use of describing America and Europe’s shared “familial ties” instead of race). Anyway, keep an eye out for these up-and-coming center-right Substackers. I won’t know how I feel if the State Department makes us one of their recommended publications until it happens, so let’s check in next week.<br>→ The continued reckoning: A postmortem on Kamala Harris’s campaign cited a “perception gap” as one of the reasons she lost, saying voters believed she held positions that she didn’t. “Over 80% of swing voters who chose Trump believed Harris held positions she didn’t campaign on in 2024, including supporting taxpayer funding for transgender surgeries for undocumented immigrants (83%), mandatory electric vehicles by 2035 (82%), decriminalizing border crossings (77%), and defunding the police (72%).” But Harris had, in fact, supported all of these positions. Like, she is on record supporting each of those positions (here, here, here, and here). So it’s not really a perception problem so much as a reception problem, like these ideas are not popular even though I support them. There’s a sense among Dems that people should simply ignore the things that are unpopular and that referencing them is fake news. Like, how dare you talk about the surge of migrants coming through our new open borders thanks to swift changes from the Biden admin. Yes, it’s technically true, but it’s disinformation-coded.<br>And finalized polling data from Trump’s victory was posted this week, so now we have the exact numbers on everything. Between 2020 and 2024, Trump gained 6 percent of black voters, 11 percent of Asian voters, and 21 percent of Hispanic voters, while gaining only 2 percent of white voters. Hispanics and Asians. Mainstream media spent years blaming white guys sitting at random Midwestern diners only for the big reveal to be Hispanics and Asians. That noise you hear is a stampede of 23-year-old New York Times reporters heading to Chinatown and Spanish Harlem to ask about how exactly they internalized that much white supremacy, how they assimilated so strongly in the wrong direction. I’ll write your lede, guys: “While standing at the taco truck, one could hear the calls of mi hombre and mi hermano. Unspoken that day: mi hermana.”<br>→ Musk lashes out at the “big, beautiful bill”: During an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, Elon Musk commented on the huge new Republican spending bill. He said he feels “disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decrease[s] it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.” He said that “I think a bill can be big, or it could be beautiful. But I don’t know if it could be both.” It cannot be both. A bill is like a woman, and cannot be both smart and pretty (I’m kidding, don’t yell at me). I will say that I had high hopes for DOGE, despite the fact that this meant pinning hopes to someone named Big Balls. But to those balls my dreams were pinned, genuinely. So this is all pretty sad. Speaking of balls, just a reminder to buy ours, in case you forgot already. See ya on the green!<br>More on the CIA’s Star Wars fan website, a professor of honesty fired for fraud, a slap to the face of France’s president, and much, much more. But first: a cartoon from Mr. David Mamet.<br>→ Leave Bruce alone: A bar in New Jersey canceled a performance by a Bruce Springsteen tribute band after the real Springsteen called Trump “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous” while on tour in England. Citing the bar’s MAGA clientele, the bar owner said that a Springsteen cover band would be “too risky at the moment.” And: “Whenever the national anthem plays, my bar stands and is in total silence, that’s our clientele. Toms River is red and won’t stand for his bull—.”<br>My conclusion: All political groups can be snowflake babies. All men yearn to see blood in the streets. See, I absolutely love Bruce Springsteen, and sure, I find his photo shoots and podcasts with Obama to be a little cringe, as the kids say, but I also don’t care. Politics shouldn’t get in the way of enjoying “Tunnel of Love,” a goddamn masterpiece. I take my neutrality seriously. We’re blasting the new Ye banger in our house right now. Art knows no borders! (Weird, I have no idea why the preschool teachers just requested an urgent meeting.)<br>→ CIA ran a Star Wars fan site: The CIA secretly ran a Star Wars fan site to covertly communicate with overseas informants, according to an amateur security researcher. 404 Media (a fabulous tech news site) discusses the research and how “typing a password into the ordinary looking websites’ search bar actually triggered a login process for sources to then communicate with the CIA.” The site is apparently one of many the CIA operated, and frankly, I’m impressed at the skill level and whimsy of our federal government here. My question is what other niche nerd communities are run by the spooks. Obviously, all Magic: The Gathering groups. But I have a friend who’s really into the knitting community, and she goes to yarn shops wherever she travels. Do I need to ask her for more specifics? Is The Free Press a black ops site? Help!<br>→ Honesty professor fired for fraud: Harvard officially fired Francesca Gino, who studied honesty and ethical behavior, after the university accused her of data fraud. Gino, who was one of Harvard’s highest-paid employees, making over $1 million a year, manipulated data to better support her research. And who first discovered this fraud? The boys at a little behavioral science blog called Data Colada, run by Uri Simonsohn, Leif Nelson, and Joseph Simmons. The key takeaway here is not that a star has fallen but that so much behavioral “science” is fake. If you want to know about human nature, you don’t need a study. We’re not that unique or complex. Just sit quietly and imagine the worst version of yourself (Lustful? Envious? Proud?). Would you steal the cookie and lie about stealing it? You would. There’s your Harvard PhD in behavioral psychology.<br>→ China testing the vibes of colonialism: China unilaterally declared that certain disputed zones in the waters between China and South Korea were “no-sail zones.” The zones, at least partially designated for military exercises, went into effect last Thursday and were scheduled to end this past Tuesday. As the Trump administration flirts with the “multipolar world” vision that the Kochs and the Soroses have been pushing for years, we’ll start to see some of the new poles in action. That action looks like China taking Taiwan, for sure, but maybe also South Korea, just a little bit. For a sense of the intellectual underpinning of this movement, check out the Quincy Institute, launched with funding from (yes) Charles Koch and George Soros. TGIF obviously wants a unipolar world that bends around America, and ideally around me. My children already know where the no-sail zones are in our house (the entire house, minus their playpen).<br>→ Emmanuel Macron gets slapped: Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, got shoved in the face by his wife Brigitte Macron. Footage taken of the couple standing by an open plane door showed Brigitte manhandling her husband. Macron’s aides first said that the video was AI-generated and disseminated by Russian accounts, my go-to excuse when caught shoplifting on CCTV. Once the video was authenticated, the Élysée Palace said the video portrayed a “moment of togetherness.” It’s how I display tenderness, too. With both hands, I grab my subject by the jowls and shove them. They did meet when he was 15 and she was 39. So there’s a lot going on there already, and I really don’t want to know that much more about their sexual dynamic.<br>→ Economics R so hard: New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is proposing a sweeping new policy: rent freezes! So everyone’s rent freezes right where it is, or it will be tased. I don’t have the energy to explain all the reasons this ends up making housing more expensive, but I shouldn’t have to. I was told that the dawn of AI would make us more intelligent, and yet here I am, presented with this charismatic and nonsensical mayoral candidate who has made every effort he can not to understand basic economics. Meanwhile, the group Youth Against Displacement has put out a perfect video explaining that: “Supply and demand is NOT how housing works.” Pray tell, why? Okay, the video answers that, but it’s a bad answer. Bad socialists! Bad! Stop doing this. Male Oprah: Go back to Albany.<br>→ No more grades: The San Francisco Superintendent of Schools was hoping to see what might happen if we just said YOLO and gave everyone A’s. A new “Grading for Equity” plan for the city’s students led to a wave of criticism this week. The plan included things like eliminating homework and weekly tests from counting toward final grades (which would be determined by one final exam that students can take multiple times). Students could submit assignments late or not show up to class at all, and it wouldn’t affect their grades. They could score as low as 80 and receive an A. Why not!<br>There is a dark notion on the left that some children just can’t be taught skills like fluent reading. That it’s unfair and mean and racist to force all kids to take the same math test if outcomes on exams fall along demographic lines. The writer Wesley Yang reminded me of the best illustration of this. A few years ago, progressive superstar Jamaal Bowman, then a congressman, posted a cartoon of different animals (including a fish, a monkey, a penguin, a dog, and an elephant) facing a teacher who says: “For a fair selection everyone has to take the same exam: Please climb that tree.” On the political right, this movement is known as “Human Biodiversity.” It’s all a bit fatalistic for me. Amid the backlash, San Francisco is now pausing the “everybody gets an A” program. . . at least until people stop paying attention.<br>→ Univeral Basic Income fails again: Now it’s just getting sad. The National Bureau of Economic Research found that income had no impact on any measure of childhood wellness and development, per a big new study. Researchers gave $333 a month to one set of impoverished families and $20 a month to a control group, then tracked whether the cash reduced the developmental gap between poor children and better-off children. No impact. At all. On anything. It’s honestly really strange. But it’s the perfect justification I need to spend more and spend now rather than save for the kids to have an inheritance. Anyway, it just leads back to fatalism: Maybe the behavior patterns of the middle class are the key, not the money itself. But then, how do you explain a wealthy yet dysfunctional family? Much to mull here. Need to call my dad about this one.<br>→ Things that are not antisemitism: The Democratic Socialists of America “Liberation Caucus” has announced its support for Elias Rodriguez, the suspect arrested for slaughtering two Israeli Embassy staffers outside D.C.’s Capital Jewish Museum last week. Here’s the statement signed by the DSA Liberation folks and a bunch of others: “As imperialism has made the entire world its battlefield, it is justified to fight it, by any means necessary, without regard for geography.” And: “[T]here must be consequences for genocidal [Z]ionist imperialism, and those consequences are righteous.” Chants of resistance is justified are the new cool thing in Chicago. And the major anti-Zionist protest group Unity of Fields is officially transitioning into “A MILITANT FRONT AGAINST THE US-NATO-ZIONIST AXIS OF IMPERIALISM.” Militant means their plan is to kill more. So, anyone who has ever said the Passover prayer that ends with Next year in Jerusalem, well, we’re all fair game. The killings are anti-Zionism, though, not antisemitism, write mainstream lefty thinkers. It just happens to be that Judaism keeps bringing up Israel. Have you considered not saying prayers? And a leader of the Palestine Writes festival is posting about how there is no such thing as the Jewish people. You learn new things every day.<br>Meanwhile, Wired, whose reporters always refer to The Free Press as dangerous, published this how-to on building your own gun in honor of an accused vigilante killer:<br>→ Tate Brothers face criminal charges in the UK: Andrew and Tristan Tate are facing a total of 21 charges in the UK, including rape, actual bodily harm, and human trafficking. The pair first faced charges in Romania, where they were placed under house arrest for several months. The more recent charges date from incidents between 2012 and 2015, before their move to Romania. Andrew and Tristan said they “categorically reject all charges” and are “very innocent men.” The men who travel the world talking about beating women seem to treat women pretty badly, all around the world. Nothing funny here, just a nod of approval to the UK authorities for finally trying to arrest someone worthwhile.<br>→ Always remember to remember remembering: Manchester United recently posted this: “On 22 May 2017, something tragic happened in our city. We will always remember those who were lost on that day.” And they included a black square that reads: “Always remembered. We will never forget.” That’s it. No details. Well, honestly I’d already forgotten and needed to Google it. Oh, riiight. A British-born Islamist set off a bomb at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena, killing 22 people. Or, just a random day to randomly remember. We will never forget. Hold space in your mind to grasp the tragedy. Don’t think too hard, though, about what it was.<br>→ King Charles doing a land acknowledgment for land he could give up: From his throne in Canada (so based), King Charles began his speech with a land acknowledgment. Yes, by the Grace of God, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of His other Realms and Territories said the following: “I would like to acknowledge that we are gathered on the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg people. This land acknowledgment is a recognition of shared history as a nation. While continuing to deepen my own understanding, it is my great hope that in each of your communities and collectively as a country, a path is found toward truth and reconciliation in both word and deed.” The man who is literally the King of Canada. Whose empire rests on his people having been the OG greatest colonialists to march this earth. Sir, you live in Buckingham Palace. I promise you, you do not want truth and reconciliation in both word and deed.<br>And if you’re stressed about anything between now and next week, remember: TACO.<br>TGIF brought to you by the crew you know and love: Sean Fischer, Olly Wiseman, Suzy Weiss, Natalie Ballard, and Ryan Chowdhury.<br>And where do you TG?

That’s unhelpful to the administration.<br>Kimberley A. Strassel<br>(By Kimberley A. Strassel - WSJ - May 29, 2025 - Appeared in the May 30, 2025, print edition as &#39;Vance Courts Trouble for Trump&#39;.)<br>image<br>U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Las Vegas, May 28. Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty Images<br>If the British coined the term “too clever by half,” Vice President JD Vance might own the political update of “too smart by 99%.” And Donald Trump might wonder at what point he asks his veep: Please stop helping - at least when it comes to Mr. Trump’s greatest legacy and biggest asset, the U.S. Supreme Court.<br>Mr. Vance recently offered his own take on the “role” of that body, in particular Chief Justice John Roberts’s “profoundly wrong sentiment” that the judiciary exists to “check the excesses of the executive.” The vice president finger-wagged that this was “one-half” of the job; the “other half” was to stop a “small but substantial number” of courts from telling “the American people they’re not allowed to have what they voted for,” namely “immigration enforcement.” Also, to be “extremely deferential” to the “political judgment” made by “the people’s elected president of the United States.”<br>Mr. Vance did at least preface his comments with a warning that they may prove “inflammatory” - before inflaming away.<br>Students of law - or of, well, grade school - no doubt quickly picked up on the first problem. The foundation of the U.S. system is the constitutional separation of powers, checks and balances. Congress has the purse. The executive has the sword. The judiciary’s power is to settle “all Cases” and “Controversies” “arising” under the Constitution and other laws. Far from being “profoundly wrong,” Chief Justice Roberts’s sentiment was profoundly basic. To have a court that jumps to the will of a president or a changeable voting majority is to have... Venezuela. Mr. Vance, a Yale Law School graduate, surely would have disapproved of the court’s rubber-stamping Joe Biden’s student-loan forgiveness or vaccine mandates - even though Mr. Biden won an election.<br>Students of logic will find in the veep’s comments an impressive array of logical fallacies, from the straw man to the false dilemma. Chief Justice Roberts didn’t, as Mr. Vance suggests, claim “checking” was its main role, or single out the president. The chief uncontroversially noted that the role of the court was to “obviously decide cases, but in the course of that, check the excesses of Congress or the executive.”<br>Nor did he suggest lower courts were immune from checks. He probably didn’t feel it necessary, given that every opinion the high court issues is a review of something a lower court did. A significant number of its recent decisions have brushed back activist judges -allowing the administration to proceed, among other things, in removing independent agency heads, freezing grant money, and ending the temporary protected status program for Venezuelans. As for immigration, the court has continued to give the president the usual wide latitude - with the basic requirement of due process.<br>Which brings us to students of politics, who will recognize these comments as political malpractice. The most enduring legacy of the first Trump term was the cementing of a conservative Supreme Court majority that continues to thoughtfully transform the legal landscape. Religious freedom. The end of Roe v. Wade. The major-questions doctrine. The end of Chevron deference. Reining in the bureaucracy. Second Amendment rights. Presidential immunity.<br>And the question of what legacy emerges from Mr. Trump’s second term rests squarely in the hands of that same court. Mr. Trump is proving to be the most energetic executive in decades, challenging the establishment to rethink the status quo on everything from the federal workforce and government grant making to the power of independent agencies. Most of these questions are destined for the justices - the same people Mr. Vance and others in Mr. Trump’s orbit have taken to badgering.<br>Mr. Vance fashions himself shrewd and likely thinks his comments serve the multiple purposes of proving loyalty to his boss, whipping up the base, and (not-so) subtly warning the court of backlash if it fails to rule as he’d prefer. The vice president might consider that jurists are well-versed in the art of clever arguments; they know what he’s doing. Or that they aren’t easily intimidated - see the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. But they can get irritated and annoyed, and less motivated to do much beyond basic requirements. How helpful is that? And Mr. Vance might consider that his criticism is essentially a slap at the president’s judgment in appointing these justices and other lower-court judges (who occasionally rule against him) in the first place.<br>The temptation by Mr. Vance and other officials to let loose on the courts will grow as more issues ripen and the administration wins some and loses some (like this week’s tariff case). Mr. Trump has so far refrained from going full-frontal on the judiciary, a political instinct that has served him well, given the stakes. At some point, he might suggest that the vice president leave the politics to the guy actually in charge of the executive branch.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R141" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">142</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/30/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">SỰ THẬT Ê CHỀ VỀ JOE BIDEN, ĐẢNG DÂN CHỦ VÀ BÁO CHÍ MỸ<br>Hoa Kỳ đang bị chấn động vì cuốn “Original Sin” do Jake Tapper và Alex Thompson trình bày sự toa tập của chế độ Joe Biden nhằm che giấu sự thật về Biden.

(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)<br>The authors of the new book ‘Original Sin’ share all the details of how President Biden and his closest aides misled the American people.<br>(By Bari Weiss - The Free Press - 05.29.25 - Honestly with Bari Weiss)<br>In 2023 and 2024, there were many things that were unsayable. Perhaps the most unsayable - at least in legacy media circles - was this: The President of the United States was not capable of being president because he was no longer mentally fit.<br>Those people who did break the taboo - who dared to notice Biden’s countless gaffes and stiff gait, those who recognized the reality of old age - including special counsel Robert Hur - were written off or smeared. Videos of the president - clips of Biden tripping and misspeaking - were rebranded by The New York Times as “cheap fakes.” People were told to disbelieve their eyes and ears.<br>It’s now the spring of 2025. Donald Trump is the president. And now the unsayable things are being said - most dramatically in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s new book, Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.<br>Tapper, a CNN anchor, and Thompson, an Axios reporter, interviewed more than 200 people for this book, which illuminates Biden’s mental decline, his enablers, and how the country was effectively run by committee in the midst of his clear cognitive impairment.<br>For those of us who thought it was bad - it was actually so much worse than anyone could have imagined.<br>Alex and Jake have chosen to call the effort to hide Biden’s decline a “cover-up.” Those are choice words from two mainstream media insiders, invoking memories of Watergate and Iran-Contra. And the cover-up they are referring to, of course, is that of the Biden family and the close circle of advisers around them, many of whom are still delusional about Biden’s state.<br>But cover-up might be the term that many Americans would use to describe the press’s coverage of Biden. How did ordinary people see more than people with White House press passes? And what does this all say about human nature, transparency, and groupthink?<br>This is a really illuminating conversation about presidential power, the lengths some will go to keep it, and how the media failed to report the story of a lifetime.<br>You can listen to the full conversation below, watch the video recording, or scroll down to read an edited transcript.<br>On how Biden hid the truth about his deterioration:<br>Bari Weiss: For people that haven’t read Original Sin, tell us a little more about the crutches that allowed a nonfunctioning Biden to work.<br>Alex Thompson: All politicians prefer certain reporters at press conferences, and are usually directed to call on them. What started as an effort to make Biden look good grew more pronounced as he struggled. Every time Biden had a press conference, the White House press team handpicked the reporters. It became a crutch - they chose reporters who’d ask about topics he was comfortable with.<br>I covered the Biden White House for four years and never got a question. Once they picked you, the press team would cozy up and ask, “What are you interested in?” And sometimes reporters were just a bit too honest.<br>They filtered what the public saw by handpicking reporters. On the note cards - members of the cabinet told us there were scripts for cabinet meetings, not just when cameras were on, but even off-camera, before the meetings. This goes back to 2021. Aides, worried about him going off script, would go to cabinet secretaries and ask, “What do you want to ask?” or “If he asks this, what’s your answer?” One cabinet secretary literally described them as scripts. And sometimes the off-camera meetings were even weirder and more stilted.<br>BW: How so?<br>AT: Without cameras, they stuck to preselected answers. The White House would say cabinet meetings are always stilted, but even by that bar, they were odd, at times discursive, and troubling.<br>Jake Tapper: Just to pick up on that - these things evolve or devolve. In October 2023, they had their last cabinet meeting for almost a year. That’s shocking.<br>BW: How often are cabinet meetings typically held?<br>JT: Maybe four or five times a year. Depends on the president.<br>BW: And they’re usually sites of debate or passionate conversation about major issues?<br>JT: They should be. Not every presidency is like that, but if you’re the leader of the free world, it’s a key way to learn what’s going on in your administration. One-on-ones may be more productive, sure, but not having any meetings for a year is stunning.<br>AT: They were also shielding cabinet members from smaller meetings too. Several told us that.<br>JT: It started with teleprompters in the basement during the 2020 campaign. In 2021, it continued - understandable, we were still in Covid. But by 2023, he had teleprompters set up in the homes of donors for fundraisers. For meetings with 40 or 50 people.<br>Bari, if you were speaking to that size crowd - for The Free Press or a bar mitzvah - you’d speak for ten minutes. Anyone could. But the president couldn’t. And by 2023, this wasn’t the exception. It was the rule. People started getting alarmed - but privately.<br>On how Biden and his aides squashed internal dissent:<br>BW: Where were the voices around Biden - people like Jake Sullivan or Antony Blinken? People with integrity who understand the stakes of having a commander in chief who can’t function past 4 or 5 p.m.? What were they saying in 2022 and 2023?<br>AT: Two things. Even though the foreign policy team saw it, their view was distorted. If Biden got the right topic, he could clock back in. He was more engaged on foreign policy than other areas.<br>JT: Sometimes a lot more. Toward the end, when unrest in Syria and Assad’s fall happened, Biden was engaged. We’re not saying he was a vegetable. But he had really bad moments.<br>AT: Still, we talked to cabinet secretaries who didn’t believe he could handle a crisis that might unfold at 2 a.m.<br>BW: You quote a secretary saying, “If you expect the president to be woken up at 2 a.m., Biden was not capable of that in 2024.” Your reporting suggests he wasn’t capable of it in 2022 either.<br>AT: Definitely not in 2023. The secretary said 2024, but the signs were earlier.<br>BW: So how is no one internally saying, “This is not normal”? Where are those people?<br>AT: In Biden World, the defining virtue is loyalty. Dissent isn’t a conversation - it’s seen as disloyalty. Two things happened: People like pollster John Anzalone, who raised concerns, were sidelined. He raised questions about a real reelection process, and was told, “No, thanks.” He’s not part of the reelection.<br>That happened to many. Loyalty is enforced by Biden and Anthony Bernal, who was Jill Biden’s chief of staff. People got the memo: Don’t speak up or you’ll be pushed out.<br>Some things were done quietly - Bob Bauer, Biden’s longtime lawyer, had the Democratic National Committee get Hunter’s laptop, create a dossier of the worst details, and present it privately to Joe and Jill Biden. The message: This time, it’s all coming out. It will be painful.<br>JT: And that evidence would be introduced at trial.<br>AT: Exactly. But those were subtle gestures. No one, despite concerns about Biden’s ability to beat Trump or serve until 2029, got in his face.<br>On how Biden’s condition affected his decision-making:<br>BW: There were failures in Biden’s presidency - Afghanistan, the border, inflation. To what extent were those failures tied to his acuity?<br>JT: In June 2024, Senator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, goes to the White House for an immigration event. Biden glitches - not just forgetting Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas’s name, but something deeper.<br>Bennet leaves thinking, “This is why our immigration policy is such a mess - he can’t manage the competing interests.” Mayorkas expected a 2021 order to secure the border. Obama deported many - he was called “deporter-in-chief.” But that crackdown never came. Bennet thought Biden simply couldn’t handle it.<br>When it comes to the American Rescue Plan, Biden’s big 2021 spending bill, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned it would be inflationary. We don’t know how much of that Biden was briefed on. His team wasn’t just hiding him from the world - they were hiding the world from him. Poll numbers, information - it was unhealthy. So yes, quite a bit was tied to his acuity. And we’re still reporting for the paperback.<br>On the role of Hunter Biden:<br>JT: I don’t have high regard for Hunter based on his role here. It’s tragic. His addiction and chaos caused a lot of his father’s decline. The plea deal falling apart in summer 2023, then the trial and conviction in 2024 - those were moments of real deterioration for Biden.<br>It’s not just fear of Hunter going to jail - it’s fear of relapse or suicide. Biden already lost his wife and daughter in 1972, his son Beau in 2015. Losing his last child? He couldn’t recover from that.<br>Hunter, meanwhile, saw this as a chance for redemption - standing up for his dad, pushing him to run again, fighting back against Special Counsel Robert Hur and anyone trying to push him out.<br>At one point, Hunter talked about running for mayor of Wilmington. He wanted to show he had what Beau and his dad had. But in pushing Biden to run again, he couldn’t see what was happening.<br>The best advice - obvious in hindsight - was to take the legacy of one term and let a new generation of Democrats step forward. But he pushed his dad to stay. In 2023 and 2024, he wanted the White House to be the Hunter Biden defense organization. They said no. He and his allies were sidelined.<br>After the poor debate performance, the family blamed senior communications adviser Anita Dunn. She left the White House and joined the super PAC. There’s a price for crossing the Bidens - excommunication. Even loyal aides like Dunn and Bauer lost that battle with Hunter.<br>On what made Biden drop out:<br>BW: Given the drama, the three weeks after the debate feel anticlimactic. In the book, Schumer paints himself as the hero who finally speaks truth to power. But where was he before?<br>JT: He’s the only one we found who told the president not to run. Not Obama, Pelosi, Jeffries, Katzenberg - only Schumer.<br>BW: And that’s what made Biden finally decide?<br>AT: It was a combination. He didn’t want to divide the party. Maybe he could win the nomination, but it would be ugly. Then he caught Covid, was isolated in Rehoboth.<br>JT: And it really sucked. If you’re 81 and have Covid, it’s serious.<br>AT: Schumer being blunt - saying the majority of senators didn’t think he should run - meant something to Biden. He spent 36 years in the Senate. Other operatives made the case there was another path, that he couldn’t win anymore. I also think there may be more we don’t know yet. This is the first draft, not the last.<br>JT: We’ll add more in the paperback. He was so —<br>AT: So defunct. He still thinks he could’ve won. He believed it was winnable. And if you think Trump is a threat, why drop out? Was it just Covid?<br>BW: Or was it that he has metastatic prostate cancer?<br>AT: I wasn’t speculating that, but—<br>BW: Because that’s the perfect transition. Right before your book drops, they announce he has stage four prostate cancer. And people like Dr. Zeke Emanuel - hardly Biden critics - say there’s no way it was a recent diagnosis. He’s probably had it for 5–10 years. Did they lie?<br>JT: We don’t have reporting that contradicts their version: diagnosed Friday, announced Sunday.<br>BW: Right before the book drops.<br>JT: People are skeptical - we get that. Even people in the Biden White House are skeptical. But we don’t have the reporting.<br>What it underscores is how opaque this all is. These are the most sensitive, personal subjects. We believe presidents should disclose everything - every medication, every test result. But that’s not how it works. There’s sympathy for leaders on health. We’re on the honor system. Is it possible he hasn’t had a PSA test since 2014? Maybe. But that’s the blood test relevant to the prostate, and for someone running the country - not the average 70-year-old - you’d think they’d want to know.<br>Jake Tapper’s response to online criticism:<br>BW: The backlash that I’m seeing is largely coming from X. I don’t go on Bluesky. I’m sure it’s happening there too.<br>JT: I had to get off on October 8, 2023, for obvious reasons.<br>BW: Right, so a lot of what I’m seeing, Jake, is not directed at Alex, who has been reporting on this.<br>JT: I’m seeing some nasty stuff about Alex. I’ll share it with you later.<br>BW: I would say it’s largely focused on you, perhaps because you have a huge show on CNN every night, perhaps because they’ve read Alex’s wonderful reporting in Axios - who knows. But it’s more focused on you and there are some specific clips that are getting circulated a lot, specifically one where Lara Trump is on your show.<br>JT: It was October 2020, it was four and a half years ago.<br>BW: She basically suggests what the reporting in this book suggests - that she’s looking at an enfeebled president who’s not fully compos mentis. And you sort of glibly dismiss her. And I wondered if you could reflect on that a little bit. I know you called her, but when you’re watching that clip, what version of yourself do you see?<br>JT: I don’t want to make excuses for it. We live on TV and so we die on TV. Things that we say age well or age poorly - and that one aged poorly.<br>I see somebody who is interviewing a member of the Trump family right before an election, and I think that Joe Biden is old, but I do not have any reports suggesting that he is in cognitive decline. I know that I have been shocked by the things that members of the Trump family are saying about President Biden - then Vice President Biden. Don Jr. is out there literally suggesting he’s a pedophile on Instagram and such. I didn’t think much of what she was saying, but she was right and I was wrong.<br>I think that there is a big, big difference between the Joe Biden of 2020 and the Joe Biden of 2024, as our reporting bears out. And there’s also a big, big difference between what I am saying now - having reported this book - and the information she had. Although again, our reporting suggests that there were moments of cognitive impairment that he was having as far back as 2015.<br>I would also say, in terms of my reflection on this, just in the last couple weeks, some of those clips that you mentioned - the Lara Trump one is totally fair. That’s fine. It’s accurate. I said it. I did it. I own it.<br>But some of the clips are deceptively edited. I’m not going to call them “cheap fakes,” but they are me saying what The Washington Post is accusing somebody of doing, and they edit out me citing The Washington Post. Or it’s me interviewing Franklin Foer about his book on Biden and making it sound as though I am saying what I am paraphrasing Franklin Foer saying. And on and on. Whatever - this is the world that we’re in.<br>But when the publicists for the book went to The Wall Street Journal editorial page or Fox News - when I reached out to a Republican senator - who all used these clips without even researching them or anything like that and said “These are out of context,” they were not greeted with the response of, “Oh, I’m so sorry, I’ll correct the record,” or “That’s not true,” or “Let me see what the reality is.” What was the response? They don’t care. They ignore it. It doesn’t matter. Moving on.<br>I’m okay reflecting and looking back and saying, “I wish I’d done this better.” I wish I had been more aggressive. What Lara Trump said turned out to be accurate based on my reporting. And here is our book showing this reporting. And I think this book is important. The reason why this book is getting attention is because airing those clips and making fun of President Biden is not actually reporting. It’s commentary - and it’s fine, and I’m not criticizing it - but what we do in this book is actually show what was going on behind the scenes.<br>But I’m fine being the person that reflects and says, “You know, I got that wrong,” or “I could have done that better,” in contrast to these critics who, in the name of media criticism, are being untruthful and don’t care.<br>BW: But would you say that, looking back at the body of your work during the Biden White House, you could have brought a level of skepticism, scrutiny, and curiosity to this story?<br>JT: Of course. There are very few members of the legacy media that I don’t think could say that. But I will say that in October 2020, I interviewed Joe Biden, and I asked if he would take a pledge to be transparent about his health. And in October 2022, the only time I had an interview with him during his presidency, I pointed out that the American people think he’s too old. Whenever he’s asked about that, he says, “Watch me.” They’re watching him. They still think that.<br>I had skeptical interviews with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in 2023. And I was not a Robert Hur basher. I completely thought that he was accurate. And I didn’t understand what I was seeing from the White House or from other journalists that didn’t see what we were all seeing.<br>So I think that there is reporting that I’m proud of that is also part of the record. But on the whole, I wish these 200 sources had talked to us two years ago. And I wish I’d known what I know now. I would not say I was incurious. I would say that I was one of the many people who was asking about this and was lied to - over and over.<br>You have to remember, the Biden people were not only lying to the press and to the public - they were lying to donors, cabinet secretaries, Democratic members of Congress. A cover-up, and almost a successful one. Even though we all saw him aging, we didn’t know he had these moments of nonfunctioning. It suggests that there’s a lot of people in on something. And whether they were doing it because they believed it or they had been told it, at the end of the day, the Democrats did this. At the end of the day, the Biden family and the politburo - his senior aides - did this.<br>And yes, there were those of us who should have pushed back more. But if you can’t get officials to tell you it’s really bad behind the scenes - let me tell you how bad it is - I don’t know what more we could have done. And I wish that those people had been more willing to talk to the press.<br>On continued Democratic reluctance to blame Biden:<br>JT: I think that one of the things that’s been surprising is that I would think that there would be a Democratic presidential candidate in 2029 or whatever who would come out and say something along the lines of: “We have to be honest with the American people. We can’t let that happen again.”<br>And you have seen glimmers of it from Rep. Ro Khanna, Senator Chris Murphy. Pete Buttigieg said something about how it was obvious that Biden shouldn’t have run again. People just dipping their toe in it.<br>I think that there are a lot of Democrats who still don’t want to talk about this and still don’t want to confront the fact that Joe Biden and his team were part of a cover-up and a deception campaign that ended up delivering Donald Trump back to the White House.<br>They just don’t want to accept it. They want to blame me, or New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, or Trump, or Fox, or whatever. But there’s no degree among the Democratic base to reckon with what they are part of.<br>Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for clarity.

A federal appeals court on Thursday allowed his duties to stay in effect while the administration’s appeal moves forward, but U.S. officials are weighing their options should they need to find a new legal authority to impose the president’s steep tariffs, which he argues will help rebalance trade in America’s favor.<br>The potential pivot reflects the challenges to Trump’s aggressive trade policy, which relied on a novel interpretation of trade law. Typically, tariffs are imposed using targeted authority delegated to the president by Congress, but Trump’s team relied on little-used emergency powers to impose the bulk of his wide-ranging second-term tariffs quickly.<br>With that strategy under threat, the president’s team is weighing a twofold response, according to people familiar with the matter.<br>First, the administration is considering a stopgap effort to impose tariffs on swaths of the global economy under a never-before-used provision of the Trade Act of 1974, which includes language allowing for tariffs of up to 15% for 150 days to address trade imbalances with other countries, the people said. That would then buy time for Trump to devise individualized tariffs for each major trading partner under a different provision of the same law, used to counter unfair foreign trade practices.<br>That second step requires a lengthy notification and comment process, but is seen by administration officials as more legally defensible than the tariff policy that was found to be illegal this week. The alternative provision has been used many times in the past, including for Trump’s first-term tariffs on China.<br>Peter Navarro speaking outside the White House.<br>Peter Navarro, senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, is floating alternative strategies. Photo: Nathan Howard/Reuters<br>The conversations remained fluid, and the administration hadn’t made a final decision, the people added. The administration could wait to implement any alternative plans after the federal appeals court allowed Trump’s emergency tariffs to stay in place during the appeals process.<br>The White House and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative didn’t respond to requests for comment. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that the administration is weighing other options to impose tariffs as it appeals the court rulings, but she didn’t give specifics.<br>Peter Navarro, senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, appeared to confirm that the administration is considering a twofold alternative tariff plan, which would first use Section 122 of the 1974 trade law, and then Section 301. <br>“Those are the kinds of thoughts” the economic team is considering, he said when asked about those provisions on Bloomberg TV. Navarro also suggested that the administration could use the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which has a provision that allows for tariffs on nations that discriminate against America. The U.S. could also expand the use of tariffs imposed citing national-security concerns.<br>All of the options under consideration now were discussed in the early weeks of the administration, but officials opted to instead impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, also known as IEEPA. The law had never been used before to impose tariffs but allowed the administration to move quickly to impose levies on virtually every global trading partner.<br>In its decision Wednesday, the U.S. Court of International Trade struck down Trump’s use of IEEPA to address trade deficits. In doing so, the court pointed to Section 122, the measure Trump’s team is now weighing as a stopgap policy, saying part of federal law already grants explicit authority to address “large and serious balance-of-payments deficits.”<br>WSJ explains how markets reacted after a federal trade court struck down President Trump’s tariffs and the implications for international trade. Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images<br>Pivoting to a different tariff authority could pose risks. If the administration moves to use a different law, that could be seen by courts as admitting defeat in ongoing appeals in the IEEPA case.<br>“The administration could quickly turn to other tariff authorities, but doing so while the ruling is under judicial review could be seen as a lack of confidence in the final decision,” said Everett Eissenstat, who served as deputy director of the National Economic Council in Trump’s first term.<br>Trump’s alternative plan would likely still face legal challenges, said Peter Harrell, who served as senior director for international economics on the Biden administration’s National Security Council. But both elements are on firmer legal ground than the IEEPA tariffs, he said.<br>The Court of International Trade “seemed to indicate that Section 122 is how you’d address a trade deficit,” Harrell said. Section 301, he added, has a long case law history, and action under that provision would likely be upheld as long as the Trump administration can point to unfair trade practices from each targeted nation. In all, the plan is “certainly more defensible than the IEEPA tariffs,” he said.<br>Trump’s potential alternative tariff plan has an advantage: Using another law to reimpose the tariffs could smooth over any interruptions in tariffs because of the court’s ruling, preserving Trump’s leverage in ongoing trade talks. In a filing asking for an emergency stay on the Court of International Trade’s decision, the administration said the ruling “jeopardizes ongoing negotiations with dozens of countries by severely constraining the President’s leverage and undermining the premise of ongoing negotiations.”<br>That appeared to contradict National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who insisted Thursday that trade negotiations will continue unabated and that three deals are close to being completed. Navarro similarly said that “nothing has really changed.”<br>The ruling on Wednesday came days after the president threatened to impose 50% tariffs on the European Union and then quickly pulled back to allow for negotiations until July 9 - a deadline now thrown into question.<br>A rise in global stocks supports the EU’s argument that tariffs aren’t good for anyone, Spanish Minister of Economy Carlos Cuerpo said Thursday. He said the bloc is taking “a constructive approach to reaching an agreement and, if possible, even reducing barriers” below pretariff dispute levels.<br>Some analysts said the ruling could ease the path for a trade deal between the U.S. and EU by removing, if the decision survives Trump’s appeal, a key sticking point from the negotiations.<br>Ignacio García Bercero, a former EU trade official, said that removing the U.S.’s 10% tariff on European imports and the threat of further across-the-board tariffs would allow trade negotiators to focus instead on the U.S.’s sectoral tariffs on such industries as steel and automobiles. Those were implemented on national-security grounds, not using the economic-powers law, and will be unaffected by the continuing court battle. <br>“If there’s a more pragmatic attitude from the United States and also, of course, from the European Union, one would have the opportunity to try to use this to find a more balanced type of agreement that is in the interest of both sides,” he said.<br>Write to Gavin Bade at gavin.bade@wsj.com and Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R143" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">144</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/30/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">NGA PHẠM TỘI ÁC TRONG CHIẾN TRANH<br>Bản tin của RFE/RL cho biết cơ quan Liên Hiệp Quốc đã điều tra và lên án quân Nga là cố tình bắn hạ xe cứu thương tại Ukraine…<br>https://www.rferl.org/.../ukraine-russia.../33428429.html<br>Russian Drone Attacks In Ukraine&#39;s Kherson Amount To War Crimes, Says UN<br>(By RFE/RL - May 29, 2025 09:55 CET)<br>The UN report alleges that Russian soldiers deliberately targeted ambulances with drones.<br>Russia&#39;s military has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in its drone attacks on civilian targets in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, a new United Nations report has found.<br>The report by Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, issued on May 28, was the latest evidence pointing to possible crimes allegedly committed by Russian civilian or military authorities in Ukraine.<br>&quot;Russian armed forces have committed the crimes against humanity of murder and the war crimes of attacking civilians, through a months-long pattern of drone attacks targeting civilians on the right bank of the Dnieper River in Kherson Province,&quot; the commission report said.<br>Ukrainian investigators have compiled evidence on what they say are tens of thousands of potential war crimes, allegedly committed by Russian troops.

America should not be in the business of financing an enemy.<br>Despite these clear warnings, the People’s Republic of China, with help from the Biden administration, Democratic governors, and members of Congress, has established footholds in America’s emerging electric vehicle battery sector.<br>Gotion, a company with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party, has begun building plants in Michigan and Illinois despite strong local pushback. Last year, President Trump wrote on Truth Social that the Gotion plants “would put Michiganders under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing.”<br>CATL, a company designated by the Pentagon as a “Chinese Military Company,” is working with Ford in Michigan and also has footprints in several other states. Secretary of State and acting National Security Advisor Marco Rubio previously sought to block CATL’s Michigan plant, writing that the facility will “only deepen U.S. reliance on the Chinese Communist Party for battery tech.” He also highlighted the company’s “ties to forced labor and to Xinjiang” and urged the Department of Homeland Security to add CATL to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Entity List, which would blacklist its products in the United States.<br>President Trump and Secretary Rubio are right - but even with Republicans in control of Washington, these malicious actors continue to operate in the U.S. Now, the new reconciliation bill, deemed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” just passed in the House - and it fails to fix loopholes created by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As this legislation moves to the Senate, it leaves the window open for Chinese companies to benefit from massive U.S. tax credits, specifically the 45x Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, an uncapped incentive program for certain manufacturing projects.<br>Unless the Senate takes action to fix this legislation, the American taxpayer will be on the hook for funding our foremost adversary. While Chinese companies cannot receive tax credits on their own, they can easily bypass these restrictions by establishing joint ventures or taking advantage of projects that license Chinese technology to receive tax credits for at least two more years.<br>Right now, the highest-profile project that would benefit from these credits is Ford’s BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, which relies on CATL’s battery technology. Under this arrangement, Ford will pay CATL to license its technology and operational services for the plant.<br>Under the House-passed bill, U.S. companies that receive “material assistance” from prohibited foreign entities like CATL will remain eligible to receive 45X tax credits for at least two years. Ford has yet to disclose the details of this arrangement, despite threats of Congressional subpoena, so the American people still have no idea of how much of their dollars will flow to Beijing.<br>Ford has committed itself to this project - despite the clear economic and national security threats. Ford ignores the U.S. Department of Defense, which has already outlawed battery procurement from CATL, Gotion, and four other Chinese companies.<br>So, will the Senate protect America? Will the Senate stop China’s malicious efforts to dominate America’s critical technologies?<br>As a first step, the Senate must mandate no U.S. tax credits to any PRC-affiliated companies. None. Moving further, they should stop PRC companies from further infiltrating America’s industrial base and block U.S. companies from working domestically with any company listed by the Department of Defense as a Chinese Military Company or that is considered a foreign entity of concern.<br>Since entering public life, President Trump has elevated the threat that China poses to the United States. He has changed the paradigm of how Americans think about the Chinese regime. In this new White House term, he can use all tools of American power to confront this Chinese threat and ensure America’s prosperity and security far into the future.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R145" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">146</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/30/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỘT TIN RẤT LẠ, TA CẦN BIẾT THÊM:<br>Một loại thuốc thử máu cho trẻ sơ sinh có thể lập tức phát giác mấy ngàn bệnh di truyền trong cơ thể, kể cả loại bệnh hiếm hoi và khó trị.

But that paradigm could be about to change, the study’s lead author says.<br>Daniella Hock, a senior postdoctoral researcher at the University of Melbourne, told UPI that if the test is implemented in clinical labs, “it can potentially replace multiple functional tests. This can potentially reduce the diagnostic time for patients and families and healthcare costs.<br>“The test only requires only 1 milliliter of blood from infants, and results can be achieved in less than three days for urgent cases,” she said.<br>One area in which the new proteomics test could have immediate benefits is in the battle against mitochondrial diseases, which are defined by the Cleveland Clinic as a group of genetic conditions that affect how mitochondria in human cells produce energy. Mitochondrial diseases render cells unable to produce enough energy, which can lead to life-threatening complications.<br>About 1 in 5,000 people worldwide have a mitochondrial disorder. Examples of such illnesses are Leigh’s syndrome, which primarily affects the nervous system; Kearns-Sayre syndrome, which primarily affects the eyes and heart; and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, which can cause a sufferer to quickly and unexpectedly lose their vision.<br>Hock said the current “gold standard” for screening for these rare maladies starts with genetic testing - either whole exome or whole genome sequencing - that currently provides a diagnosis to about half of patients.<br>“The remaining half often endure years of functional testing trying to identify which genetic change, that is, genetic variant, is causing the disease,” she said, adding that more than 7,000 types of disease caused by mutations exist in more than 5,000 known genes.<br>Some of these current tests are invasive, requiring skeletal muscle or liver biopsies, and are often targeted to a single disease or a few diseases.<br>    “If we take the example of mitochondrial disease, which is a type of rare disease that can be caused by over 350 different genes, the current clinical test to confirm mitochondrial disease is called respiratory chain enzymology. This enzyme test typically requires a skeletal muscle or skin biopsy and has a turnaround time of a few weeks.”<br>The new proteomic test, which sequences proteins rather than genes, can reduce invasiveness and time to a diagnosis compared to other kinds of current clinical functional tests.<br>    “For about half of the individuals where DNA sequencing results are inconclusive, typically due to the identification of variants of uncertain significance, this single test can potentially be used to provide functional evidence to these genetic variants.”<br>Study co-author David Thorburn, one of Australia’s foremost experts on genetics and co-group leader for brain and mitochondrial research at Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne, said the current process for determining if a child has one of the many possible genetic variances is a daunting one.<br>While there are many hundreds of different functional tests tailored to specific genes, “relatively few of these are available in clinical labs, so it is often a matter of contacting researchers who work on that gene, of which there may only be one or a handful internationally to see if they can assist,” he told UPI in emailed comments.<br>    “That often requires paperwork like material transfer agreements to be put in place, shipping costs of hundreds or even thousands of dollars if dry ice shipment is needed and frequently a timeframe of months to multiple years depending on whether they have a student or staff to do testing in a research context, where the rigor of the test may be variable,”<br>Thorburn said the new proteomics test, however, “provides a single pipeline that can potentially provide that evidence for about half the known rare disease genes and we are working hard to move it into a clinical test in Melbourne at our Victorian Clinical Genetics Services and working with expert clinical labs in the U.K., U.S.A. and elsewhere to support them doing that.”<br>Having the test available clinically “could allow hundreds of families each year in Australia alone to get confirmed genetic diagnoses, so potentially thousands per year in the U.S.,” he said. “For urgent cases, (for example, kids in ICU) this can be done in as few as three days from sample receipt.”<br>For those many thousands of patients, the new test could mean their “diagnostic odyssey is ended, unnecessary investigations are no longer needed, targeted therapies may be available, patients may qualify for a clinical trial and parents can be offered reproductive options,” he said.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R146" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">147</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/30/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỘT BÀI QUAN ĐIỂM TUYỆT VỜI:<br>Hội đồng Biên tập The Spectator (tạp chí Anh quốc) viết bài quan điểm về công chi thu của kinh tế Hoa Kỳ.

Yet the opposite is true<br>(By Spectator Editorial - Thursday, May 29, 2025)<br>Donald Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill was supposed to slash government waste and inefficiency. So why is it going to result in an even bigger, uglier deficit? The legislation was still being picked over in the Senate as this magazine went to press. But the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has calculated that the bill will add $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next decade – and that estimate is far more likely to go up than down.<br>The President’s opponents have characterized the Big, Beautiful Bill as a swindle that steals from the poor to give to the rich. That may be true to some extent, in that it could become harder for some people to qualify for Medicaid, while wealthy Americans will enjoy the extension of lower tax rates.<br>Then again, there are tax breaks for the low-paid, too, in the removal of taxes on tips and overtime as well as a suspension of tax on car loans. The problem with the Democrats’ reverse Robin Hood narrative is that it misses the bigger point: the federal government is risking impoverishing everyone by failing to get spending under control. Maybe that’s what progressives really mean when they talk about “equity.”<br>“Did my best,” wrote Elon Musk, dejectedly, on his social media platform X, in response to a fan who expressed horror at the Republican party’s reluctance to support his Department for Government Efficiency (DoGE). Two days later, Musk publicly confirmed that his time as “special employee” in the White House was over. In the same week, he expressed his “disappointment” over the Big, Beautiful Bill. “I think a bill can be big or beautiful,” he said. “I don’t know if it can be both.” Trump’s supporters will say that such talk shows that Musk is just a Ron DeSantis-like fiscal hawk who doesn’t appreciate the new winds of economic populism. But the logic of spending within one’s means is irrefutable.<br>DoGE was supposed to signal a huge change in how the government spends money. President Trump invited Musk to rifle through the government’s accounts and slash just about everything. And yet Musk was unable to stop the government racking up ever-higher debts to be borne by future generations of taxpayers.<br>There are certainly substantial cuts to some services in the bill. There are also substantial rises, however, such as an extra $67 billion over ten years for homeland security and an extra $144 billion of military spending. Trump’s supporters will say that voters want strong borders and a powerful military – and that’s true. But bills have to be paid somehow. The Trump administration also wants to introduce $4.8 trillion worth of tax cuts, again over the next decade. Cutting that much revenue out of the system makes it extremely difficult to balance the books, even with healthy economic growth. Trump’s “External Revenue Service” – i.e., his tariffs – may for now be bringing in billions of dollars. But tariffs will not plug the yawning hole in the nation’s finances.<br>With Musk now stepping back from government, the momentum for spending cuts appears to have been lost. DoGE was good politics. The public enjoys seeing the fiscal fat in Washington exposed and removed. But it was always going to be difficult for the world’s richest man, a South African by birth, to get away with imposing austerity on everyday Americans. And with federal entitlements as vast as they are, tackling the debt in earnest must involve making difficult and unpopular decisions. That’s not something Donald Trump, with his political eye fixed firmly on the midterms, seems willing to do.<br>The President’s political ideology may seem to be the polar opposite of European governments. Yet the pattern across the developed world is the same: governments run vast deficits not just through the bad times, as John Maynard Keynes might have advised, but through the good times, too. And when the bad times return, they want to borrow even more, which takes us all closer to fiscal oblivion. Governments end up in this position for a very simple reason: it is politically far easier to spend money than it is to raise it through taxes. As a consequence, successive administrations have been drawn to do more of the former than the latter. In the short term, that can bring rewards on election day. In the long term, politicians have to hope that they are not the ones in power when the reckoning comes.<br>The growing indebtedness of first-world governments is one of those things that carries on apace because no one wants to admit the obvious dangers. If a government finds it does not have the money to service its debts – which, in the federal government’s case cost $881 billion last year, more than the $850 billion spent on defense – holders of Treasury bills can comfort themselves with the thought that a sovereign government can always print its way out of trouble. A government, especially in America, can print all the money it likes, but that doesn’t mean this money will have much in the way of value. The biggest hazard from excessive government indebtedness is that it drives up inflation – the mechanism that ensures we cannot get something for nothing.<br>Modern governments like to imagine their spending helps to boost growth, thereby easing the debt burden. Yet the opposite is true: by transferring resources from the private to the public sector they suppress growth. The creation of DoGE promised to mark a once-in-a-generation change of attitude toward government spending. But even though there will be deep cuts in some areas, the will to create lasting change has always been missing. If Trump and Musk cannot rein in spending, it is hard to imagine who will ever balance the books.<br>This article was originally published in The Spectator’s July 2025 World edition.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R147" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">148</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/29/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Chuyện Thương Chiến! <br>Một tòa Kháng án Liên bang tạm hủy bỏ án lệnh ngày hôm qua về thương chiến, nên sẽ tiếp tục thi hành quyết định của Trump, cho đến khi có quyết định khác!<br>Bản tin nóng của The Epoch Times:<br>https://www.theepochtimes.com/.../trumps-tariffs...<br>US - US Politics<br>Trump’s Tariffs Temporarily Reinstated by Appeals Court, Reversing Lower Court Order<br>The ruling is a reversal of a lower court order a day earlier.<br>Trump’s Tariffs Temporarily Reinstated by Appeals Court, Reversing Lower Court Order<br>President Donald Trump holds a chart as he delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs during an event in the Rose Garden entitled &quot;Make America Wealthy Again&quot; at the White House in Washington on April 2, 2025.

As one of them, Sarah Milgrim, a 26-year-old Jew from Kansas, tried to crawl away, the gunman continued shooting at her.<br>“Free, free Palestine,” he shouted as police took him into custody.<br>You would think that this would be easy to condemn. Yet when the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America said in a statement released last Thursday that they “reject the violence of last night’s fatal shooting,” some members of the political organization revolted.<br>Almost immediately, a debate broke out in the national DSA’s internal message board for dues-paying members over how to respond to the killings outside the Capital Jewish Museum.<br>“Is it good to condemn violence against a genocidal apartheid state?” a DSA member with the username “SebastianFG” said in a post. Other members responded to the post with emojis of a heart and applause.<br>Other DSA members called the statement “horrific,” “hurtful,” and “irresponsible.”<br>[Chi tiết quan trọng:]<br>The Democratic Socialists of America is not just a fringe activist organization. Its national membership has skyrocketed in recent years to more than 90,000, riding the wave of Bernie Sanders’s nearly successful primary challenge of Hillary Clinton in 2016. The political organization has since boasted major electoral success with politicians in Congress’s progressive “Squad,” including Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib and New York City’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The far-left group unendorsed Ocasio-Cortez last year after the congresswoman voted in favor of a resolution affirming Israel’s “right to exist.”<br>The radical group is deeply fractured over how to respond to last week’s killings of Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky. (The alleged shooter, Elias Rodriguez, was charged with murder of foreign officials, first-degree murder, and other crimes.)<br>On one side of the fight within the DSA is the group’s so-called “right wing,” as its critics call it, which believes that the DSA should avoid any association with violence - and either condemn the act or not speak of it at all. This camp includes members who described themselves as a 69-year-old “radical,” a union member from Virginia, and a travel writer based in Louisiana, according to messages reviewed by The Free Press.<br>Then there are the DSA extremists, some of whom argue violence is necessary for revolution and others who openly celebrate it.<br>“Where is our commitment to non-violent resistance stated?” a DSA member from Seattle with the username “ChrisW” wanted to know. “It’s not in the constitution or bylaws, the closest thing is that we reject ‘brutality and violence in defense of the status quo.’ ”<br>A DSA member from northern New Jersey with the username “Conordachisen” wrote that “non violent, peaceful action” isn’t the only way to achieve socialism - “there’ll also be comrades who understand that violent revolution is a thing, too.”<br>This faction of the DSA is best represented by the Liberation Caucus, which describes itself as “a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist caucus in DSA.” On Wednesday, the Liberation Caucus posted on X that it was “proud” to sign onto a statement calling the recent shooting “a legitimate act of resistance against the zionist state.”<br>“Free Elias Rodriguez and all political prisoners,” the Liberation Caucus said in a post.<br>A flyer displays a photo of Yaron Lischinsky, who was murdered outside of an event at a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C. (via @UnityOfFields/X)<br>That statement was written by the militant group Unity of Fields, which then-Senator Marco Rubio called upon the Department of Justice to investigate for “domestic terrorism” last October. Unity of Fields members include James “Fergie” Chambers, an heir to the Cox Enterprises media fortune.<br>“To be clear, what we are asserting is more than a recognition that the violence and oppression meted out by the zionist movement will inevitably give rise to counter-violence, an indisputable truism,” the group wrote Monday on X. “We are saying that such counter-violence is legitimate. It is justice.”<br>The statement fueled even more infighting among DSA members and is now causing waves in the New York City mayoral race, especially for some top contenders who are facing a dilemma over how to respond. In particular, the pressure is on Zohran Mamdani, a New York state assemblyman and prominent member of the Democratic Socialists of America whose campaign flyers say he is “proudly endorsed” by the group’s New York City chapter, to either condemn the Unity of Field’s statement or endorse it.<br>After last week’s killings, Mamdani said he was “horrified” by the “appalling rise in antisemitic violence.” Last night, Unity of Fields publicly prodded Mamdani to go in the opposite direction. “As a DSA mayoral candidate and self-professed supporter of Palestinian liberation, @ZohranKMamdani must commend the DSA Liberation Caucus for upholding Elias Rodriguez’s righteous action, which is the most anyone in this country has done for Palestine,” Unity of Fields wrote in a post on X. Mamdani and DSA representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment from The Free Press.<br>Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor, is leading the mayoral race so far, and Mamdani is in second place, but he has been gaining ground in recent polls. Cuomo, who recently marched in the city’s Israel Day Parade, denounced the Unity of Field’s statement. He wrote that his opponents “are either members of the Democratic Socialists of America or are supported by/have supported DSA members.”<br>“I call on them to denounce this inflammatory position which is abhorrent to the Jewish community and all law abiding Americans,” he wrote Wednesday.<br>Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller who is polling in third place in the mayoral race, called himself a “Brooklyn Jewish Democratic Socialist” in 2016. He didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br>A dozen other far-left groups have signed onto the Unity of Field’s statement, including Masar Badil, a group linked to Samidoun, a promoter of anti-Israeli sentiment on college campuses. The group’s leader has been sanctioned by the U.S. for his “fundraising and recruitment efforts” that “support the PFLP’s terrorist activity against Israel.” The Unity of Field’s statement, which also expressed support for Iran, called for supporters to “rally to defend Elias Rodriguez” and even donate funds to his jail commissary account.<br>On Wednesday, Unity of Fields called the Liberation Caucus “the most principled DSA members in the country” but Unity of Fields is no fan of the national chapter. On Wednesday, Unity of Fields accused the DSA’s national leadership of promoting “liberal zionism and traitorous collaborationism with the ruling class.”<br>On the national DSA’s internal message board, some members expressed concern about the public endorsement of violence. “It is going to be read as an endorsement of indiscriminate murder,” wrote “Wbreeves2002,” the 69-year-old self-described “radical,” in the online discussion. “By signing on to this, the so-called ‘Liberation’ caucus has put every member of DSA and the organization itself at risk.”<br>The national Democratic Socialists of America had urged local chapters to stay quiet about the internal controversy, according to posts on the internal message board. Last night, though, the DSA broke its own silence. “Democratic Socialists of America seek to democratically transform our society and reject vigilante violence,” the group wrote on X after the Liberation Caucus’s post went viral. “We condemn the murder of Israeli embassy workers.”<br>The statement also tried to separate the national chapter from the Liberation Caucus, saying that “any statement otherwise is not the stance of DSA.”<br>In an apparent response to the blowback about its earlier comments, the Liberation Caucus tweeted Wednesday night that “we are just one” of “many different ideological tendencies” within the Democratic Socialists of America.<br>“Right wing news outlets and individuals have chosen to take the statement we signed to portray the entire organization as holding our views - this is wrong,” the Liberation Caucus posted.<br>Some DSA members who described themselves as members of the Liberation Caucus aren’t backing down. “Signing a statement in support of a political prisoner is not wrong,” a DSA member from St. Louis with the username “Blackredguard” wrote on the DSA’s message board, “and I frankly don’t think we have anything to apologize for.”<br>“You wonder why people call DSA a bunch of useless liberals scared of their own shadow,” he continued. “This is why.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R150" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">151</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/29/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">JONATHAN TURLEY NHẬN XÉT VỀ LUẬT THƯƠNG CHIẾN<br>Bài viết chừng mực của giáo sư Jonathan Turley giúp chúng ta hiểu ra nhiều khúc mắc về luật lệ khiến ban tham mưu của Trump học thêm kinh nghiệm ứng phó cho chính xác hơn.<br>https://jonathanturley.org/.../liberation-day-meets.../<br>Dusk Comes to Liberation Day: Court Strikes Down Trump Tariffs in the Midst of Trade Negotiations<br>(Jonathan Turley - Columns, Congress, Constitutional Law, Politics - May 29, 2025)<br>Below is my column in the New York Post on the decision yesterday finding that the Trump tariffs are invalid. What happens now will be, if nothing else, interesting. Dusk has come to Liberation Day. Trump has options, but the pressure will now be greater on Congress as bilateral trade agreements are moving forward.<br>Here is the column:<br>On Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” collided with deliberation day in the courts, and it did not go well. The Court of International Trade ruled that the President lacks the authority to impose his massive tariffs worldwide.<br>But all is not lost for Trump’s tariffs.<br>The three-judge panel held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) does not give the president “such unbounded authority.”<br>While some have criticized the court as a “judicial coup,” it is a well-reasoned and good-faith decision from judges appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama, and Trump.<br>While the court, in my view, should have issued a stay pending appeal, a wide array of experts have questioned the authority under the IEEPA, which is designed to address a national emergency. The authority does not mention tariffs and has never been used for tariffs. There’s a good chance the Supreme Court upholds the ruling.<br>The Trump administration is now appealing and pushing for a stay to prevent this ruling from having a disruptive impact on the nearly completed array of trade deals.<br>Rejecting Trump’s authority under IEEPA does not mean he lacks all authority for tariffs. The administration is correct in arguing that Congress has repeatedly deferred to presidents on tariffs, granting them sweeping authority.<br>For example, the ruling does not affect Trump’s “sector tariffs” under the Trade Expansion Act, which impose 25% levies on steel, aluminum, and auto imports.<br>Likewise, the court acknowledged that Trump has the authority under Section 122 of the Trade Act to impose tariffs of up to 15% for 150 days to address “fundamental international payment problems,” including trade deficits. After conducting further investigation into these problems, he can then impose long-term tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.<br>But Congress may have to act if it wants to allow the Trump administration to continue to use tariffs as a trade strategy. A court just removed the stick Trump used to force other nations to the negotiating table.<br>Absent congressional action, it may even be possible for companies to seek reimbursement for past payments under the Trump tariffs. Both the suspension of tariffs and the risk of reimbursement could exacerbate the current deficit. The revenue from the tariffs was factored into the projections behind Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”<br>Congress will need to demonstrate that it is nimble enough to operate effectively in this fast-paced market. It will also have to decide whether it wants to give Trump time to close his deals. Whether you agree with Trump’s gamble or not, we already have chips on the table.<br>Moreover, there is strong support for reciprocal tariffs to match the costs and barriers placed on our goods by other countries.<br>Congress has already indicated that it is willing to block Democratic measures to derail the negotiations. Recently, the Senate rejected an effort to undo Trump’s tariffs on most U.S. trading partners in a tied vote of 49 to 49 (with three Republican senators voting with the Democrats).<br>Trump may find that his razor-thin margin will not last much longer. Polls indicate that the public is wary of the impact of the tariffs. Many of us view tariffs as a tax on consumers and generally a poor idea.<br>Nevertheless, Trump was right about the market barriers and unfair treatment shown by other countries, including some of our closest allies. The resulting deals will be good for the United States and could represent the most significant move toward open markets in a generation.<br>These are difficult issues, and we need to tamp down the rhetoric. These judges are not the enemy. Neither is Trump. Trump is trying to use every possible law to achieve historic reforms. These judges are trying to guarantee that such priorities do not take precedence over the rule of law.<br>Just as Congress needs to be more nimble, so does the president. He can appeal this case while using less controversial means to maintain the tariff pressure on these countries as we work toward these bilateral trade agreements.<br>In the meantime, the Senate should use its leverage at this moment to not only push the administration for a fast resolution of these trade talks, but far greater reductions in federal spending.<br>Trump has shocked a long-comatose system in Washington. However, it has been more shock than therapy without free trade deals and deficit reductions.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R151" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">152</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/29/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">OVER MY SHOULDER CỦA MAULDIN ECONOMICS:<br>Bài hôm nay của OMS vô cùng có ích.

The court ruled that the IEEPA - International Emergency Economic Powers Act - “does not authorize the President to impose unbounded tariffs”. <br>Subject to appeal, this nullifies all the tariffs imposed by the administration under that authority. These include all the “reciprocal” tariffs announced on April 2 (including the 10% baseline that was still in effect until Wednesday), as well as the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 20% duties on China related to border crossings and fentanyl traffic. <br>Is this the end of the trade war? Is the US system of “checks and balances” providing the sort of rule of law we were promised in elementary school? Or is this ruling nothing more than a nuisance and a delay for the administration, which remains determined to impose tariffs and force trade deals? Unfortunately for investors hoping for trade peace, this ruling will most likely only slow Trump down. At the margin, this will be positive for US markets. <br>But the tariff war is far from over. <br>First, the good news. There are reasons to think this ruling from the US Court of International Trade may survive administration appeals. This court was not expected to be hostile toward the administration. The three-judge panel that ruled unanimously on the decision included judges appointed by Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan and Trump himself. <br>In fact, Trump’s Department of Justice was pushing for this and other trade cases to be heard by this court, thinking it would be sympathetic to the administration’s cause. <br>This view proved mistaken. While the courts have a history of deferring to the president on matters of national security, the trade court clearly thought Trump overstepped the law and at least some observers think its ruling may survive a review by the supreme court. <br>The problem is that while the IEEPA may not give Trump the authority to impose sweeping tariffs, other statutes do. In its ruling, the court explained that the IEEPA of 1977 was designed to limit the president’s authority to impose tariffs. IEEPA was passed to supersede the Trading With The Enemy Act of 1917, which Richard Nixon had previously used to impose universal tariffs. <br>However, in its ruling, the court specifically named two other statutes - section 122 and section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 - that could be used to impose tariffs, on the grounds of “large and serious balance-of-payments deficits” (section 122) or “unfair trade <br>practices” (section 301). In other words, the court didn’t say Trump can’t impose tariffs. It just said he needs to impose them under different legal authorities. Section 301 tariffs are directed at countries guilty of unfair trade practices and so first require an investigation by the US Trade Representative. This can be a slow process, and a public comment period is required, which can make it even slower. <br>However, China has already been subjected to a 301 investigation, so 301 tariffs could be imposed on China relatively quickly. Once the initial procedures complete, section 301 tariffs can be set high <br>and last for a long time - some are still in place from Trump’s first term. <br>Section 122 tariffs are intended to address trade imbalances and do not require an investigation. But they come with limits. They max out at 15% and expire after 150 days without approval and extension by Congress. <br>How might Trump utilize these statutes? If his appeal against the ruling on IEEPA tariffs fails, he could propose that his new 10% universal, or “baseline,” tariff be reapplied as a section 122 tariff. He could then ask Congress to extend it beyond the 150-day period. <br>Congress might even be persuaded to write these baseline tariffs into the budget currently being negotiated in the Senate. That would have the added benefit of helping to constrain the US fiscal deficit, even if it doesn’t fully offset domestic tax cuts (see Tax Cuts Versus Tariff Hikes). <br>While the universal 10% tariff helps with raising government revenue, it is not much of a negotiation tool. However, Trump can still threaten countries with section 301 investigations and resulting tariffs if they do not line up to make deals with the US. <br>The bottom line is that this ruling is a marginal positive. It could at least succeed in slowing the imposition of punitively high tariff rates, which would give investors and businesses more time to adjust. And it is encouraging to see the rule of law being upheld by the courts. <br>The problem is that over the year Congress has written laws that give the president many ways to impose tariffs. The trade war, and the policy uncertainty surrounding it, is not over.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R152" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">153</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/29/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">GIÁO DỤC NGOÀI CHỢ TRỜI…<br>Hôm nay, giáo sư Jonathan Turley cho chúng ta biết một nghệ thuật phi thường trên thị trường giáo dục: giới hữu trách học khu các trường công lập tại thành phố San Francisco vừa nâng cao sĩ số học sinh tốt nghiệp bằng cách hạ thấp số điểm tiêu chuẩn.

It is known as the New Grading for Equity plan. That is far easier than actually teaching students to meet basic proficiency levels.  Even in the uber-liberal district, parents were outraged and there are reports that the plan is now dead.<br>The Voice reports that:<br>&quot; Superintendent of Schools Maria Su plans to unveil a new Grading for Equity plan on Tuesday that will go into effect this fall at 14 high schools and cover over 10,000 students. The school district is already negotiating with an outside consultant to train teachers in August in a system that awards a passing C grade to as low as a score of 41 on a 100-point exam.<br>&quot;  … It is buried in a three-word phrase on the last page of a PowerPoint presentation embedded in the school board meeting’s 25-page agenda…While the school district acknowledges that parent aversion to this grading approach is typically high and understands the need for “vigilant communication,” outreach to parents has been minimal and may be nonexistent….<br>*  Grading for Equity eliminates homework or weekly tests from being counted in a student’s final semester grade. All that matters is how the student scores on a final examination, which can be taken multiple times. Students can be late turning in an assignment or showing up to class or not showing up at all without it affecting their academic grade. Currently, a student needs a 90 for an A and at least 61 for a D. Under the San Leandro Unified School District’s grading for equity system touted by the San Francisco Unified School District and its consultant, a student with a score as low as 80 can attain an A and as low as 21 can pass with a D.<br>The school district is not the first to “solve” the problem by lowering standards to guarantee greater success.<br>Public educators have continued to lower proficiency requirements and cancel gifted programs to “even the playing field.” The result has been to further hide the dismal scores and educational standards of many public school districts.<br>Teachers and school boards are killing the institution of public education by treating children and parents more like captives than consumers. They are force-feeding social and political priorities, including passes for engaging in approved protests.<br>Faced with abysmal scores, particularly for minority students, school boards and union officials have called for lowering or suspending proficiency standards or declared meritocracy to be a form of “white supremacy.” Gifted and talented programs are being eliminated in the name of “equity.”<br>At the same time, we have previously discussed how schools have been dropping the use of standardized tests to achieve diversity goals in admissions. Cal State dropped standardized testing “to level the playing field” for minority students.<br>The result is that colleges and universities are dealing with students who lack proficiency in basic subjects. This year, Harvard University was forced to introduce remedial, high-school-level math courses for its students due to falling scholastic standards.<br>Notably, this “Grading for Equity” plan was not revealed to the public, as the district reportedly set about training teachers on the plan while preparing for the likely backlash. All of this was easier than getting the teachers and their union to improve their performance.  San Francisco has the third-largest expenditures per student at $23,654. Yet, they wanted to lower the standards to improve their statistical success artificially.<br>Of course, the losers will remain the students who graduate without basic proficiencies in an increasingly difficult job market. These administrators and teachers are leaving them in the same vicious cycle with little real opportunity to escape.<br>Yet, these same unions and teachers oppose every effort to fund vouchers to allow families to seek schools that can offer their children a real future. Democratic politicians have joined that opposition in preserving this failing system. The status quo has remained unchanged in these major cities for decades, as politicians replicate the same generational failures.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R153" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">154</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/29/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TRANG NHẤT LÀ NHẤT…<br>Với tiêu đề “The Front Page”, tiết mục điểm tin của The Free Press có thể làm người đọc bị bội thực suốt một ngày vì không chỉ thông báo ngần ấy tin mà còn giới thiệu từng bài giúp độc giả nắm vững nội dung có tóm lược - rồi tha hồ chọn! <br>https://www.thefp.com/p/is-doge-dead-plus<br>Is DOGE Dead?

After spotting “a list of new horrors,” she said, “I text my deputies, and we assign cases, and we get cranking.”<br>The Trump administration is on the hunt for campuses that have allegedly tolerated antisemitism, threatening to yank billions of dollars in federal research funding from Harvard and other top-name schools. The White House has accused universities of failing to protect Jewish students during campus protests against Israel over the war in Gaza that began in 2023.<br>Yet the idea of targeting elite schools by withholding federal funds originated years earlier. Many conservatives have long studied ways to combat what they view as the liberal, anti-Western ills of American higher education. Some are now in the Trump administration, trying to push change.<br>While Dhillon was a student at Dartmouth College, she was editor in chief of a conservative college newspaper that sued the school in a free-speech case. She said the lawsuit, which the paper won, cemented her career path. In 2018, she was the lawyer on a lawsuit that forced the University of California, Berkeley to revamp its speaker policies. <br>Trump has since become preoccupied with the White House push -  headed by Stephen Miller, the president’s top domestic policy adviser - to influence U.S. universities, particularly Harvard, according to administration officials. Harvard is going to court Thursday to oppose administration efforts to forbid international students from enrolling at the school.<br>“Harvard wants to fight,” Trump told reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office. “They want to show how smart they are, and they’re getting their ass kicked.”<br>Leaders in Trump circles have argued that universities were so deeply stewed in progressive ideas that small, incremental changes wouldn’t be enough - that the federal government needed to force a major cultural shift. For years, the notion went nowhere.<br>Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, said he, Miller and others close to the president talked about asserting more control over universities in the early days of Trump’s first term. “The idea was nothing more than a concept back then,” said Bannon, a Georgetown and Harvard graduate. “You couldn’t even call it an idea.”<br>Then a punch in the face grabbed Trump’s attention.<br>A demonstration against the war in Gaza at the Harvard campus on Oct. 14, 2023.

Neither the attacker, who was later arrested, nor Williams were students at the school.<br>Video of the attack went viral and Williams, sporting a black eye, appeared on Fox News.<br>Kirk recalled Trump saying at the time, We’ve got to do something about this. Kirk said he told Trump that it was a chance to stand up for conservative students, and that they talked about withholding federal funding for free-speech violations. Donald Trump Jr. has credited Kirk for pushing the strategy. <br>About two weeks after the altercation, Trump brought Williams onstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Trump said he planned to sign an executive order requiring colleges and universities to uphold free speech if they want federal research money.<br>“If they don’t, it will be very costly,” Trump said.<br>Soon after, Trump signed the executive order. It was stalled by opponents, who included congressional Republicans and some in the White House. Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, chair of the Senate’s education committee, questioned whether the order was constitutional. <br> “I don’t want to see Congress or the president or the department of anything creating speech codes to define what you can say on campus,” Alexander said at the time. <br>The roadblock echoed an earlier era. President Richard Nixon wanted to cut off Defense Department funding from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in response to campus antiwar protests, but members of his administration pushed back, historian Michael Koncewicz said.<br>The first Trump administration nonetheless laid legal groundwork for the current fight.<br>In 2020, after the administration tried and failed to stop money going to projects Trump opposed, the Office of Management and Budget adjusted federal grant regulations.<br>The new rule permitted the termination of projects “if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” <br>It was an opening waiting for its moment.   <br>Anti-Vietnam War demonstrators marching past the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., on April 18, 1972.<br>Anti-Vietnam War demonstrators marching past the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., on April 18, 1972.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R., N.Y.), a top Trump ally and Harvard graduate, drew national attention with her inquiry. <br>“Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate MIT’s code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment, yes or no?” she asked Sally Kornbluth, the MIT president. Kornbluth didn’t say yes, it was. Neither did the two other presidents.<br>Stefanik said Claudine Gay, then-president of Harvard, should resign. <br>Claudine Gay, left, then-president of Harvard University; Liz Magill, then-president of University of Pennsylvania, testifying before the House Education and Workforce Committee in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 5, 2023.<br>Claudine Gay, left, then-president of Harvard University; Liz Magill, then-president of University of Pennsylvania, testifying before the House Education and Workforce Committee in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 5, 2023.

Both Gay and Liz Magill, then-president of University of Pennsylvania, resigned in the lingering criticism that followed.<br>“It shows that it was a seminal moment,” Stefanik said, “and it set off an earthquake in higher ed.”<br>Conservative think tanks, packed with Trump allies, seized the moment.<br>In January 2024, the Heritage Foundation held an event to launch a National Task Force to Combat Antisemitism. A number of Trump’s first-term officials joined, including David Friedman, former ambassador to Israel. He said antisemitism had become “a full five-alarm fire” that has “infiltrated and insinuated itself into the halls of the Ivy League.”<br>“You can walk into a cocktail party in Manhattan and spout Nazi rhetoric and you’ll be shown the door,” Friedman said in a video aired during the task-force launch. “But if you express the conviction that Israel should not exist, you will probably be poured a drink.”<br>Friedman proposed a four-point prescription, beginning with “take away their money,” he said.<br>“Hate groups must lose their tax-exempt status, and universities that don’t protect their students should lose their government funding,” Friedman said.<br>Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.<br>Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. Photo: Sophie Park/<br>Bloomberg News<br>Trump’s team was emboldened by his 2024 victory, which drew support across nearly every demographic group, including a significant boost from younger voters.  <br>Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, believed he had a receptive audience in the second Trump administration. He provided a list of schools he believed should be investigated, based, in part, on his own unwelcome experiences speaking there. The list included Harvard, Columbia, Duke and New York universities, as well as U Penn and University of California, Irvine.<br>Within about two weeks of Trump’s inauguration, the Justice Department announced the new Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. The Justice Department later released a list of 10 targeted universities, including several on Klein’s list. <br>Trump said recently he wanted to redirect federal funds from elite institutions to trade schools, and he has asked for suggestions about how to carry that out, officials said. The president has zeroed in on Harvard’s endowment, telling aides that a university with some of the country’s wealthiest backers doesn’t need federal funds.  <br>“It was kind of sticker-shock to him,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said. “I think that it’s right to investigate and take a look at all of it.”<br>Kirk said he speaks frequently with the president, telling him to “crush these universities with every power you have.” He was in the Oval Office Wednesday when the president said Harvard was going to get its backside kicked.<br>Recent polls, including a survey by The Wall Street Journal this spring, show Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to cutting university funding for medical research. A Journal poll also found that some arguments from the Trump administration about the threat might gain support, such as casting the cuts as a way to protect Jewish students from antisemitism.<br>Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk, center, at the Oval Office where President Trump spoke Wednesday about Harvard’s prospects.<br>Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk, center, at the Oval Office where President Trump spoke Wednesday about Harvard’s prospects. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images<br>The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a leading critic of universities it alleges squash conservative perspectives, has expressed opposition to Trump’s tactics, including the threat to cut research funding at Harvard.<br>“The government can grant and reject grant requests for many reasons. But it can’t do so for unconstitutional ones. And that’s exactly what is happening here,” said Tyler Coward, the foundation’s lead counsel for government affairs. “The problems that exist at Harvard, and there are many, cannot distract from the very real threat of the government wielding its immense funding power to control America’s colleges and universities.” <br>Top Trump officials are closely monitoring the words and actions of university leaders. Columbia University interim President Claire Shipman in her recent commencement speech mentioned the absence of pro-Palestinian student Mahmoud Khalil, who is the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. His detention has drawn protests.<br>The following day, the university received a notice of civil-rights violation. McMahon said the notice was in the works before Shipman’s speech. <br>“President Shipman is trying to balance different factions, but I was disappointed,” McMahon said. Naming Khalil wasn’t “necessary for her to say, considering all of the campus unrest that had happened,” McMahon said.<br>White House officials told Columbia it should be mindful during its search for a permanent president that such comments from university leaders would again jeopardize federal funding, a senior administration official said.<br>Dhillon, head of the DOJ’s civil-rights division, said “all these schools are in the penalty box, they’re all misbehaving.” <br>Harvard is taking an aggressive approach, she said.<br>Columbia, meanwhile, “they’re playing dead,” Dhillon said. “It doesn’t mean their intentions are any different.”<br>Write to Eliza Collins at eliza.collins@wsj.com, Douglas Belkin at Doug.Belkin@wsj.com, Tarini Parti at tarini.parti@wsj.com and Liz Essley Whyte at liz.whyte@wsj.com</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R155" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">156</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/29/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TỔNG THỐNG MỸ NGÂY NGÔ ĐẾN NGỐ VÌ PUTIN<br>Sinh tại Liên Xô, nay là nghệ sĩ và danh hài tại Anh rồi ngỡ ngàng về sự ngớ ngẩn của Tây phương trước các chế độ gian ác, Konstantin Kisin bèn mở substack trình bày dăm ba sự thật.

(Dmitry Lovetsky/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)<br>The Russian president hasn’t just gone ‘crazy.’ He’s always been like this.<br>(By Konstantin Kisin - The Free Press - 05.28.25 - International)<br>Listen to Article<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Prompted by a wave of missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities which killed 12 and injured dozens over the weekend, President Donald Trump expressed his frustrations with Russia’s president on Truth Social Sunday, saying, “I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!”<br>This is an interesting theory. Before we examine it in detail, it is worth pointing out that numerous United States presidents have attempted to believe Putin could be reasoned with. President George W. Bush famously “looked into Putin’s eyes and saw a soul,” while Bill Clinton insisted that Putin could be relied on to stick to their agreements. U.S. presidents prefer (or at least pretend) to believe this, because it prevents them from having to face the reality of who Putin has always been, and what that means for America and the West. But, far more importantly, this belief is also a product of the American psyche, which makes even the most cynical U.S. politicians susceptible to manipulation by those who operate within a different moral framework.<br>You will not find a bigger fan of the United States than me. Spending time in the U.S. is always a joy - one cannot help but be inspired by the culture of openness, cooperation, and positivity. The story of America is that anything is possible, especially when good people get together to do business, make money, and thrive. While most Americans take these cultural traits as given, the reality is they are rare and are, in no small part, the foundation of America’s success. Americans are widely regarded around the world as extremely friendly, welcoming, proactive, and constructive.<br>But every coin has two sides. The trade-off of this business-focused, open-minded, good faith, let’s-make-money approach is a consistent failure to contend with the reality that not all cultures and not all people are like this.<br>“The positive attitude that is the default setting in America is widely regarded in many parts of the world as evidence of unseriousness and naïveté,” writes Konstantin Kisin. (Shepard Sherbell/Corbis via Getty Images)<br>My Western friends often say that I come across as “intense,” “unsmiling,” and even “angry” in interviews. By American standards, they are certainly right. Which is why they are always surprised when I tell them the story of showing a Russian family member a school photo of mine. “Why have you all got that idiotic American smile?” she asked.<br>The open, welcoming, and positive attitude that is the default setting in America is widely regarded in many parts of the world as evidence of gullibility, unseriousness, and naïveté. It is seen, sometimes justifiably, as an attitude that leaves people vulnerable to deception. Not because Americans are stupid, but because their desire to believe in the good of others makes it harder for them to recognize when others are not, in fact, good.<br>To fully grasp the cultural chasm between Russia and America, you need to understand the history of the two countries.<br>The U.S. is a nation of people who conquered a continent. It is filled with the descendants of those who left their homelands to seek a better life on the other side of the world. Facing immense hardships, they did not just overcome, they triumphed. In a few centuries, successive waves of newcomers banded together to build a nation out of nothing through hard work, a go-get-it mentality, and a high trust, collaborative society. Americans have no comparable genetic memory of being invaded by powerful enemies, of being held down and oppressed by foreign conquerors, of mass persecution or extermination by their own governments, of totalitarianism, famine, or failure. The American ethos is defined by overcoming the challenges the country has faced in its history: The Great Depression was merely a precursor to the country’s explosion into an economic and manufacturing superpower. Pearl Harbor was followed not only by overwhelming victory in World War II but by America emerging as the world’s dominant nation and the center of Western civilization.<br>Women taking water flowing from broken water mains during the siege of Leningrad, 1941–1944. (Sovfoto/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)<br>Anything is possible, problems are challenges to be solved, and the future is bright.<br>Now consider the history of Russia. One of the founding experiences of the Russian nation is being occupied by the Mongols. The descendants of Genghis Khan wiped out anyone who resisted and subjugated everyone else. Those are horrors equivalent to your country being invaded by ISIS or Khal Drogo from Game of Thrones. They butcher, rape, and torture their way through every major city - and force everyone else to bend the knee.<br>In Russian, this period is called the “Tatar-Mongol Yoke,” a yoke being a device used to join two work animals, such as oxen, together to pull a load.<br>This period of time lasted around 240 years, as long as the entire history of the U.S. To this day, the Russian language contains many Mongolian words, especially those related to taxation, weaponry, and war.<br>Another formative period in Russian history is called Smuta, or Times of Trouble. Ivan the Terrible, infamous for killing his only viable heir in a fit of rage, passed on his crown to a feeble and incapable son, Fyodor I. When Fyodor died without an heir, Russia was thrust into 15 years of chaos in which a succession of usurpers and false claimants battled over the throne. Combined with famine, disease, and a series of foreign invasions, the Times of Trouble saw at least a third of Russia’s population wiped out in just 15 years. One of the key conclusions Russians drew from this is that whatever else he is, a ruler must be strong to maintain order. A weak ruler leads to chaos. And chaos is to be avoided at any cost.<br>How poorly this is understood in the West is ironically and perfectly encapsulated in the different names Russians and English-speakers have for Ivan the Terrible. The word terrible is a telling mistranslation: His moniker in Russian is much more accurately translated as fearsome.<br>In the centuries since, Russia has been repeatedly invaded by its Western neighbors including the Swedes, Lithuanians, Poles, Finns, and, famously, Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler. While these attacks were ultimately repelled, they left deep scars in the Russian psyche. There is little triumphalism about defeating Napoleon, whose invasion saw Moscow burned to the ground. And while victory in the Great Patriotic War, the Russian name for WWII, is much celebrated, it came at the cost of around 20 million lives. For contrast, the United States lost just over 400,000 people in the same conflict.<br>Russian students and revolutionary soldiers staging a pitched battle in the streets of Petrograd against the police during the Russian Revolution, 1917–1923. (via Getty)<br>Compare also the revolutions and civil wars which took place in the two countries. The Russian Revolution, which sparked the Russian Civil War, resulted in the installation of a tyrannical, murderous communist regime which exterminated its enemies, expropriated private property, and instituted a decades-long reign of terror ending in economic collapse and Cold War defeat in 1991. Meanwhile the American Revolution is a story of a successful fight for independence, while the American Civil War, although bloody and painful, is seen as the price of progress on the path to ultimate unification.<br>While American baby boomers lived through a period of economic expansion, success, and triumph, their Russian counterparts - like Putin, born in 1952 - grew up in the aftermath of a devastating war, Joseph Stalin’s slave labor camps, and economic stagnation. By the time they were in their prime, their country collapsed all around them creating chaos, instability, and a sense of loss, humiliation, and exploitation.<br>These historical experiences inevitably produce people who see the world through such different lenses that it might as well be a different world. Centuries of pain, poverty, famine, war, brutality, suspicion, and humiliation do not produce happy, smiling, positive go-getters.<br>Which brings us back to the claim that the normally reasonable, rational, and pragmatic Putin with whom we can do business has suddenly become a different person and gone “CRAZY.” This claim is convenient for a number of reasons.<br>First, it absolves those who have been claiming he is reasonable, rational, and pragmatic while his troops have been butchering civilians, stealing Ukrainian children, and torturing prisoners of war in captivity.<br>Second, it justifies the foreign policy of turning a blind eye to the reality of Putin’s Russia and the man himself. On social media, Americans often accuse me of being a Putin “hater” for stating basic facts about his career history and the regime he has set up in Russia. These facts are worth restating.<br>Putin is a former officer of the KGB, the Soviet Union’s main intelligence and security agency. The agency was the successor to the Cheka and NKVD, which were the tools used by Stalin and other Soviet leaders to murder and imprison dissidents, domestic critics, and foreign defectors. Putin joined the agency long after its crimes under Stalin had been exposed.<br>Putin has never been elected in a free and fair election. He was effectively handed the presidency in 1999 by his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, in exchange for protection, and has held onto power for 26 years, ending Russia’s brief experiment with democracy. Every single one of his political opponents like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Boris Nemtsov, Alexei Navalny, and Garry Kasparov is dead, imprisoned, or in exile.<br>In 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, Putin lied repeatedly that the soldiers without insignia who had taken over the peninsula were not his, saying with a cunning grin that “you can go to a store and buy any kind of uniform.” He later handed out medals to the Russian soldiers involved in the operation.<br>Since the war in Ukraine started, Putin has cleaned house of both liberal and nationalist critics, who have been imprisoned, like Igor Girkin-Strelkov, or assassinated, like Yevgeny Prigozhin.<br>My point is: To anyone who understands the reality of Putin’s regime, the idea that he has “gone CRAZY” and is killing people is . . . well, CRAZY. Putin is in power and retains power precisely because he has always been someone who is prepared to lie, manipulate, and kill to achieve his objectives. That is literally what the KGB trained him to do.<br>In his post criticizing Putin, Trump went on to add: “I’ve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that’s proving to be right.” Finally, it seems, our American friends are beginning to understand who they are dealing with.<br>In his “Long Telegram,” George Kennan famously wrote that Russia was “impervious to logic of reason, and it is highly sensitive to logic of force.” This is why I had high - and so far, false - hopes for Trump’s ability to end the war. I assumed he would understand the obvious: that bringing Putin to the negotiating table would require a carrot and a stick.<br>So far, dangling only the carrot of “ending the killing” and sending a starry-eyed historically and geographically illiterate lawyer to be bamboozled for hours in the Kremlin has, predictably, produced nothing. The only way Trump will get serious negotiations going is to threaten Putin with ramping up not only sanctions but high grade, extensive military aid to Ukraine.<br>As long as that option is not on the table, Putin will keep calling America’s bluff.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R156" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">157</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/29/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">LUẬT SƯ NẶC NÔ CHO MẤY CON NGỰA Ô VÀI ROI VÀO BÀN TỌA<br>Lãnh vài roi không phải vì là ngựa cái mà vì cứ đòi dạng trên ngai, rồi đái lung tung: xem lý lịch thì biết ngay là khai như nước đái quỷ!

The plan was foolproof. It literally had no flaw. Unburdened by what has been, there was no telling what these scrappy gals could do.<br>This column will be part 2 of a continuing series that I call &quot;Black Women in Charge.&quot; (The last one was in 2023, then other news intervened.)<br>Elected after the summer of BLM terror, President Joe Biden put more black females on the U.S. Courts of Appeal than all previous presidents combined. Half of his U.S. attorney nominees were black. Given that only 5% of the nation&#39;s attorneys are black, for the past four years, every black lawyer in the country had a decent shot at becoming a federal prosecutor or judge. (Hence, the expression, the &quot;affirmative action to federal bench pipeline.&quot;)<br>Among the nominees was Rachael Rollins, Biden&#39;s choice to be U.S. attorney for Massachusetts. But things are never easy for a black woman. As put by Charles Pierce, Esquire&#39;s political reporter, two &quot;asshat&quot; senators decided to &quot;demagogue&quot; a &quot;Perfectly Qualified U.S. Attorney Nominee.&quot;<br>Specifically, Sens. Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton opposed Rollins on the grounds that she supported decriminalizing a slew of crimes, such as shoplifting, malicious destruction of property, drug possession with intent to distribute and resisting arrest. (No word yet on how those policies have played out in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, etc.)<br>The Senate split 50-50 on Rollins&#39; nomination.<br>In a transcendent moment of Black Girl Magic, the first black woman vice president cast the 51st vote to make Rollins the first black woman U.S. attorney of Massachusetts. Upon Rollins&#39; confirmation, Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren praised Rollins for &quot;transforming the criminal justice system.&quot;<br>And, boy, were they right! Within two years, Rollins had &quot;transformed&quot; her office into a personal revenge racket, leaking government secrets to harm a political opponent, among other wildly illegal acts. Biden&#39;s own Office of Special Counsel informed him that her violations were “among the most egregious transgressions&quot; the office had ever seen.<br>She resigned before any further action could be taken against her and is currently weighing offers from several Ivy League universities.<br>Atlanta, known as the Black Mecca, is home to a great number of black millionaires. There&#39;s Shelitha Robertson, former assistant city attorney of Atlanta turned lifestyle podcaster, who is so rich she sported a 10-carat diamond ring and drove a Rolls Royce. How was she able to afford such luxuries on an assistant city attorney&#39;s salary, you ask? It turned out all her bling was purchased with the $15 million she stole from COVID-19 relief funds on behalf of her nonexistent 400 employees.<br>In addition to the swag, Robertson used her stolen money to make a campaign donation to Fani Willis, whose name may ring a bell. Immediately upon her election to Atlanta district attorney, Willis announced a fishing expedition against Trump and his allies, accusing them of a criminal conspiracy for engaging in standard, everyday politicking. If Trump&#39;s challenging the results of Georgia&#39;s presidential election constitutes a RICO violation, then Al Gore should be hunted down and given the death penalty for the 2000 election. (Is there a solar-powered electric chair yet?)<br>To assist her office in pursuing the crackpot charges, Willis did what a child would know is wrong. I know! I&#39;ll hire my boyfriend and then he can take me on vacations with all the money I&#39;m paying him!<br>Even Stacey Abrams was saying, “Oh c’mon!”<br>For her comical corruption, the Georgia Court of Appeals removed Willis from the case. No other D.A. showed any interest in pursuing the charges, suggesting some flaws in Fani&#39;s theory of the case. (At least Gore can rest easy.) Willis&#39; office was later ordered to pay about $75,000 in fines and attorneys&#39; fees.<br>Just last week, Charlotte, North Carolina, city council member Tiawana Brown was indicted, along with her daughters Tijema Brown and Antionette Rouse, for stealing at least $124,165 in COVID relief money and spending it on luxury goods, including a $15,000 birthday party featuring a horse-drawn carriage and a throne. (Legal tip: If the criminal complaint against your client includes the words &quot;horse-drawn carriage&quot; or &quot;throne,” start negotiating a plea.)<br>Far from contrite, Brown seems a tad miffed that anyone would expect her to resign because of the multiple felony-charging indictment, saying, &quot;Why would I resign? I haven&#39;t been convicted of anything.&quot;<br>My final entry in this week&#39;s installment of Black Women in Charge is Dr. Karen Johnson, who describes herself as &quot;World Changer,&quot; &quot;History Maker&quot; and &quot;Visionary,&quot; proving how systemic racism crushes black people&#39;s self-esteem. (I&#39;ve been unable, so far, to determine which medical specialty Dr. Johnson practices but I&#39;ll keep digging.)<br>In March 2021, Dr. Johnson was appointed director of Washington state&#39;s first-ever Office of Equity. Getting off to a great start, she told a local NBC news affiliate, “No Black person in their right mind ... wants to be leading this kind of work, convincing white people they want to do something they have no intention of doing.”<br>In short order, a third of the office had quit over Johnson&#39;s sexism, racism and fat-shaming. At one point, she announced, &quot;I generally distrust Mexican people.&quot; Denying it was racist, she said, &quot;That was not my takeaway from the conversation.&quot; After two years promoting &quot;equity,&quot; Johnson was fired.<br>But there&#39;s never a shortage of jobs for black women accusing everyone else of racism, so Dr. Johnson is now executive director of the Texas Center for Justice and Equity, and this Black Women in Charge series may never end.<br>COPYRIGHT 2025 ANN COULTER</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R157" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">158</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/29/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỤC DIVIDEND CAFÉ HÔM NAY CỦA THE BAHNSEN GROUP<br>https://podcast.dividendcafe.com/episodes/wednesday-may-28-2025?utm_campaign=Dividend%20Cafe&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--6hSnFOuS4zWbupCiDsYJyiZgXjIN-V4W1yL5cr5v7tKUOvBL4ToaZPEcgr_1BTfuxZFQqaGw2sy4sKDDDSGFUlPEuFzwBD-NjAPBc-zSnALT1tKQ&amp;_hsmi=363756064&amp;utm_content=363756064&amp;utm_source=hs_email<br>DIVIDEND CAFE by THE BAHNSEN GROUP<br>Daily Recap - May 28, 2025<br>Dow: -245 (-0.58%) <br>S&amp;P: -0.56% <br>Nasdaq: -0.51% <br>2-Year Treasury Yield: 3.99% (+4 basis points) <br>10-Year Treasury Yield: 4.47% (+4 basis points)<br>Top-performing sector: Real Estate (-0.02%)<br>Bottom-performing sector: Utilities (-1.44%)<br>WTI Crude Oil: $61.58/barrel (+1.13%)<br>What&#39;s On David&#39;s Mind<br>  It is not foreign to us that many people fall victim to the allure of market timing at moments when it is most foolish to do so.  In fact, it is human nature, and we continue to largely offer our services to human beings, meaning it is part of the world we signed up for.  It is neither offensive, surprising, nor mysterious; it is just part of humanity.  People believe that things which are not foreseeable are foreseeable, and then that solutions which do not match what is not foreseeable somehow make sense.  And then, when it all goes astray, they get stuck in the doom loop of regret.  And it does not matter a whit what the catalyst was (“everyone knew Obama” was this or “everyone knew Trump” was that or “we all can see that” … - you get the idea).  People are people, and so the desire to believe one can see that which they cannot see or solve for that which they cannot solve is innate.<br>  But I will say this… nothing breaks down this human imperfection more than markets.  Nothing is more consistently humbling in correcting one’s view of both premises and conclusions than markets.  And some of us happen to think this is all by design.<br>Ask TBG <br>[Mục hỏi đáp rất hay, nhất là câu thứ nhì, ‘tại sao thị trường cứ sụt và lên giá vì phát biểu (cà chớn) của Trump’? và câu trả lời của David Bahnsen] <br>“I understand the new tax bill is projected to increase the debt by <br>$2-3 trillion over the next decade, but to what extent can that estimate absorb one or more unforeseen events like a big recession, a pandemic, a war, or some other exogenous shock to the system?”~ Scott S.<br>By definition, “unforeseen” events can’t be “foreseen” in projections.  That said, the CBO calculations are supposed to, in theory, account for the zigs and zags of things over time.  This is an unfair expectation for any prognosticator, so I give the CBO grace here.  When we talk about a stock market growing at 9% per year, we generally mean +21% one year and -15% one year and so forth and so on, with an average return of 9%, despite high variance around the return.  The variability of GDP growth estimates is much, much less than stock market variance around its mean, but estimates for debt growth and economic growth do assume some variability along the way, with the geometric average being what matters at the end of the decade.~ David L. Bahnsen<br>“With Trump’s consistent practice of on-again/off-again tariffs, why do the markets still react so much to his pronouncements? He announces higher tariffs on Europe, and markets drop. Next day, he delays those tariffs, and markets go back up. Why do the markets still pay attention to him?”~ Rod K.<br>  Remember that the term “markets” is quite amorphous and all-encompassing.  One could argue that “markets” dropped 700 points on the initial news Friday (after the Europe tariff tweet threat), but with NO change whatsoever, reversed course 500 or so points a few hours later.  “Markets” include algorithmic, high frequency, short-term, knee-jerk players (for a few minutes); it includes less-informed and more impulsive or pedestrian players prone to emotive response; AND it includes those investors willing to buy from the first two groups.  I would suggest that “markets” include those reacting to his pronouncements, AND those who are not.  It is just a matter of sequence.~ David L.

Photo: majid asgaripour/Reuters<br>The nuclear negotiations between Iran and the U.S. appear to be at an impasse. The temptation for President Trump will be to declare victory and pocket a status quo in which Tehran refrains from testing a nuke. The White House may even find comfort in a question senior officials in the Biden administration asked themselves: Why hasn’t Iran already gone nuclear?<br>The Trump administration entered negotiations without clear positions on crucial issues, surprising and cheering the Iranian side. But Tehran’s happiness was short-lived. Negotiators Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio subsequently declared that uranium enrichment in Iran is unacceptable. Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, hasn’t broken off talks, indicating hope that Mr. Trump will change his mind or won’t preclude an interim deal that allows domestic enrichment.<br>Tehran’s diplomatic maneuvering and prevarication is incessant. If Mr. Trump grows tired of it, he could give Israel the green-light to knock out Iran’s nuclear infrastructure and ballistic-missile plants. This option doesn’t appeal to him as it requires a U.S. military backstop. More appealing to Mr. Trump is to continue talking, discourage Israeli military action, and default to “maximum pressure.” He wouldn’t mind punting troublesome issues into the future. He may hope sanctions and whatever else his administration can muster will eventually bring Tehran around. This option will unavoidably reanimate the question of why the clerical regime hasn’t already gone nuclear.<br>The Islamic Republic doesn’t have the best nuclear engineers, and Iranian manufacturing is hardly first-rate. But Iran does have a sophisticated, illicit dual-use import network, and its talent base is as good as Pakistan’s when Islamabad went nuclear in 1998. Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium grew enormously from 2021-25, yet Mr. Khamenei chose not to test an atomic device during the Biden administration.<br>Mr. Trump may know that round two of maximum pressure has poor odds of stopping Iranian nuclear progress. Sanctions have always been the preferred choice of both parties in Washington. During the first Trump administration it was widely believed that economic pressure could crack the clerical regime before it went nuclear. Amping up sanctions on the Islamic Republic now will be much more difficult, in part because Beijing has moved squarely into Tehran’s corner. Sanctions aren’t a quick-fix policy solution. To work, they take time. The Iranian atomic-arms program is more advanced now than it has ever been.<br>Iran won’t be content to remain a nuclear threshold state forever. In the past the mullahs could project power via proxy warfare or the threat of long-range ballistic missiles. Now, thanks to the Israelis, they don’t even have an adequate homeland defense. Mr. Khamenei is 86. Will his successor also choose not to test a nuke? What about the Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders who oversee Iran’s nuclear-arms program? With America retrenching globally, friend and foe alike will want the security of a bomb.<br>Fear of foreign enemies fades quickly in the Muslim Middle East, where internal and external politics revolve around hard power. Aggressive men keep probing. Five months into Mr. Trump’s second term, the mullahs are no longer afraid of the unpredictable American president who killed Qasem Soleimani in 2020. “In matters such as the purchase of Gaza and Greenland, the imposition of new tariffs, and even negotiations related to the Ukraine War, Trump first applied maximum pressure, but ultimately left room for retreat,” is the assessment of Nournews, the mouthpiece for Iran’s national security council.<br>The Trump administration has convinced many in Tehran that the president doesn’t want another conflict in the region. His threats of fire and fury are becoming more recognizably Middle Eastern - words substitute for actions. Given all the advanced centrifuges and the ever-deeper bomb-proof underground enrichment sites, the military option is becoming less credible. For Israel, it’s now or never. The U.S. has patience with threats that are existential only to its allies.<br>Mr. Khamenei will consider all this as he contemplates the most serious decision of his tenure: whether finally to cross the nuclear threshold. How scary does he think America is under Mr. Trump? Everything hinges on the answer to that question.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R159" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">160</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/28/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">“ALL THINGS” TUẦN NÀY  CỦA KIMBERLEY STRASSEL:<br>Mục này khỏi cần ăn gian, chỉ thêm đầy bụng!<br>https://www.wsj.com/opinion/reconciling-republicans-3a9a431b<br>Newsletter: All Things with Kim Strassel<br>Opinion - All Things with Kim Strassel<br>Reconciling Republicans<br>Trump’s tax bill hits the Senate - and there’s more agreement than not.<br>Kimberley A. Strassel<br>(By Kimberley A. Strassel - WSJ - May 28, 2025 1:12 pm ET)<br>Newsletter: All Things with Kim Strassel<br>A newsy analysis of the workings of D.C. (and beyond), providing the inside track on both the overhyped and overlooked events of the week.<br>Subscribe here, and read this week’s edition below:<br>Reconciling Republicans<br>The Beltway press corps loves predicting GOP failure, and so it goes with the House GOP tax- and spending-cut bill now headed to the Senate. Media seers foretell irreconcilable Senate differences, a House-Senate war, Donald Trump showdowns and possible collapse.<br>Real challenges do exist, but the Senate path is actually more straightforward than the House’s was. The politics of the Republican Senate are less complicated, the numbers (a bit) more generous, and the members generally sympathetic to the need to keep the House on board. And always remember that a Senate win here is 51 votes - not unanimity. House Republicans hold 53 seats, though they could lose up to three members with Vice President JD Vance serving as a tiebreaker. Here are the main sticking points and how GOP senators envision working through them:<br>* Taxes: Most Senate Republicans would prefer to retain the current limit on the state and local tax deduction, and several are publicly trashing the expensive increase won by blue-state House Republicans. Most of these are statements for the record. Don’t expect the Senate to insist on real (or possibly any) change. Senators don’t like the policy but appreciate the tricky politics and the difficulty House Speaker Mike Johnson had negotiating a final SALT deal. (Many senators were once House members.)<br>* Senate Republicans instead have their own tax demand: making permanent business tax breaks in the bill, including bonus depreciation and research-and-development expensing. Republican Leader John Thune, Whip John Barrasso and Finance Chairman Mike Crapo all consider this a priority. House Republicans limited the duration of the breaks to keep down costs, so resolution of the issue may come down to the Senate GOP’s ability to cut spending elsewhere (see below).<br>* Medicaid: Maine’s Susan Collins, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, Missouri’s Josh Hawley and Kansas’ Jerry Moran have all warned against Medicaid reform and specifically pointed to provisions in the House bill that limit states’ ability to charge provider taxes or impose work requirements. But consider their language: Murkowski notes the Medicaid provisions are “very challenging”; Collins says she wants to make sure work requirements are “carefully drafted”; Moran wants colleagues to consider consequences for rural hospitals. No one is revolting (yet), and most complaints center on the contours of the changes, not the idea of reform. Senate Republicans see tinkering to be done here, but say most of the party is growing comfortable with House reforms like work requirements.<br>* Green tax credits: This may prove one of the toughest problems to solve, since the divide over the Joe Biden subsidies does not fall along the usual big-government/small-government lines. The handouts benefit some states and industries more than others, and senators representing those interests are deeply vested in keeping the subsidies. Murkowski, Moran, North Carolina’s Thom Tillis and Utah’s John Curtis recently warned Thune against killing the corporate pork, while North Dakota’s Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven and West Virginia’s Shelley Moore Capito have also demanded changes. Yet the credits are a huge pot of (wasted) money, disliked by many base voters, and a ripe target for Senate conservatives. A lot will be in the mix in these negotiations, and this is the bit of the Senate bill that retains the biggest potential to infuriate House conservatives.<br>* Spending: This is also a bigger fight, as a bloc of Senate fiscal hawks are insisting the bill do more to roll back Biden’s blowout spending - and say they won’t budge without more savings. The House bill claims it accomplishes $1.5 trillion in spending cuts, though that’s in doubt after its spendy SALT deal; many Senate Republicans have the goal of hitting a (legitimate) $2 trillion. And fiscal hawks might be willing to settle for that modest increase—if it is accompanied by leadership promises of a “process” to more systematically review spending in the coming year. The press is presenting this as a standoff, given greater cuts will be opposed by moderates. Yet that assumes the moderates are gettable, or want to be got - which gets to . . .<br>* The numbers: Republicans leaders are currently working to achieve caucuswide agreement. But who is to say Collins, who is up for election next year in Maine, might not see it as politically advantageous to vote against the bill - to demonstrate her independence from Trump and his policies? Murkowski, for her part, might ultimately consider it too hard to get to yes. Consider how the dynamics change if the party isn’t chasing those two votes. There are limits to this scenario, of course, as numbers remain tight. But the simple fact is that Thune has a bit of a margin, and that means that no one senator is king.<br>The debt ceiling: Kentucky’s Rand Paul - infamous for voting against his own party’s budget products -  surprised his colleagues recently when he said he’d be willing to vote even for this bill’s “wimpy and anemic” spending cuts, though not if the bill also raises the debt ceiling. Alas (for him), the Senate’s plan is to up the House’s ante of a $4 trillion debt increase, since the new limit would likely be hit in the fall of 2026 - forcing the GOP into another debt-ceiling fight right before the midterms. That makes Paul a lost vote, while an increase could upset House conservatives. But leaders note that nearly every House conservative recently voted for the $4 trillion hike (something many had previously vowed never to do) so are banking that they might be willing to swallow a bit more.<br>Easy? No. But not destined for failure. Senatorial ego will demand that chamber put its stamp on the bill, yet so far no one is suggesting a wild rewrite. The bigger hitch may prove to be timing. The Senate isn’t known for its speed, and hasn’t seemed all that bothered by Johnson’s push for a July 4 end date. And the longer this drags on, the more fractious - and nervous - Republicans will become.<br>California Says EVs or Bust<br>California’s response to Washington’s shutdown of the state’s all-electric-vehicle mandate? Never! State Democrats’ aggressive pushback is a reminder the fight over the future of the internal-combustion engine is far from settled. And it suggests Gov. Gavin Newsom isn’t yet willing to drop climate fanaticism as he rebrands for a presidential run.<br>The Senate last week followed the House and voted to kill three Biden waivers that granted California the power to phase out fossil-fuel cars by 2035. Eleven states had adopted the Golden State’s EV mandate, creating a bloc large enough to pressure automakers to phase out internal combustion engines for the rest of the country. Trump campaigned to kill this national mandate, and is expected to sign the repeal soon.<br>Newsom might have seized on the vote as a way walk back a climate agenda that hurt Democrats in the last election. He instead immediately branded the federal vote “illegal” and an “unconstitutional attack on California,” while state Attorney General Rob Bonta labeled the vote a “weaponization of the Congressional Review Act.” The duo promised a lawsuit, and Bonta hinted he’d argue that Republicans exceeded their authority by voting despite Congressional Budget Office and Senate parliamentarian rulings that the waivers weren’t subject to the CRA. That’s a legal stretch, given the CRA statute does not provide for any formal role for either CBO or the parliamentarian, while the statute also includes a provision limiting judicial review. Still, California could tie this up in court for a while.<br>The state also plans to enforce its mandate by other means. That includes doubling down on what it calls its “South Coast rule,” which targets carbon emissions from “indirect” sources like warehouses, ports and the trucks that deliver goods to and from these facilities. And watch for it to crank up pressure on the auto and equipment makers that signed “voluntary” commitments to comply with California’s rules, regardless of litigation. Newsom has shifted gears on some cultural and economic issues this year, as he debates a 2028 run, but he’s clearly not yet brave enough to buck the left’s well-funded climate wing.<br>Checking Nominations<br>Washington was historically reticent to break institutional precedent for a simple reason: self-preservation. Neither party wanted to demolish a tradition that might protect or benefit it in the future. That wisdom evaporated in the eras of Trump and Biden, and Republicans are now feeling another consequence.<br>The Senate Judiciary Committee’s ranking Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, announced he was putting a hold on Jason Reding Quinones, Trump’s nominee to be U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida - and the first of Trump’s prosecutor nominees in line for a full Senate vote. Durbin notably did not cite Quinones qualifications as a reason for his hold, but rather then-Sen. JD Vance’s 2023 decision to hold Biden nominations for attorney positions rather than allow the usual process of unanimous consent and voice votes. “As I’ve said time and time again - there cannot be one set of rules for Republicans and another set for Democrats,” Durbin said, as he warned he might put a blanket hold on all of Trump’s U.S. attorney nominees.<br>Democrats do prefer one set of rules for themselves and another for everyone else. And Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley complained that Durbin’s action was itself unprecedented: “Vance’s holds were limited to a small number of U.S. Attorney nominees in the latter half of the Biden administration. Placing a blanket hold on all U.S. Attorney nominees before the Trump administration has filled even a single one of the 93 Attorneys’ Offices would constitute an aggressive, unprecedented attack on the American criminal justice system,” said Grassley.<br>Then again, this is how precedents usually fall - a little at a time. Former Republican Leader Mitch McConnell in 2013 famously warned Democrats against getting rid of the filibuster for executive-branch nominees and lower-court judges: “You will regret this, and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think.” Republicans later used the lowered bar to quickly confirm most of Trump’s picks and killed the filibuster for Supreme Court justices. By Biden’s term, Democrats were threatening to get rid of the legislative filibuster.<br>You might think that at some point both sides would see the merit of calling a truce, but no sign of that yet.<br>By the Numbers:<br>[3] Politically sensitive cases that stumped law enforcement and have now been reopened by FBI.

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt last week signed into law a state version of Reins, which will provide the state legislature new powers to approve or disapprove agency rules that carry implementation and compliance costs of more than $1 million. Oklahoma becomes the seventh state to adopt a Reins-style law, as conservative groups push to get the reform enacted in nearly two dozen states.<br>Quote of the Week:<br>“This book is political fairy smut. . . . It relies on unnamed, anonymous sources pushing a self-serving false narrative that absolves them of any responsibility for our current national nightmare.”- Naomi Biden, granddaughter of the former president, on “Original Sin,” the new book that finally names some of those responsible for years of false narratives that Joe Biden was mentally fit.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R160" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">161</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/28/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">GIÁ GẠO (bán xỉ) TẠI NHẬT BẢN:<br>(Xuất xứ Bloomberg, đồ biểu của Barchart)<br>Trong Clips That Matter, phần ba liên quan đến giá Sushi và Gạo tại Nhật.

Because ultimately, it all comes down to money.” — Don Im, DEA and U.S. military intel veteran<br>(By Sam Cooper - The Bureau - May 28, 2025)<br>WASHINGTON — As a young DEA agent in 1990s Manhattan, Don Im stood at the fault line of a drug war few understood. Washington’s attention was fixed on Latin America - on Pablo Escobar, on Cali, on cocaine. The headlines and action were in Miami, a literal war zone with blood in the streets. But in the alleys of Chinatown, Im and his team in Division-41 were watching something else unfold: discreet meetings between Chinese businessmen and Colombian traffickers in basement parlours and storefront import offices.<br>“I was focused on the Chinese, and I had friends of mine chasing Colombian cartels that were hanging out in Chinatown where we were hanging out,” Im recalls. “It was really interesting because we were wondering why the Chinese were with Colombians?”<br>An economics graduate and lifelong learner, that question would come to shape Im’s career. Over the next three decades, he tracked the evolution of Chinese transnational crime - from Cold War heroin routes in Southeast Asia to a devastating global narcotics empire embedded in shell companies, casinos, shipping firms, and diplomatic covers.<br>In operations like the DEA’s Sleeping Giant probe - a deep U.S. government investigation into alliances between the Sinaloa Cartel and Chinese Triads that continues to unfold - Im mapped a stunningly sophisticated system in which Chinese businesses and citizens, secreting their wealth out of the Communist economy, bid on pools of underground cash worldwide, generated from fentanyl-, meth-, ketamine-, heroin-, and cocaine-fueled economies.<br>The scheme vacuums up cartel proceeds - cash brokers literally warehousing fentanyl-stained bills in diaspora shops across North America - then places those funds up for auction in encrypted WeChat channels. From there, the money is cleverly funneled into legitimate global trade, ultimately laundering value back to Chinese factories and superlabs operating in Canada and Mexico.<br>Over the course of his career, Im uncovered truths he now feels compelled to share with citizens of fentanyl-ravaged nations. Whether through strategic direction from Beijing’s central leadership or through corrupt alliances between provincial governors and Triad bosses within China’s vast regional economies, he alleges that the Chinese state knowingly facilitates the global narcotics trade - using offshore drug profits as an “ad hoc” financial reservoir. His claims, supported by testimony and evidence submitted to U.S. congressional hearings and federal investigations, offer a granular and sobering look at what he views as a deliberately state-enabled system.<br>But such a dark alliance of global narcos - linking China, Latin American cartels, and Middle Eastern threat actors - could not inundate North America with synthetic opioids and amphetamines, Im stresses, without a corresponding pattern of complicity and mutual profiteering among Western elites.<br>“There’s money out there - lots of it. And the global drug trade generates so much revenue and profit that there’s no way the Chinese government, and those corrupt leaders and businessmen, aren’t aware that there’s a global bank of illicit dollars and euros they could buy - at a discount. And what they’re ultimately buying and moving around the world isn’t essentially cash, but commodities produced in China,” Im says.<br>Im also learned early what every seasoned investigative journalist knows: follow the money. It’s the most effective way to dismantle kingpin networks - and often the most politically sensitive.<br>“My college major was economics, and when I became a DEA agent, it all clicked - this is about economics,” he recounts. “So throughout my career, I was constantly banging my head trying to convince supervisors, government officials, even people in the White House and the intelligence community: you can&#39;t separate commerce, trade, and banking from drugs, crime, and terrorism. Because ultimately, it all comes down to money. The question is how to rustle up all the egos and their authorities in the various departments and agencies to pursue these deadly predators and their facilitators.”<br>These sensitive ironies weren’t lost on Im when he testified before Congress.<br>“Bankers, lawyers, accountants and businessmen or politicians were more difficult unless they were blatantly caught,” Im recalls. “Plus, facilitators have protection from politicians and government officials.”<br>In a series of exclusive interviews with The Bureau, Im outlines what he sees as the untold heart of the global drug trade - a story not merely of cartels and kingpins, but of powerful business elites in cities like Vancouver, Singapore, and Panama. Behind them, he traces families built on generational drug wealth, with roots stretching back to Chinese provincial governors and Golden Triangle warlords - now intertwined with Western political, corporate, and legal heavyweights.<br>It’s a vast, interlocking narrative of profit and power that, according to Im and his U.S. colleagues, resembles a “reverse Opium War.” Where imperial powers once fought to force opium into China, today synthetic poisons flow outward - from Chinese chemical plants to global markets - fueling addiction, violence, and corruption on an industrial scale. And just as heroin profits once reshaped geopolitics, Im argues, so too do today’s fentanyl and meth empires - only now, amplified in scope, velocity, and death toll.<br>It’s a theory rooted in history. And for Im, it begins in a steel cabinet tucked away in a New York DEA field office. Inside, Im says, were the real files behind the infamous French Connection.<br>Those case files would eventually lead - directly and indirectly - to DEA’s Operation Tiger Trap, and to the sprawling tentacles of Asian narco networks quietly establishing footholds in Vancouver and Toronto and Mexico City.<br>One figure, Steven Law - the son of notorious Golden Triangle drug lord Lo Hsing Han - was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury for his role in what it described as “one of the largest heroin trafficking organizations in Southeast Asia.” According to those sanctions, Law “joined his father’s empire in the 1990s and has since become one of Burma’s wealthiest men.” Years later, he secured meetings at Vancouver’s port with a Conservative trade minister and officials in the government of British Columbia Premier Christy Clark.<br>Another man - identified by DEA investigators and British Columbia casino industry sources as a U.S.-designated heroin kingpin who once held governing authority in Hainan, and who is allegedly related to former Chinese President Deng Xiaoping - is now said to be living quietly in a Vancouver suburb.<br>A Drawer of Secrets: The French Connection and the Birth of Modern Narco-Empires<br>It began with a filing cabinet.<br>In the late 1990s, Don Im - then a young agent with DEA’s New York Division D-41 - was tasked with a routine assignment: updating administrative files on a group of four long-missing fugitives. It was the kind of clerical work that often falls to junior agents. But when Im slid open two drawers in a steel cabinet, he found something that would change the trajectory of his understanding of the drug war—and, arguably, of world history itself.<br>“I read through the first few folders and realized it was the French Connection case that started in the ’70s,” Im recalled, explaining with a sense of revelation that feels as vivid today as it did decades ago. “And the main guy in France? He was never really arrested in real life, unlike what you see in the movies.”<br>The file was like a magnet for Im, a voracious student. Whenever he found time, he returned to scour the densely typed memos, field reports, cable traffic, and court transcripts. The more he read, the clearer it became that he had stumbled on a classified archive - a secret chronology of the heroin trade that spanned decades, continents, warring militaries, and clashing diplomats.<br>“At first I’m like, ‘These four guys have got to be dead.’ But I kept going back. I read the entire file - two drawers of it. And it was involved with World War II, the Japanese occupation of China, the split between Ho Chi Minh and the Allied Forces, and the French against the U.S. in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.”<br>The French Connection, as most know it, was dramatized in Hollywood - a gritty story of New York cops and Corsican traffickers, heroin smuggled from Marseille into the veins of America. But what Im discovered was older, deeper, and geopolitical: a raw, unfiltered history of global narcotics, one that connected colonial France, the fall of Saigon, the rise of the CIA, and the long shadow of opium economies stretching across Asia.<br>“The more I read the case file,” Im said, “I realized how it all started way back in Indochina during World War II. The Japanese had occupied Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and so forth. And when the Japanese surrendered, there were a bunch of forces against the Japanese in Indochina. You had the Americans - OSS, the prelude to the CIA. You had the French, the Vietnamese - all fighting together against the Japanese.”<br>The Office of Strategic Services - the OSS, precursor to the CIA - initially aligned with Ho Chi Minh’s nationalist forces in their resistance to Japan.<br>“Then when the war ended,” Im continued, “the French, who had colonized Vietnam since the 1800s, wanted to stay.”<br>“Then they had a number of Japanese prisoners who were released as well, and the French hired them to fight against the Vietnamese. And ironically, the OSS - were like, ‘Hey, listen, let’s help the Vietnamese here.’”<br>France’s motives for remaining planted in Southeast Asia were simple, Im says, citing the files: opium profits.<br>“The reason the French didn’t want to leave Vietnam was because of the opium trade,” Im explained. “It was generating hundreds of millions of dollars in equivalent revenue.”<br>Amid these battles, Ho Chi Minh appealed directly to Washington.<br>“He even quoted the Declaration of Independence,” Im said. “They sent letters to Roosevelt, to Truman, asking for help convincing the French to leave.”<br>These appeals occurred in the mid-to-late 1940s, as French troops clung to control over Indochina and the U.S. began shaping Cold War alliances.<br>And the Americans actually wanted to side with Ho, according to the files cited by Im.<br>But geopolitics overruled principle.<br>“Unfortunately,” Im recalled, “the dynamics in Europe - especially Berlin - against the Soviet Union compelled the U.S. to support France. Essentially, the French were extorting the Americans, saying they wouldn’t back us in Berlin if we didn’t back them in Vietnam.”<br>That Faustian bargain, Im says, citing DEA files, would pull the United States into a long and bloody conflict in Southeast Asia. And after France’s defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, something else happened: the remnants of France’s intelligence, military, and smuggling networks returned to Marseille - and kept their narcotics pipeline intact.<br>“They went back to France. And what did they do? They kept their sources back in Vietnam to bring in opium and produce heroin for the U.S. market - because you get the large profit margin in the United States.”<br>What Im had uncovered wasn’t just a forgotten case. It was a historical blueprint for the global heroin trade - how Cold War alliances and colonial withdrawal set the stage for decades of narco-trafficking.<br>And the vacuum left by Western powers in Southeast Asia was ultimately filled by regional warlords and the Chinese Communist Party, leading to the foundation of networks that secretly dominate the world’s drug trade today - where opium and heroin have been blended and amplified by synthetic opioids.<br>“So it was really a conflict over money. And the commodity generating those profits was opium. Even the Vietnamese were also generating revenue from the opium trade. It was just a conflict over who was going to run that market. And it’s no different to this day. When the communists took over, the opium trade shifted from Vietnam to Thailand and Myanmar,” Im says.<br>“And that’s where I read a lot of the history of the various ethnic armies in southern Burma,” Im explained. “The Karen were supported by the Chinese Communist Party, but the others were backed by the Kuomintang [the Chinese Nationalist Party of Chiang Kai-shek] and the U.S. CIA. I read those folders and files, and it was just a fascinating history of global inter-dynamic posturing. And the crux of it all was money.<br>All of that led to Chinese organized crime starting to evolve and grow - in the Golden Triangle, Thailand, Burma, Hong Kong,” Im concluded. “That’s how I really came to understand the complexities of Chinese organized crime and how far back it goes. The triads were created in those rural provincial areas to protect one another, to fight rival provinces. And to this day, there are still struggles going on.”<br>The Bureau is a reader-supported publication.

These investigations revealed a convergence he hadn’t fully grasped until then: historic Golden Triangle empires joining forces with Latin American cartels, quietly expanding their global reach - into Vancouver, Toronto, Mexico City, and beyond.<br>“These current-day traffickers and money brokers - they’re all the descendants of those historic heroin traders,” Im says. “They’re the kids and grandkids, and they’re still operating in the United States, North America, Canada. They’ve spread out. I know - they’re all here.”<br>For Im, this wasn’t theoretical. It was backed by arrest records, sanction designations, and wiretaps.<br>“I mean, we were capturing and arresting all kinds of people - from Southeast Asia, Burma, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Paraguay, Canada. We were on a wiretap, on a prisoner. There was a Chinese trafficker we were tapping in New York, and he was calling back to his big brother in a Canadian prison. The big brother in the Canadian prison said, ‘Hey, don’t take any of the heroin directly into the United States anymore. Just come through Canada - because if you get caught in Canada, you only serve a third of your sentence. And life is much better here in prison, and you get out much earlier.’”<br>Launched in the mid-1990s and prosecuted in the Eastern District of New York, Tiger Trap was designed to map and dismantle international heroin trafficking routes. The investigation targeted the highest echelons of the global drug trade.<br>“It was essentially aimed at going after the main heroin suppliers coming out of Southeast Asia and bringing it into the United States - a lot of it through Canada, some through South America.”<br>Top targets included Khun Sa - real name Chang Chi Fu - and Lo Hsing Han, the longtime Golden Triangle heroin kingpin who had by then reinvented himself in Singapore.<br>“Lo Hsing Han established himself as a businessman in Singapore with heroin money,” Im says. “I helped sanction him and others in the late ’90s. His family continues to thrive from the destruction he helped unleash. They were our targets. Now their offspring are living off his global crimes.”<br>One of those offspring was Steven Law - also known by his Chinese name, Lo Ping Zhong - who resurfaced in Canada years later under diplomatic cover. According to public records and trip itineraries, Law was one of four businessmen traveling with Burma’s Minister of National Planning and Economic Development during a 2014 “ASEAN Economic Ministers Roadshow” hosted in part by the Canadian government. The delegation met with provincial and federal officials, including events in British Columbia.<br>Law did not travel under his sanctioned name, nor did he identify himself as Asia World’s executive chairman. Instead, he listed his title as managing director of an obscure mining company.<br>The trip raised immediate concerns among Burmese immigrants and human rights experts. As reported by Vancouver Province columnist Mike Smyth, Law’s presence in Canada was described as an immigration failure with geopolitical consequences - an early warning sign, in hindsight, of Washington’s growing concerns over lax Canadian borders and the emergence of the “Vancouver Model” of transnational money laundering through casinos and real estate.<br>“Canada’s immigration system failed to uphold the law when it allowed a notorious tycoon linked to drugs and dictators into the country to be wined and dined by our politicians,” Smyth wrote. “Law was part of an Asian trade delegation hosted by Abbotsford MP Ed Fast, the federal minister of international trade. The trade mission travelled to Toronto and Vancouver, where delegates met with Premier Christy Clark and B.C. cabinet minister Teresa Wat.”<br>Law and his late father had already been designated under the U.S. Treasury’s Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. “In addition to their support for the Burmese regime, Steven Law and Lo Hsing Han have a history of involvement in illicit activities,” the Treasury said in 2008.<br>Meanwhile, Tiger Trap’s top target Khun Sa’s eventual surrender in 1996 left a power vacuum that was swiftly filled by other armed narcotics groups, most notably the United Wa State Army, which continued large-scale heroin and methamphetamine production with deep ties to Chinese intelligence and border authorities. In 2005, U.S. authorities indicted eight leaders, including Wei Hsueh Kang.<br>According to DEA records and sources, another of the sanctioned kingpins - allegedly related to former Chinese President Deng Xiaoping and once wielding governing authority in Hainan - quietly settled in a Vancouver suburb in the early 2000s. While living in Canada, he continued to meet discreetly with British Columbia casino officials, according to an industry source, even as his connections to Chinese threat networks remained active.<br>Beijing’s Western Beachhead: CCP Operations Through Vancouver into the U.S.<br>For Don Im, the intelligence gathered by The Bureau - including Steven Law’s trade mission visit to the Port of Vancouver - came as no surprise. Nor did Canada’s emergence as a strategic base of operations for modern Chinese transnational drug networks. One of the most consequential figures to rise through that evolution, Im says, is Tse Chi Lop, the Canadian-Chinese kingpin based in Markham, Ontario. Tse achieved global dominance through longstanding partnerships with traffickers from the old Golden Triangle routes - and with Chinese provincial officials seeking political advancement within the Communist Party system.<br>“Chi Lap Tse and all these guys - they’re all the subsequent generation of those we were looking at in the ’80s and ’90s, with the DEA New York Field Division and Delta 41,” Im says.<br>The system by which global narco bosses like Tse - and comparable figures in Mexico, such as Zhenli Ye Gon, who was busted with $207 million in cash in his Mexico City hacienda - underwrite cartel production and distribution of both organic and synthetic drugs is still being revealed in Project Sleeping Giant, launched in 2017.<br>A key finding of the operation, according to one of Im’s U.S. government colleagues who cannot be named, was the laundering of drug proceeds through Chinese international students, who were used to inject illicit cash into North American banks.<br>“This project highlighted the role of Chinese organized crime, particularly the Triads, in supplying precursor chemicals, laundering money for cartels, and trafficking black market marijuana,” the senior official said. “Most people don’t realize that Chinese organized crime has been upstream in the drug trade for decades. Project Sleeping Giant launched numerous investigations and revealed the full scope of these networks across the Western Hemisphere.”<br>Im believes the organization of China’s political economy - spanning regional elite networks, sanctioned business dynasties, and Belt and Road-linked laundering fronts involving narcos like Tse and ambitious provincial governors - now plays a direct role in facilitating the global narcotics trade. Based on his reading of U.S. intelligence files, he views this system as intimately connected to Beijing’s geopolitical strategy.<br>The entire structure, Im says, serves Beijing’s global aims: to preserve regime survival, expand geographic spheres of influence, and avoid being encircled by Western alliances - circumstances the Chinese leadership believes led to the fall of the Soviet Union.<br>In this worldview, Vancouver was not merely a laundering hub - it was a strategic foothold, an expanding shadow footprint for Beijing operatives, who, at roughly the same time, were flooding into Latin America and Mexico.<br>“They expanded from Panama to Colombia into Mexico. I remember with DEA, we saw Chinese in Paraguay in the 1980s moving cocaine. We were wondering: why Paraguay?” Im recalls. “And there were Taiwanese triads. Those historical links from Paraguay expanded into Peru, the ports into Chile, into Colombia.”<br>“And through their strategy, I think they&#39;ve been trying to do the same thing to the United States by controlling Canada,” Im said. “After Hong Kong was reverted back to China, you saw what was essentially billions of dollars’ worth of wealth just move into Vancouver. And that became a base of operations for the Chinese Communist Party.”<br>“They’ve expanded all the way to the east - even into the United States politically - through funding, money influence, campaign operations, influence operations. And it’s the fact that our democracy and economic capitalistic society is very vulnerable to these types of influences. And the Chinese realize that.”<br>As jarring - even perhaps unbelievable - as Im’s testimony may sound to the average North American, many of whom have little concept of China’s decades-long global operations, his account is powerfully corroborated by The Bureau’s own reporting, based on confidential files authored by former Canadian immigration officer Brian McAdam.<br>In the early 1990s, working from Canada’s Hong Kong Consulate and in close coordination with U.S. intelligence and immigration services, McAdam filed a 65-page classified report titled Passports of Convenience. The document warned that Hong Kong had become the nerve center of a sprawling Chinese corruption network - one that leveraged bribery, Triad alliances, and compromised governments to orchestrate global influence-buying and covert migration.<br>McAdam’s files detailed how Chinese Communist Party officials worked with Triad organizations - notably the Sun Yee On and United Bamboo - to traffic narcotics and migrants via corrupt Latin American governments, while embedding loyalist diaspora networks across North America to suppress dissent and extend Beijing’s reach.<br>“While preparing this memo, U.S. INS just informed us that the wife of the Governor of Fujian Province is suspected to have, knowingly or unknowingly, invested in a number of Sun Yee On Triad-owned companies in Fujian,” the report’s June 1993 covering memo states.<br>“An underground community of smuggled aliens has been created in the United States which in many ways is subject to the control of Chinese criminal groups,” the report concluded, citing U.S. intelligence.<br>The findings were unambiguous: Triads had purchased influence at “the highest levels of some governments,” including entire Central American jurisdictions, to build covert entry pipelines into the United States.<br>One example cited in Canadian files was especially alarming - suggesting convergence between Triads, smuggling syndicates, and terrorism-linked passport flows. According to Passports of Convenience, Belizean Cabinet ministers were involved in selling visas to both PRC nationals and Palestinian migrants, while Triad leaders arranged chartered flights out of Belize to smuggle them into North America.<br>A 1995 U.S. State Department document echoed McAdam’s findings, quoting INS consultant Willard Meyers: “Taiwanese Triad members reportedly ‘purchased the country of Belize and its Minister for Immigration… turning Belize into an air gateway for entry of Chinese aliens into the United States.’”<br>Today, under renewed scrutiny from the Trump administration and the FBI, similar trafficking concerns - particularly involving terror suspects from high-risk states - are increasingly focused on Canada’s border, with Vancouver’s port emerging as a critical point of vulnerability.<br>According to McAdam’s personal notes, Passports of Convenience was quietly buried in Ottawa - likely, he believed, because Canadian diplomats were among those compromised by Beijing’s expanding network.<br>NEXT IN THE SERIES:<br>How the Chinese Communist Party’s Belt and Road Project Channels Narco Profits Worldwide - and the Politically Connected Facilitators Enabling Narcos in the West</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R162" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">163</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/28/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">OVER MY SHOULDER CỦA MAULDIN ECONOMICS<br>Hôm nay, Mauldin Economics giới thiệu ‘Clips That Matter’, năm chi tiết đáng chú ý sau đây:<br>https://www.mauldineconomics.com/.../clips-that-matter...<br>By John Mauldin &amp; Patrick Watson | May 28, 2025<br>Clips That Matter<br>Here’s what we clipped for you this week:<br>1/ Why the US imports so many (legal) drugs.<br>2/ Thailand and Vietnam look like the biggest tariff winners so far.<br>3/ Japan’s Rice Crisis.<br>4/ Big changes start small.<br>5/ Two companies make practically all smartphones.<br>CLIPS that MATTER - Mauldin Economics - May 28, 2025<br> Download PDF<br>Drug Deficit<br>The US total trade deficit in goods was about $1.2 trillion in 2024.

The evidence is impossible to ignore.<br>For example, recent analysis of county-level voting trends in the past three elections by Shane Goldmacher in The New York Times shows that Trump improved his standing in “1,433 of the nation&#39;s 3,100+ counties, even as he lost in 2020. Democrats have expanded their vote share continuously in only 57 counties.” Likewise, TLP’s own analysis of the gold-star Catalist data from 2024 shows how the party lost significant ground with major demographic groups from 2012 to 2024, including: black voters (22-point decline), Latinos (27-point decline), working-class voters overall (12-point decline), men (11-point decline), and young people (14-point decline).<br>The bigger question is why Democrats did nothing about these trends as they were emerging. It wasn’t a state secret.<br>TLP alone published hundreds of pieces over the past five years outlining in detail Democrats’ setbacks and travails with working-class voters of all races and how the party’s economic and cultural agenda was falling flat with Americans across the country. TLP co-founder Ruy Teixeira and contributor John Judis wrote a crystal-clear, deeply researched, highly engaging book about the decline of the historical party of America’s working class - Where Have All the Democrats Gone? - that was published an entire year before the 2024 election. As they explained at the time:<br>    For all this, over the last decades, Democrats have steadily lost the allegiance of “everyday Americans” - the working- and middle-class voters that were at the core of the older New Deal coalition. Initially, most of these lost voters were white, but in the last elections, Democrats have also begun to lose support among Latino and Asian working-class voters.<br>    How did this happen? There is an original reason, for which the Democrats were hardly to blame. Democrats were the principal supporters of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 - measures that went a long way toward ending racial segregation and Jim Crow, but that angered many southern whites and, to a lesser extent, some whites in the North.<br>    With the exception of a few far-right groups, however, Americans have reconciled themselves to those bills. Democrats regularly win elections in Virginia, the seat of the southern Confederacy, and many of the northern and southern suburbs formed by white flight now vote for Democratic candidates. And Americans elected an African American president in 2008 and reelected him in 2012.<br>    Today, there are a multitude of factors that have driven working-class voters out of the Democratic Party. They include:<br>*    Democrats’ support for trade deals that led to factory closings in many small towns and midsize cities in states that were once Democratic strongholds.<br>*    Democrats’ support for spending bills that the working and middle classes paid for but that were primarily of benefit to poor Americans, many of whom were minorities.<br>*    Democrats’ enthusiasm for immigration of unskilled workers and the party’s opposition to measures that might reduce illegal immigration.<br>*    Democrats’ support for strict gun control.<br>*    Democrats’ insistence on eliminating fossil fuels.<br>*    Democrats’ use of the courts and regulations to enforce their moral and cultural agenda, whether on the sale of wedding cakes or the use of public men’s and women’s bathrooms.<br>     Not all Democrats are in line with these actions or beliefs. But overall, they came to characterize the party. Some of these stances have to do directly with economics; others with culture. The differences over them are often taken to distinguish the college-educated professional from those who do not have college degrees, but they equally, if not more accurately, arise from the differences in economic geography - what we call the “Great Divide” in American politics.<br>    On one side of the divide are the great postindustrial metro centers like the Bay Area, Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, New York, and Seattle. These are areas that benefited from the boom in computer technology and high finance. These areas are heavily populated by college-educated professionals, but also by low-skilled immigrants who clean the buildings, mow the lawns, and take care of the children and the aged. The professionals, who set the political agenda for these areas, welcome legal and illegal immigrants; they want guns off the street; they see trade not as a threat to jobs but as a source of less expensive goods; they worry that climate change will destroy the planet; and, among the young, they are engaged in a quest for new identities and sexual lifestyles. A majority of them are Democrats.<br>    On the other side of the divide are the small towns and midsize cities that have depended on manufacturing, mining, and farming. Some of these places have prospered from newly discovered oil and gas deposits, but many are towns and cities like Muncie, Indiana; Mansfield, Ohio; and Dundalk, Maryland that have lost jobs when firms moved abroad or closed up shop in the face of foreign competition. The workers and small businesspeople in these towns and cities want the border closed to illegal immigrants, whom they see as a burden to their taxes and a threat to their jobs; they want to keep their guns as a way to protect their homes and family; they fly the American flag in front of their house; they go to or went to church; they oppose abortion; some may be leery of gay marriage, although that is changing; many of them or members of their family served in the military; they have no idea what most of the initials in LGBTQIA+ stand for. A majority of them are now Republicans and many are former working-class Democrats.<br>Why was all this political, demographic, and cultural change ignored at the time - when something could have been done about it?<br>As Ruy and John explain in their book, and I outlined in a recent TLP piece, part of it has to do with the sociology of the party itself and its capture by highly educated, culturally-left activists, policy institutions, candidates, campaign staffers, and consultants. If your party is controlled by strategists, policy wonks, and candidates who are mostly not from working-class backgrounds and don’t represent these communities, it’s not surprising that they can’t see straight about the party’s emerging troubles with these voters.<br>This raises another issue about the psychology of the ruling strata of Democrats. By early 2022, for example, there was strong evidence that Biden’s economic agenda—particularly as it related to trillions of dollars in new spending and promises for even more - plus the party’s sharp turn to the left on cultural matters was alienating key working-class voting blocs. Any clear-eyed reading of public opinion data at the time showed serious concerns among voters about inflation and a host of Democratic policies on immigration, transgender ideology, crime, and climate change.<br>Were key Democrats just negligent about all of this, meaning they didn’t bother to examine the evidence in the first place? Or were they more indifferent about it, meaning they knew what was going on with voters but downplayed it and decided not to do anything about it in terms of their policies, values, outreach, and campaigning? Most likely, leading Democrats and party staffers were engaged in a common form of groupthink, combining both negligence and indifference into a potent stew of denial about the party’s decline with black voters, Latinos, young people, and the working class - groups they had always taken for granted as bedrock supporters of the party.<br>“There’s no way ‘people of color,’ nonvoters, and blue-collar Americans will shift to Trump!” Or so they thought.<br>A key aspect of groupthink is the suppression of dissenting voices and rejection of information that doesn’t fit the group’s consensus. Members of both parties and people in a multitude of different institutions are susceptible to this particular psychological malady. After 2020, Democrats didn’t want to hear about the effects of their party’s screwy cultural program on working-class voters, so they didn’t look for it or attacked people who made these arguments as insufficiently committed to the partisan cause. Democrats also didn’t want to hear about reams of polling data and qualitative studies showing that their core campaign themes around “Bidenomics” and threats to abortion rights and democracy didn’t resonate with key voting groups that would ultimately decide the election. So, the leading party members said decline wasn’t happening or told people to yell louder about how good the economy was doing and how much of a threat Trump was to reproductive choice and democracy. Both of these approaches proved to be losing strategies, as was predicted by many party dissidents and neutral analysts at the time.<br>In addition, stunning (but perhaps not surprising) new evidence of negligence, indifference, and groupthink has emerged from recently published books and other journalistic accounts of how senior Democrats and the media missed, ignored, or shrugged off President Biden’s declining mental state in office even as his top campaign people made off with millions in fees and hid negative polling data from him.<br>People in a rut usually proclaim, “Oh the past is past, let’s move on.”<br>But if a party can’t or won’t confront its own debilitating psychological deficiencies, it will never improve. The road to recovery starts with Democrats learning how to accept and analyze the mounds of data and election results showing that large numbers of Americans no longer trust the party, don’t like many of its candidates, and disagree with much of the party’s recent economic and cultural agenda. Donald Trump figured out how to exploit these weaknesses, even with his own manifest problems accepting reality.<br>Democratic Party elites and candidates made crucial mistakes and failed to change course as these negative trends among voters were solidifying over the past decade. Going forward, they cannot afford to continue putting their heads in the sand about the party’s predicament - or else Democrats should prepare themselves for at least eight years of Trump-then-Vance presidencies and continued rejection at the polls.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R164" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">165</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/28/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">GIÁO SƯ JONATHAN TURLEY LẠI CHƠI CHỮ!<br>Phân tách mâu thuẫn giữa Tổng thống Donald Trump và Đại học Harvard (thuộc loại cổ kính ưu tú được gọi là trường Ivy Leagues) giáo sư Turley cho rằng Chính quyền Trump có lý và sẽ thắng - mà còn chơi chữ, với Poison Ivy là loại dây leo gây dị ứng!

For Harvard, this could prove a case of winning battles and losing a war of attrition.<br>Here is the column:<br>Eighty-one years ago, on May 31, 1944, General George Patton walked before the 6th Armored Division before the D-Day invasion and told the troops a simple, inescapable fact about war: “No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.”<br>It is a cautionary speech that might well be given in Harvard Square this week as the fight between the university and the Trump administration escalates. By the end of this war (regardless of the outcome), the Trump administration is likely to win even if it loses in the courts.<br>The Trump administration has committed to total war with Harvard on multiple fronts. It is threatening the school’s tax-exempt status, denying the ability to admit foreign students, freezing grants, and launching a myriad of investigations.<br>Harvard has responded with its largest deployment since the “Harvard Regiment” left for the Civil War. (It is worth noting that the famed 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry suffered one of the highest casualty rates of any unit in the Union Army).<br>For the record, I have previously criticized the administration for some of these actions, including the attack on the school’s tax-exempt status, the wholesale freezing of grants, and the blocking of foreign students. These measures undermine both free speech and academic freedom in higher education.<br>Nevertheless, the Trump administration will prevail in some actions, particularly in the allocation of discretionary grants.<br>Harvard’s own recent study found that it created an unsafe environment for Jewish students.  Harvard also has a documented history of racial discrimination that led to a major Supreme Court ruling a couple of years ago against the use of race in college admissions.<br>The administration is claiming that Harvard failed to turn over information to regulators on foreign students and has not fully addressed the antisemitism on campus.<br>Harvard has compelling arguments to make regarding due process and procedural protections.<br>However, in the end, this is a war of attrition that Harvard will lose.<br>President Donald Trump has already framed this fight in a way that is politically and financially lethal for Harvard. (In the interest of full disclosure, I have a son studying at Harvard Law School).<br>This week, Trump suggested that his administration may redirect billions from Harvard to trade schools.<br>His targeting of foreign students also shows an understanding of the soft underbelly of higher education. Foreign students are the meal ticket for universities. They generally pay full tuition, allowing universities to fund scholarships for other students. Over 27 percent of Harvard’s class is composed of foreign students.<br>Cutting off both grants and foreign enrollments is a devastating one-two punch, even for a school with Harvard’s massive endowment.<br>Even if these measures are ultimately rejected in the courts, many researchers and foreign students will view Harvard as a risky choice in the years to come.<br>More importantly, Harvard can hardly expect much support from the public after years of open hostility toward those who espouse conflicting viewpoints.<br>As I discuss in my book “The Indispensable Right,” Harvard is not just an academic echo chamber. It is a virtual academic sensory deprivation tank.<br>In a country with a majority of conservative and libertarian voters, fewer than 9 percent of the Harvard student body and less than 3 percent of the faculty members identify as conservative.<br>For years, Harvard faculty have brushed away complaints over its liberal orthodoxy, including purging conservative faculty. It has created one of the most hostile schools for free speech in the nation, ranking dead last among universities in annual studies by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE).<br>Only a third of students at Harvard feel comfortable speaking on campus despite being overwhelmingly liberal at an overwhelmingly liberal institution. (The percentage is much higher for the small number of conservative students).<br>Not long ago, I had a debate at Harvard Law School with Professor Randall Kennedy on the lack of ideological diversity at the school. I respect Kennedy and I do not view him as anti-free speech or intolerant. Yet when I noted the statistics on the vanishing number of conservative students and faculty in comparison to the nation, Kennedy responded that Harvard “is an elite university” and does not have to “look like America.”<br>The problem is that Harvard does not even look like Massachusetts, which is nearly 30 percent Republican.<br>The question is whether America will now support Harvard.<br>The school hopes that the public will rush to its side in this fight in the name of intellectual diversity.<br>Trump knows that this comes down to the numbers. <br>At the height of the Civil War, General (and future President) Ulysses S. Grant declared “I intend to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.” Grant knew that he had a greater ability to absorb casualties, whereas even in successful battles, Lee was being drained of men and material.<br>Trump is clearly willing to fight this out if “it takes all summer” and indeed would be happy to do so if it takes his whole term.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R165" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">166</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/27/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">QUÂN SƯ CỦA DONALD TRUMP:<br>Trên The Free Press, Eli Lake giới thiệu khuôn mặt cũ mà mới, và ít ai biết tới, Michael Anton.<br>https://www.thefp.com/.../magas-machiavelli-the-quiet...<br>MAGA’s Machiavelli: The Quiet Rise of Michael Anton<br>“Michael Anton saw where American politics was headed before almost anyone else,” writes Eli Lake.

It seems that wherever Trump’s highest stakes diplomacy is taking place, one will find Anton.<br>His name is not known to most people outside of Washington, but inside the Trump administration Anton has emerged as one of the most important intellectuals behind the president’s foreign policy revolution. In an administration beset with, at times, bitter ideological divides and an often chaotic style that has shocked both allies and foes, Anton has risen to the top by playing his cards close to his chest and deftly navigating the right’s warring foreign policy camps.<br>Anton has accompanied Secretary of State Marco Rubio on all but one of his overseas trips. He has been a key negotiator on U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff’s team to forge a Ukraine-Russia ceasefire. And last month, he was tapped to lead the technical talks with Iran over a possible new nuclear deal - a key role for any potential agreement that relies so much on devilish details.<br>Anton’s importance to the Trump administration was signaled early by the president himself. When he was appointed to be the director of the Policy Planning Staff at the State Department, Trump took the unprecedented step of announcing the news personally, a job normally left for the incoming secretary of state. “Michael served me loyally and effectively at the National Security Council in my First Term,” Trump posted on Truth Social on December 8. “He spent the last eight years explaining what an America First foreign policy truly means.”<br>In an administration that often resembles the court of a European monarch, where even cabinet secretaries don’t know where they stand, Trump’s post sent a powerful signal.<br>That Anton would emerge as such a trusted figure in Trump’s America First movement would be a surprise to anyone who knew Anton before 2016 - that is, before his viral, pseudonymous “Flight 93 Election” essay, and before Trump shocked the world with his election victory.<br>Back then, while now-Vice President J.D. Vance was warning that Trump was “cultural heroin,” Anton was insisting that he might be the only man who could save the republic from the rot and ruin of the left’s march through our institutions. “Trump, alone among candidates for high office in this or in the last seven (at least) cycles, has stood up to say: I want to live,” Anton wrote. “I want my party to live. I want my country to live. I want my people to live. I want to end the insanity.”<br>With a mix of provocative broadsides in the media and unglamorous behind-the-scenes work in government, Anton has charted an improbable path, from the heart of the neoconservative establishment to the core of the new MAGA foreign policy establishment. Over a decade in which the American right has been defined by bad-tempered, friendship-ending fights, Anton, a Machiavelli scholar, hasn’t just survived the America First revolution, he has helped to shape it.<br>As Anton’s star has risen in Washington, I spoke with a dozen of his friends, ex-friends, and colleagues, and with D.C. insiders, to understand how a man who once wrote speeches for former president George W. Bush and former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and contributed pieces to the now-defunct neoconservative Weekly Standard came to be the nation’s chief explainer of Trump’s foreign policy.<br>Born in northern California, Michael Anton spent most of his career inside a Republican establishment that is now a smoldering ruin. He was a mid-level staffer on strategic communications for Bush’s National Security Council (NSC). He was part of the administration that invaded Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11. He was, in other words, the very kind of Republican the Trump movement has largely exiled.<br>Elliott Abrams, who worked with Anton in the Bush administration and also served Trump in his first term, said Anton is “a principled person, and he is not going to do anything in this job or any other that he doesn’t believe in.”<br>Before working for Bush, Anton was with Rudy Giuliani, at the time the pro-choice mayor of New York. Anton was also an adviser on Giuliani’s 2008 presidential campaign; he wrote speeches for Rupert Murdoch.<br>In addition to all of that, he is a classically trained chef with a weakness for esoteric interpretations of ancient texts and a love of good tailoring. He has written a book (under the pseudonym Nicholas Antongiavanni), The Suit, imagining how Niccolò Machiavelli would advise young professionals to dress for the office. (Chapter titles include “Of Those Things for Which Men and Especially Dandies Are Praised or Blamed” and “How Men of Superfluous Girth May Minimize Their Appearance.”)<br>“Michael Anton is a classically trained chef with a weakness for esoteric interpretations of ancient texts and a love of good tailoring,” writes Eli Lake. (Doug Mills/The New York Times/Redux)<br>John Avlon, who worked with Anton on Giuliani’s 2008 presidential campaign and is now a Democrat who ran for Congress on Long Island at the last election, told The Free Press that Anton “would occasionally come into the office, as I recall, always in his three-piece suits. He is obviously smart. He had a self-effacing sense of humor, when it was deployed. He was basically a team player. But he wasn’t remotely a man-of-the-people kind of guy.” Avlon added, “Anton was a conventional movement conservative in the George W. Bush era, albeit with a Straussian background,” a reference to the political philosopher and Plato translator Leo Strauss.<br>A look back at Anton’s contributions to the Weekly Standard makes the point. In 2011, for example, Anton argued that former president Barack Obama’s intelligence community was playing games with its estimates on Iran’s missile program. The same year, Anton defended Dick Cheney against Bob Woodward’s criticism of the former vice president for being the only member of the Bush cabinet to support an Israeli strike on a Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007. Today, the Cheneys are heretics inside the MAGA movement because of Liz Cheney’s Congressional inquiry into the January 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol.<br>Anton - who declined to be interviewed for this profile - is, in the best sense and by his own admission, a reactionary. He experienced as an undergrad in the late 1980s the campus culture of Berkeley and sprinted in the other direction. “Despite having grown up with hippies all around me, and having attended my fair share of Cal games, I really had no idea what Berkeley was going to be like,” he wrote in 2014 for the Claremont Review of Books. “It took about six weeks for me to realize, ‘These people are nuts!’ I am thus a reactionary in the strict sense: My politics were formed, at least initially, in opposition to that madness.”<br>Those words were gleaned from an essay Anton wrote in appreciation of his late academic mentor, Harry Jaffa, a legendary political theorist whose scholarship on Abraham Lincoln and the founding fathers has informed generations of conservatives. Jaffa revered Lincoln for his courage and will to do what is necessary to preserve the union and the republican American experiment.<br>To Anton’s ex-friends in the conservative movement, he has betrayed this tradition by aligning himself to a president who has not conceded his loss in the 2020 election. But Anton broke with that old establishment long ago.<br>And he did so with an essay that exploded like a nuclear bomb in D.C.<br>When Anton sat down to write “The Flight 93 Election” nearly a decade ago, he had jumped from politics to finance, working as a managing director at BlackRock, the global investment firm that today is the bête noire for MAGA populists. In other words, he had become the epitome of the establishment he was about to pillory.<br>Anton’s argument in the essay could hardly have been more provocative. He wrote that a third consecutive Democratic presidency would leave the republic in shambles. This was a break-glass moment. As the title of the essay telegraphs, conservatives had an obligation in 2016 to storm the cockpit to prevent the calamity of hijackers crashing it into the White House.<br>“A Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian Roulette with a semi-auto,” read the essay. “With Trump, at least you can spin the cylinder and take your chances.”<br>The villains are not only the Democrats. He also rails against “Conservativism, Inc.,” which he compares to the Washington Generals, the basketball team paid to lose to the Harlem Globetrotters. He blasts the “Davoisie,” a portmanteau for the head-in-the-clouds elites that dream up “inanities like 32 ‘genders,’ elective bathrooms, single-payer, Iran sycophancy, ‘Islamophobia,’ and Black Lives Matter.”<br>The Claremont Review of Books published “Flight 93” on its website on September 5, 2016. A version was submitted to the journal in January of 2015 that made the case for Trump before any of the Republican primaries. It was rejected at first because the board of the Claremont Review was divided on Trump. No one expected the essay to cause major waves. But it was a sensation. On September 7, 2016, Rush Limbaugh read the entire thing on his syndicated radio show, hailing it as the best argument against the burgeoning Never Trump movement at the time.<br>Ryan Williams, the president of the Claremont Institute and publisher of the Claremont Review of Books, told me Rush’s endorsement ended up crashing their website.<br>Adding to the intrigue surrounding the essay was that no one knew who wrote it. The article that was all anyone could talk about was written under a pseudonym: Publius Decius Mus.<br>Anton’s choice of pen name is revealing. Publius Decius Mus is not a reference to the Publius of The Federalist Papers, the pen names of Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. This Publius refers to three generations of Roman leaders, two of whom sacrificed their lives during the Samnite Wars to save the republic.<br>An establishment Republican who had a cushy job in finance, Anton had a lot to lose and little to gain from writing the piece. “If you look at the world in which Mike was working, the New York corporate world and the social circles Mike was in, that essay was a huge risk, including most importantly to his ability to feed and clothe his family,” Williams told The Free Press in an interview.<br>In September 2016, Trump was widely considered a vulgarian loser. One has to remember that Ted Cruz, the last Republican standing in the primary against Trump that year, refused to endorse him at the party’s convention. Dozens of Republican policymakers signed a “never Trump” pledge in 2016. Even J.D. Vance was against Trump in the fall of 2016. When “Flight 93” was published, Hillary Clinton looked like she was headed to a landslide victory. The smart money was not on Trump.<br>Williams said that when Anton wrote the “Flight 93” essay he had no assurances from the Trump campaign that they would give him a job if they won. “Given what we know about the corporate culture and ideological commitments of BlackRock,” he said, “it was easy to predict that had he written it under his own name, they would have terminated him.”<br>Anton’s secret was safe until February 3, 2017. That’s when journalist Michael Warren blew his cover in a scoop for The Weekly Standard. By this time, Anton was back at the National Security Council as the deputy assistant to the president for strategic communications. He was still waiting for his last bonus from BlackRock when the news hit.<br>“Over a decade in which the right has been defined by bad-tempered, friendship-ending fights, Anton hasn’t just survived the America First revolution, he has helped to shape it,” writes Eli Lake. (Carolyn Kaster via AP Photo)<br>In Washington, Anton became a target. For the Beltway establishment, now in the throes of the Russiagate moral panic, the unveiling of Publius was another piece of evidence that Trump was indeed a Mussolini-in-waiting. Jonathan Chait, writing in New York magazine, wrote that Anton’s essay had helped provide the intellectual gloss for the “right-wing case against democracy.” Bill Kristol, the founding editor of The Weekly Standard and now editor of The Bulwark, compared Anton to Carl Schmitt, the political theorist who enthusiastically supported the Nazis and allowed his obsession with power to warp his obligation to the truth as an intellectual.<br>Anton, of course, is not Schmitt, and he has not made the “right-wing case against democracy.” But he has also declined to endorse the outcome of the 2020 election. When pressed about it by Andrew Sullivan in a 2021 interview on Sullivan’s podcast, Anton said, “We may never know the outcome.”<br>“The Flight 93 Election” will turn nine this year, and it is evidently a point of pride for Anton: His official biography page for the State Department says Anton “is perhaps best known as the author of ‘The Flight 93 Election,’ the 2016 viral essay that galvanized many to support then-candidate Trump.”<br>In this decade-old mini-scandal around the essay and its author, one finds the roots of a problem that plagues the country today. Yes, the “Flight 93” essay in 2016 read to many (including me) like apocalyptic hyperbole. It was an extreme analysis that justified the violation of political norms to stop an existential threat. But in Chait’s and Kristol’s responses to “Flight 93,” one finds a similar apocalyptic hyperbole. Comparing Anton to Schmitt is another way of saying the elected president is Hitler.<br>In 2025, after the FBI’s meritless investigation into the Trump campaign’s phantom collusion with Russia, the purges and cancellations of the George Floyd summer, and the reckless federal and state prosecutions of Trump, even after he was his party’s nominee for 2024, the “Flight 93” essay seems less extreme—almost prescient. Today, both parties accept their own version of Anton’s apocalyptic logic.<br>In other words, Michael Anton saw where American politics was headed before almost anyone else. And for that he has been rewarded with the trust of a grateful and capricious president. That in and of itself is a remarkable feat. When Anton wrote “Flight 93,” he didn’t know Trump and had no offers for a future job in his administration. But he wrote his way into a job, and ended up serving as the director of strategic communications for the National Security Council for the first two years of Trump’s first presidency.<br>By 2024, Anton’s influence had only grown, and after the election he played a crucial role during the presidential transition. While Trump personally interviewed his future cabinet secretaries and other consiglieri like Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson weighed in on big-ticket positions, Anton was a key gatekeeper. He interviewed almost all of the subcabinet national security officials at the campaign headquarters in West Palm Beach, Florida, according to three administration officials. He wrote a binder-length memo detailing how the second Trump administration should organize the National Security Council.<br>During the transition, Anton was originally offered the job of deputy national security adviser, but turned it down because he would not work with Sebastian Gorka, the current chief of counterterrorism on the NSC staff. Gorka and Anton have a long-running feud from the first Trump administration over whether the former is owed credit for drafting Trump’s 2017 UN speech, which was one of the first articulations of Trump’s nationalist foreign policy. (Anton explained in a 2023 piece for The American Mind that he was instructed by his superiors at the White House to deny Gorka’s authorship in the press.)<br>After Anton politely declined the deputy national security adviser slot, Trump’s inner circle scrambled to make room for him at the State Department, one administration official told me.<br>Anton was offered the job of director of the Office of Policy Planning at the State Department. The title might not mean much to outsiders, but it’s an influential and storied posting, heading an in-house think tank created for the legendary Cold War strategist George F. Kennan.<br>Kennan’s old office has lost some luster in recent decades. Recent directors have spun their wheels analyzing long-term trends in geopolitics as the State Department’s higher-ups made actual foreign policy. For Anton though, the job has been a perch of significant influence. As one senior State Department official told me, “Michael Anton has been laying the groundwork for the moment we find ourselves in today. He has a very earnest, head down, do your work, don’t-seek-the-limelight approach. He understands his job is to implement the president’s policies, not his own.”<br>Anton himself is a student of Kennan, who authored the “Long Telegram,” a memo that detailed how to deter Soviet expansion in Europe while not wasting resources on liberating the captive nations Joseph Stalin swallowed up after the Allied victory in World War II. This strategy, known as containment, set the parameters for U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War. Containment begat many of the institutions that populists today consider relics of a bygone era, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.<br>And yet Anton sees Kennan as a proto-populist. In a thorough and at times acerbic 2022 essay for the Claremont Review of Books, Anton resurrects the second half of Kennan’s career, where he was not the clear-eyed hawk that today’s interventionists imagine. Rather, Kennan was someone with views about the inevitability of Russia’s domination of Ukraine very similar to today’s “restrainers.” Anton wrote that Kennan “rejected in advance the Western policies that helped lead to the present war and he would almost certainly oppose the Western aid that keeps it going. If his track record is any guide, he would - as ever - advocate peace talks.” In this respect, Anton sees Kennan as someone who “shared more opinions with today’s populist right than with the contemporary left.” And someone who would support the administration’s current approach of negotiating with America’s authoritarian foes.<br>Insights like that make Anton’s foreign policy difficult to pin down. He is neither a “restrainer” nor a “primacist.” Some of his friends have called him a Jacksonian, meaning that he supports a strong role for the U.S. military in the western hemisphere and respects the interests of other great powers.<br>Anton’s friend David Reaboi, a Republican national security analyst, told The Free Press that Anton defies traditional labels in U.S. foreign policy because “his ideas have been shaped by witnessing America’s ideology-driven overreach in the last few decades—but also by the awareness that, regardless of these policy mistakes, the U.S. has real enemies and strategic interests to manage globally.”<br>In a 2019 piece for Foreign Policy magazine, Anton defined the Trump doctrine as a foreign policy rooted in the idea that nations should pursue their national interests instead of sublimating them to idealistic distractions, such as building democracies abroad or opening borders to endless immigration. “In declining to act in their interests, Western and democratic countries create opportunities for unfriendly powers, unashamed to act in their interests, to exploit what they see as Western naivete,” he wrote. Another way to state this, Anton wrote, was as Trump himself has said: “Don’t be a chump.”<br>But the national interest is in the eye of the beholder. It is not preordained or self-evident. On the specifics, Anton is hard to pin down. However, there are clues to his thinking. In 2021, he wrote a lengthy historical analysis for The Federalist that argues the Chinese want Taiwan far more than America wants it to remain independent. “The best thing for Taiwan and the United States is the preservation of the status quo for as long as possible,” Anton wrote. “But there is no core American national interest that would compel us to go to war over Taiwan.”<br>One might think then that Anton would oppose going to war with Iran to prevent it from going nuclear. But his views on this important subject are ambiguous. He played a key role in his stint in the first Trump administration’s National Security Council, laying the groundwork for the U.S. withdrawal from Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. In his “Flight 93” essay, Anton bemoaned “Iran sycophancy” as one of the many inanities favored by the Democratic Party that real conservatives had an obligation to try to stop.<br>All of that said, the key to Anton’s rise is that he has proven himself to be a kind of political samurai. He is first and foremost loyal to his principal and by extension, his ultimate boss, Donald Trump. “He doesn’t want to graft his own particular policies on the president,” Reaboi told The Free Press. “He is not setting out to undermine the president and that is why it is hard to classify him using the normal, quick and dirty hawks-and-doves lens.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R166" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">167</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/27/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">‘THE ART OF THE DEAL’: <br>HÃY GIÚP NGƯỜI ĐIÊN HỌC KINH TẾ SỬ<br>trước khi lâm trận! Một bài mà ban tham mưu của giáo chủ củ bựa nên đọc để khuyên nhau khỏi làm trò hề!<br>https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/tariffs-in-american.../...<br>May 2025 | Volume 54, Issue 5<br>Tariffs in American History<br>By John Steele Gordon, Author, An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power<br>The following is adapted from a lecture delivered in Washington, D.C., on May 6, 2025, as part of the AWC Family Foundation Lecture Series. Sponsored by Hillsdale College’s Allan P. Kirby, Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship, which is undergoing extensive expansion and renovation, the lecture was delivered in The Heritage Foundation’s Van Andel–Gaby Center.<br>Tariffs are among the oldest of taxes for the simple reason that they are easy to collect. Just send in the tax collectors and don’t let the goods being transported move until the duty has been paid. Being one of the earliest forms of taxation, it is not surprising that tariffs produced one of the earliest forms of tax evasion: smuggling.<br>In America’s colonial period, the east coast of the United States, with its many rivers and inlets that the small ships of those days could utilize, lent itself to smuggling, and the American colonists evaded British tariffs on a grand scale.<br>Indeed, Rhode Island, with its long coastline relative to the area and its many small harbors, was the epicenter of colonial smuggling, and it opposed any attempts to suppress it. Rhode Island was the first colony to foreswear allegiance to Great Britain, on May 4, 1776, two months before the Declaration of Independence. It was also the only state not to send delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, fearing that a stronger federal government, empowered to tax, would suppress smuggling. And it was the last state to ratify the Constitution, on May 29, 1790, more than a year after the federal government had come into existence. It did so then only under the threat of having its exports taxed as if from a foreign nation.<br>When the Constitution took effect in 1789, the first order of business was to straighten out the nation’s disastrous financial situation. That is why the new State Department started out with only five employees while the Treasury Department had 40.<br>When Alexander Hamilton became the nation’s first Secretary of the Treasury, he immediately began to prepare a schedule of tariffs, along with excise taxes on such commodities as alcohol and tobacco. The Constitution forbids taxing the exports of any state, and so American tariffs have always been laid only on imports.<br>Collectors were named for each port, and these were considered plum jobs because the collector got to keep the money, earning interest on it, until it was forwarded to the federal government a few times a year.<br>Hamilton’s tariffs, along with the refunding of the national debt and the establishment of a central bank, transformed the American financial situation. By the end of the 1790s, the U.S. had the best credit rating in Europe, its bonds selling over par. By 1800, federal revenues, a mere $3.7 million in 1792, had nearly tripled to $10.8 million. About 90 percent of that revenue came from tariffs—a ratio that wouldn’t change much, except during the Civil War, for more than a century.<br>***<br>Hamilton’s tariffs had been solely for the purpose of raising revenue. But, of course, there is another use to which tariffs can be put: the protection of domestic industries from foreign competition.<br>In 1789, except for shipbuilding, there had been little American industry to protect. At his first inauguration, George Washington had been symbolically careful to wear a suit made of cloth woven in the U.S. rather than from cloth imported from Britain, as almost all high-quality cloth was at that time.<br>Britain was where the industrial spinning and weaving technology was, and Britain was determined to keep it there. Textile machinery, as well as plans for it, could not be exported - and those with expertise in the industry were not allowed to emigrate. This problem (when seen from an American viewpoint) was solved through industrial espionage. Samuel Slater, who had apprenticed in the cloth industry and had a marked talent for mechanics, carefully memorized the needed plans for spinning and weaving machinery and sailed to America, having listed himself as a farmhand on the ship’s manifest.<br>Within a year, using capital from Rhode Island’s Brown family (for whom Brown University is named), Slater had a spinning mill in operation. The American Industrial Revolution had begun - and with it a push for protective tariffs.<br>New England, with its many clear-running streams and rivers to provide waterpower, soon had a flourishing spinning industry, whereas the weaving of cloth was still initially done at home. But in 1814, Francis Cabot Lowell built a factory that would merge spinning and weaving into the first fully integrated cloth mill in the world.<br>The Embargo Act of 1807 and the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 had disrupted the importation of British cloth, and the War of 1812 had ended it. With a near monopoly in the American market, New England’s nascent textile industry flourished. But the end of the war with Britain in 1814 brought renewed British competition and even the dumping of cheap British cloth in the American market. To protect their profits, New England cloth manufacturers, led by Lowell, went to Washington and lobbied for a protective tariff.<br>Protective tariffs have a surface plausibility, especially where new industries are just getting on their feet and are not yet as efficient as older foreign ones. But tariffs, as noted, are taxes, which are largely paid by domestic consumers, not foreign manufacturers. They also often allow domestic manufacturers to raise their own prices. Regardless, Lowell and his fellow manufacturers got Congress to impose a 25-cent-per-yard tariff on British cotton cloth.<br>By the 1820s, American manufacturing, hardly existent in 1789 when the Constitution had come into effect, was growing at enormous speed. In 1824 there were two million people employed in manufacturing, ten times the number of only five years earlier. But almost all that manufacturing was taking place in Northern states. The South, wedded to the fantastic profits generated by cotton production after the invention of the cotton gin, remained almost wholly agricultural.<br>So Northern voters increasingly wanted a high tariff to protect their industries and their jobs, and Southern voters wanted a low tariff to reduce the prices they had to pay for manufactured goods. This sectional dispute led to the first existential threat to the Union.<br>***<br>The national debt had tripled during the War of 1812, after which surpluses from tariffs were used to pay it back down. Indeed, with its fast-rising industrial sector, the Northern states wanted even higher tariffs on industrial goods.<br>In 1828, as a new tariff bill was moving through Congress, Southern politicians thought they had a way to defeat it. While New England’s vast textile industry wanted high tariffs on industrial goods such as cloth, it needed to import such raw materials as wool, flax for making linen, and hemp for making rope for its shipbuilding industry. Southern congressmen inserted high tariffs of 45 percent on these commodities into the bill hoping to split off enough New England congressmen to defeat it. Their attempt failed, the tariff bill passed, and President John Quincy Adams signed it into law even though he knew it would hurt him politically. The South, ever an exporter of snappy political phrases, dubbed it the “Tariff of Abominations,” as it has been known ever since.<br>Adams was, indeed, defeated in his re-election bid by Andrew Jackson. But Jackson, while a Southerner himself, was determined to pay off the national debt and was willing to tolerate a high tariff in order to do so. Not so his vice president, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, who was adamantly opposed to the tariff of 1828. After its passage, Calhoun anonymously wrote a pamphlet asserting the right of states to nullify federal laws that they regarded as unconstitutional.<br>In November of 1832, after the tariff bill of that year did not lower tariffs enough to suit Southern demands - tariffs on specific industrial products were lowered from 45 to 35 percent, but others remained the same - the South Carolina legislature passed an Ordinance of Nullification, declaring the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 to be null and void within the borders of the state.<br>President Jackson would have none of that. Not given to mincing words, he wrote: “I consider... the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.”<br>Jackson threatened military action if necessary to enforce federal law and was authorized by Congress to use it. Only the Compromise Tariff of 1833, in which duties were to be reduced over ten years to the levels of 1816, brought the crisis to an end, with South Carolina repealing its Ordinance of Nullification.<br>With American industry becoming ever more efficient - thanks in no small part to the country’s secret weapon, Yankee ingenuity - tariff protection became less necessary, and tariffs generally trended downwards until the coming of the Civil War.<br>***<br>With the outbreak of war in 1861, government expenses exploded. Prior to the firing on Fort Sumter, the federal government had been spending about $172,000 a day. By the Battle of Bull Run three months later, the War Department alone was spending $1 million a day. While much of the cost of the war could be thrown onto the future by selling bonds, taxes - including tariffs - rose sharply as well. There were also new taxes, such as the country’s first income tax and a stamp tax on legal documents.<br>The combination of wartime demand and high tariffs produced an enormous boom in American industry as new domestic production replaced foreign imports. After the war, this new industry demanded protection against foreign competition, while the South, always opposed to high tariffs, was politically prostrate.<br>Also there was the need to pay off the colossal debt incurred during the war. With wartime tariffs still largely in place, the federal government ran 28 straight surpluses between 1866 and 1894, despite a serious depression from 1873 to 1879. The debt in dollar terms was cut by more than half between 1866 and 1900, and as a percentage of the fast-rising GDP it fell by far more.<br>But tariffs are a consumption tax and therefore fall hardest on the poor, who must spend all their income to buy necessities. So there was increasing political pressure for an income tax on the rich that would finance a lowering of tariffs. But in 1895, the Supreme Court ruled such a tax unconstitutional. Meanwhile tariffs trended down only slightly.<br>In 1899, a legal dispute between Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie caused the enormous profits of the privately held Carnegie Steel Company to become public. By then, Carnegie Steel was manufacturing so efficiently that the company was successfully exporting to both Great Britain and Germany, where the steel industry had been born. With the facts in the open, the excuse that American industry needed protection from more efficient European companies began to collapse. As a result, tariffs began to decline significantly. Average tariffs, above 50 percent in 1900, were under 20 percent by 1920.<br>***<br>Although American industry flourished in the 1920s, the agricultural sector of the economy did not. American farming had been hugely profitable during World War I, thanks to a steep decline in European production as farmhands went to war, as well as to the Ottoman Empire’s blockade of Russia’s wheat exports, which had been the largest in the world in 1913. Peace brought that agricultural prosperity to a rapid halt, and drought in the American Midwest made matters worse. Rural banks began to fail at an average rate of 500 per year during the ’20s. Worse still, the rapid spread of the automobile and the tractor caused more and more land that had been devoted to fodder crops—about one-third of the total land under cultivation in 1900—to be used to produce food for humans instead, driving down prices sharply.<br>In 1928, presidential candidate Herbert Hoover promised farmers a protective tariff on farm products. But by the time Hoover became president and the bill was considered in Congress, the Wall Street crash had happened and the economy was moving into recession. What resulted was a feeding-frenzy of special interests. Industries and whole economic sectors alike sought protection in the slowing economy and Congress obliged. Even tombstone makers got a protective tariff.<br>The result, called the Smoot-Hawley Tariff after its principal sponsors in the Senate and House, was to raise the tariff on 20,000 imported commodities. It was the highest tariff in American history.<br>Economists were appalled and more than a thousand signed a petition asking Hoover to veto the bill. Thomas Lamont, a senior partner at J.P. Morgan and Company, wrote: “I almost went down on my knees to beg Herbert Hoover to veto the asinine Hawley-Smoot Tariff. That Act intensified nationalism all over the world.”<br>Lamont was right. Foreign countries quickly built their own tariff walls to unprecedented heights and world trade collapsed. In 1929, it had amounted to about $36 billion. By 1932, global trade was only $12 billion, one-third as much. American exports had been $5.241 billion in 1929. Three years later they were down to $1.161 billion, a 78 percent drop. In constant dollar terms, American exports were lower than they had been in 1896 when the economy had been one-fifth the size.<br>Congress’s Smoot-Hawley Tariff, the Federal Reserve’s keeping interest rates high in order to protect the gold standard, and the Hoover administration’s attempt to balance the budget in 1932 with sharply higher taxes, were the three huge public-policy mistakes that converted an ordinary stock market crash and recession into the Great Depression.<br>***<br>In World War II, the industrial bases of Germany and Japan were flattened and those of the other great powers, except for the U.S., were severely impacted. In a rare example in the history of foreign policy of enlightened self-interest, rebuilding their economies was a major priority for the U.S. The intention was to restore prosperity in these devastated countries and thus to make them less susceptible to the Soviet aggression that had already taken much of Eastern Europe.<br>Reviving world trade was an important component of that. In 1947, 23 countries met in Geneva, Switzerland, and they established the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Recognizing how counterproductive the beggar-thy-neighbor trade policies of the 1930s had been, the preamble called for a “substantial reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers and the elimination of preferences, on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis.” The “other trade barriers” included quotas, import and export licenses, domestic tax reductions on exports, and direct subsidies.<br>In the first round of GATT negotiations, 45,000 tariffs were reduced, affecting about $10 billion in annual world trade. Further rounds, eight in all - the latest is still ongoing - followed as more and more countries joined GATT. Each round saw further reductions in tariffs and trade barriers.<br>In 1995, GATT evolved into the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 1999, Communist China, which had seen explosive economic growth since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, was admitted to the WTO. It was hoped that by being allowed to join the club, China would follow the rules. It has not. It has been guilty of massive theft of intellectual property as well as other nefarious trade policies as it made exports the centerpiece of its economy.<br>GATT was arguably the most successful diplomatic effort in world history. As noted, in 1932, global trade had amounted to $12 billion. By 2023 it had grown to $23 trillion. In other words, global trade, in constant dollars, has multiplied more than 80 times in 80 years.<br>To see an example of how much this has changed the world, look at the labels on your clothes. In 1947, they would mostly have been made in Manhattan’s Garment District and in other such centers of the American clothing industry. Today they are made in such places as Bangladesh, Nicaragua, and Cambodia. These countries have a large comparative advantage in clothing manufacturing - which is labor intensive but not capital intensive - thanks to their very low semi-skilled labor costs. And while the wages of these countries are very low compared with American wages even today, they are a lot more than what these people were earning two generations ago. In 1950, according to the World Bank, 62.12 percent of the world’s population was living in extreme poverty. In 2017, the percentage had fallen to 9.18 percent.<br>Never in human history has poverty fallen so far so fast. No small part of that triumph has been the lowering of trade barriers, first and foremost tariffs.<br>To be sure, not all of this enormous increase in world trade is due to GATT. One of the most important, if perhaps least exciting, inventions of the 20th century was the shipping container. It not only greatly reduced turnaround times because ships could be loaded and unloaded much more quickly, but it also eliminated, almost entirely, the enormous dockside pilferage that had been a chronic problem in all the world’s major ports.<br>***<br>One of the provisions agreed to by the U.S. in the early GATT negotiations following World War II was differential tariffs: the U.S. lowered its tariffs more than its trading partners did. Again, the purpose of this was to speed the economic rebuilding of allies and former enemies who had suffered devastation during the war. But World War II has now been over for 80 years. The economic recovery of Western Europe and the Far East has long since been accomplished. Yet the differential tariffs in many cases are still in existence.<br>The U.S., for instance, has a 2.5 percent tariff on cars imported from Germany, while Germany has a ten percent tariff on American cars. In addition, Germany’s value-added tax is remitted on exports but charged on imports. As a result, while the logos of Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Volkswagen are seen all over American roads, those of Ford and General Motors are a rare sight in Germany. And China, as already noted, is far worse, a world outlier, in terms of its nefarious trade policies.<br>President Trump wants to level this playing field. To do so, he has started what some are calling a trade war and others are calling the greatest example of “the art of the deal” in history. We will have to wait and see how it plays out. <br>___<br>John Steele Gordon was educated at Millbrook School and Vanderbilt University.

For example in 2023, Washington, D.C. saw a 39% increase in crime and the most murders in 25 years. Now, the capital city is reporting a 35% decrease in violent crime for 2024. <br>The past four years have been filled with debate over the national trends. Some say the government has been manipulating numbers. Today, we dig into the anatomy of how the reporting of crime stats has changed, and whether we’re getting the full truth.<br>The following is a transcript of a report from “Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson.”<br>Watch the video by clicking the link at the end of the page.<br>It’s not hard to find signs that crime has surged in some American cities. Yet many in media and politics insisted it’s just a mirage that there’s actually less crime.<br>In 2023, going into the election year, proof seemed to come in the FBI’s annual crime data.<br>The statistics showed a 2.1% decrease in violent crime in 2022 under the Biden administration.<br>President Joe Biden (Feb. 28, 2024): Last year, the United States had one of the lowest rates of all violent crime, of all violent crimes in more than 50 years.<br>To many, the good news seemed to fly in the face of the reality on the ground.<br>But when Donald Trump raised the issue in his debate against Kamala Harris, a moderator un-skeptically declared the FBI stats to be the final word.<br>Former President Donald Trump (Sept. 10, 2024): Crime here is up and through the roof despite their fraudulent statements that they made, crime in this country is through the roof. And we have a new form of crime and it’s called migrant crime. And it’s happening at levels nobody thought possible.<br>David Muir/Debate moderator: President Trump as you know the FBI says that overall is actually coming down in this country.<br>Trump: Excuse me they were defrauding statements. They didn’t include the worst cities. They didn’t include the cities with the worst crime. It was a fraud.<br>Trump may have known something the debate moderator didn’t.<br>Sharyl: Has there been a big shift in what we count as crimes, and how the FBI collects its statistics?<br>John Lott: There has been a big change.<br>John Lott is a crime data analyst and was a senior advisor for Research and Statistics in the Justice Department, which is over the FBI. He says the FBI crime stats shouldn’t be taken alone at face value.<br>Lott: Starting in 2021, they had a new system for reporting this data to the FBI from police departments around the country. In 2020, 97% of police departments reported data. In 2022, 31% of police departments didn’t report any crime data to the FBI another 24% only partially reported data. So you had less than half of police departments in 2022 and 2021 reporting complete crime data to the FBI. That’s a huge sea change.<br>Where there are gaps in data, Lott says FBI does attempt to fill in the blanks.<br>Lott: They try to guess. The question is how good of a job they do in guessing. I don’t think they do a very good job in terms of guessing.<br>He points to two distinct databases that he says should reflect similar trends but have produced impossibly opposite results: the FBI statistics, and the National Crime Victimization Survey, which tries to capture additional crimes that people don’t officially report.<br>Lott: And the reason why we have this national crime victimization data is we know most crimes aren’t reported to police. About 40% of violent crimes are reported to police. About 30% of property crimes are reported to police. Before 2020, those numbers tended to go up and down together, the reported and the National Crime Victimization data. Since 2020, they’ve been going in completely opposite directions. So for example, in 2022, while the FBI showed a 2% drop in violent crime, reported violent crime, the National Crime Victimization data showed a 42% increase in violent crime. That’s the largest yearly increase we’ve ever seen in that measure. And that’s going back 50 years.<br>Other factors that could make the crime rate seem lower than it is are: short staffed police departments with fewer officers to make arrests, and prosecutors not prosecuting some crimes.<br>Lott: What’s happened is unreported crime has increased. Okay? ‘Cause people say, ‘I’m only gonna report these crimes if I think the guy’s gonna get arrested.’<br>Sharyl: Based on the numbers you’ve seen. What would you say is the true crime trend in this country, and it may be different for violent crimes and nonviolent crimes, but what do you see in the numbers?<br>Lott: Well, I think it’s gone up tremendously violent crime during the Biden administration. I think it’s gone up by about 43% since he’s been president. And I think there are two reasons why the media wants to go and and kind of claim that it’s going down. One is just unfortunately, I think probably just to help the Democrats on this. But I think the other thing, and a number of Democrats have made this explicit is they say, “Look, we’ve had many millions of illegals coming into the country and violent crime is falling.” And so they say “it can’t be illegals causing more crime because crime is dropping over this period of time.”<br>Which brings us to another statistical trick, a flood of studies imply illegal immigrants are more law abiding than U.S. citizens.<br>The Marshall Project video clip: Our study found that immigrants are less likely to break the law than people born in the U.S.<br>But the studies often group legal immigrants in with illegal immigrants.<br>Lott: Now, what I’ve found, I did some work for the county prosecutors in Arizona a few years ago, is on their state prison system, is that you have big differences between legal and illegal immigrants. Legal immigrants seem to commit crimes at very low rates. Their share of the prison population was well below their share of the state population. Illegal immigrants though had a very high rate of crime, particularly very violent crime. Everything from kidnappings to murders compared to the general population that are there. Usually what happens in discussions is they mix the two together and so then they’ll get a rate that could be roughly similar or maybe even slightly below what it is for native born Americans. And I think that’s very misleading to lump those two groups together.<br>In fact, illegal immigrants have made up a disproportionately high number of prison inmates in America, indicating they commit far more serious crimes.<br>A decade ago, when illegal immigrants made up about one in thirty of the U.S. population, they accounted for a shocking one in four or five U.S. prison inmates, according to GAO. That included 4.9 million arrests for 7.5 million offenses including allegations of more than a million drug crimes, a half-million assaults, 133,800 sex offenses, 24,200 kidnappings, 33,300 homicide-related offenses, and 1,500 terrorism-related crimes. Nobody has tracked or updated the numbers since.<br>Meantime, stark evidence of Lott’s claims about crime going up not down under the Biden administration seemed to emerge after that presidential debate<br>Muir: President Trump as you know the FBI says that overall is actually coming down in this country.<br>Lott discovered the FBI quietly revised its 2022 figures from a 2.1% drop in violent crime to a 4.5% increase making a total rise of 6.6%. That includes 80,000 violent crimes that had gone uncounted: 33,000 additional robberies, 37,000 extra aggravated assaults, 7,000 more rapes, and 1,700 added murders.<br>Sharyl: Have crime statistics always been politicized and maybe somewhat manipulated?<br>Lott: I think it’s gotten a lot worse in the last few years, maybe over the last decade or so. It’s gotten a lot worse. I mean, there’s numbers that come out of the Department of Justice now that I just don’t believe at all.<br>Sharyl (on-camera): We asked the FBI what accounted for the correction in their violent crime stats for 2022. Did they undercount violent crime? And why FBI trends are opposite The National Crime Victimization Survey? They didn’t answer those questions but said there will be increasing transparency. And big cities like New York and LA resumed reporting their crime statistics to the FBI in 2023, when the FBI claims, again, that violent crime went down.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R168" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">169</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/27/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Bao giờ Trump mới thấy hai đứa Nga Tầu chỉ là một đồng một cốt thôi?<br>https://www.rferl.org/.../german-report-eu.../33425633.html<br>EU Finds China Responsible For 80 Percent Of Russia Sanctions Avoidance, Says German Report<br>(By RFE/RL&#39;s Russian Service - May 27, 2025 15:59 CET)<br>Russian President Vladimir Putin walks past a guard of honor with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Beijing last year.

(Illustration by The Free Press, image via Getty and Flickr)<br>A decade ago, the conservative intellectual shocked Washington with his ‘Flight 93 Election’ essay. He’s been gaining altitude ever since.<br>(By Eli Lake - The Free Press - 05.27.25 - U.S. Politics )<br>Listen to Article<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Over the weekend, Iranian envoys met with their U.S. counterparts at the Omani Embassy in Rome. At the table was Michael Anton, a senior State Department official with a penchant for charcoal-brown suits, Italian neckwear, and fine wine. Earlier this month, Anton was in Istanbul. He was sent by the Trump administration to keep tabs on the first face-to-face talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives after three years of war. It seems that wherever Trump’s highest stakes diplomacy is taking place, one will find Anton.<br>His name is not known to most people outside of Washington, but inside the Trump administration Anton has emerged as one of the most important intellectuals behind the president’s foreign policy revolution. In an administration beset with, at times, bitter ideological divides and an often chaotic style that has shocked both allies and foes, Anton has risen to the top by playing his cards close to his chest and deftly navigating the right’s warring foreign policy camps.<br>Anton has accompanied Secretary of State Marco Rubio on all but one of his overseas trips. He has been a key negotiator on U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff’s team to forge a Ukraine-Russia ceasefire. And last month, he was tapped to lead the technical talks with Iran over a possible new nuclear deal - a key role for any potential agreement that relies so much on devilish details.<br>Anton’s importance to the Trump administration was signaled early by the president himself. When he was appointed to be the director of the Policy Planning Staff at the State Department, Trump took the unprecedented step of announcing the news personally, a job normally left for the incoming secretary of state. “Michael served me loyally and effectively at the National Security Council in my First Term,” Trump posted on Truth Social on December 8. “He spent the last eight years explaining what an America First foreign policy truly means.”<br>In an administration that often resembles the court of a European monarch, where even cabinet secretaries don’t know where they stand, Trump’s post sent a powerful signal.<br>That Anton would emerge as such a trusted figure in Trump’s America First movement would be a surprise to anyone who knew Anton before 2016 - that is, before his viral, pseudonymous “Flight 93 Election” essay, and before Trump shocked the world with his election victory.<br>Back then, while now-Vice President J.D. Vance was warning that Trump was “cultural heroin,” Anton was insisting that he might be the only man who could save the republic from the rot and ruin of the left’s march through our institutions. “Trump, alone among candidates for high office in this or in the last seven (at least) cycles, has stood up to say: I want to live,” Anton wrote. “I want my party to live. I want my country to live. I want my people to live. I want to end the insanity.”<br>With a mix of provocative broadsides in the media and unglamorous behind-the-scenes work in government, Anton has charted an improbable path, from the heart of the neoconservative establishment to the core of the new MAGA foreign policy establishment. Over a decade in which the American right has been defined by bad-tempered, friendship-ending fights, Anton, a Machiavelli scholar, hasn’t just survived the America First revolution, he has helped to shape it.<br>As Anton’s star has risen in Washington, I spoke with a dozen of his friends, ex-friends, and colleagues, and with D.C. insiders, to understand how a man who once wrote speeches for former president George W. Bush and former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and contributed pieces to the now-defunct neoconservative Weekly Standard came to be the nation’s chief explainer of Trump’s foreign policy.<br>Born in northern California, Michael Anton spent most of his career inside a Republican establishment that is now a smoldering ruin. He was a mid-level staffer on strategic communications for Bush’s National Security Council (NSC). He was part of the administration that invaded Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11. He was, in other words, the very kind of Republican the Trump movement has largely exiled.<br>Elliott Abrams, who worked with Anton in the Bush administration and also served Trump in his first term, said Anton is “a principled person, and he is not going to do anything in this job or any other that he doesn’t believe in.”<br>Before working for Bush, Anton was with Rudy Giuliani, at the time the pro-choice mayor of New York. Anton was also an adviser on Giuliani’s 2008 presidential campaign; he wrote speeches for Rupert Murdoch.<br>In addition to all of that, he is a classically trained chef with a weakness for esoteric interpretations of ancient texts and a love of good tailoring. He has written a book (under the pseudonym Nicholas Antongiavanni), The Suit, imagining how Niccolò Machiavelli would advise young professionals to dress for the office. (Chapter titles include “Of Those Things for Which Men and Especially Dandies Are Praised or Blamed” and “How Men of Superfluous Girth May Minimize Their Appearance.”)<br>“Michael Anton is a classically trained chef with a weakness for esoteric interpretations of ancient texts and a love of good tailoring,” writes Eli Lake. (Doug Mills/The New York Times/Redux)<br>John Avlon, who worked with Anton on Giuliani’s 2008 presidential campaign and is now a Democrat who ran for Congress on Long Island at the last election, told The Free Press that Anton “would occasionally come into the office, as I recall, always in his three-piece suits. He is obviously smart. He had a self-effacing sense of humor, when it was deployed. He was basically a team player. But he wasn’t remotely a man-of-the-people kind of guy.” Avlon added, “Anton was a conventional movement conservative in the George W. Bush era, albeit with a Straussian background,” a reference to the political philosopher and Plato translator Leo Strauss.<br>A look back at Anton’s contributions to the Weekly Standard makes the point. In 2011, for example, Anton argued that former president Barack Obama’s intelligence community was playing games with its estimates on Iran’s missile program. The same year, Anton defended Dick Cheney against Bob Woodward’s criticism of the former vice president for being the only member of the Bush cabinet to support an Israeli strike on a Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007. Today, the Cheneys are heretics inside the MAGA movement because of Liz Cheney’s Congressional inquiry into the January 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol.<br>Anton - who declined to be interviewed for this profile - is, in the best sense and by his own admission, a reactionary. He experienced as an undergrad in the late 1980s the campus culture of Berkeley and sprinted in the other direction. “Despite having grown up with hippies all around me, and having attended my fair share of Cal games, I really had no idea what Berkeley was going to be like,” he wrote in 2014 for the Claremont Review of Books. “It took about six weeks for me to realize, ‘These people are nuts!’ I am thus a reactionary in the strict sense: My politics were formed, at least initially, in opposition to that madness.”<br>Those words were gleaned from an essay Anton wrote in appreciation of his late academic mentor, Harry Jaffa, a legendary political theorist whose scholarship on Abraham Lincoln and the founding fathers has informed generations of conservatives. Jaffa revered Lincoln for his courage and will to do what is necessary to preserve the union and the republican American experiment.<br>To Anton’s ex-friends in the conservative movement, he has betrayed this tradition by aligning himself to a president who has not conceded his loss in the 2020 election. But Anton broke with that old establishment long ago.<br>And he did so with an essay that exploded like a nuclear bomb in D.C.<br>When Anton sat down to write “The Flight 93 Election” nearly a decade ago, he had jumped from politics to finance, working as a managing director at BlackRock, the global investment firm that today is the bête noire for MAGA populists. In other words, he had become the epitome of the establishment he was about to pillory.<br>Anton’s argument in the essay could hardly have been more provocative. He wrote that a third consecutive Democratic presidency would leave the republic in shambles. This was a break-glass moment. As the title of the essay telegraphs, conservatives had an obligation in 2016 to storm the cockpit to prevent the calamity of hijackers crashing it into the White House.<br>“A Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian Roulette with a semi-auto,” read the essay. “With Trump, at least you can spin the cylinder and take your chances.”<br>The villains are not only the Democrats. He also rails against “Conservativism, Inc.,” which he compares to the Washington Generals, the basketball team paid to lose to the Harlem Globetrotters. He blasts the “Davoisie,” a portmanteau for the head-in-the-clouds elites that dream up “inanities like 32 ‘genders,’ elective bathrooms, single-payer, Iran sycophancy, ‘Islamophobia,’ and Black Lives Matter.”<br>The Claremont Review of Books published “Flight 93” on its website on September 5, 2016. A version was submitted to the journal in January of 2015 that made the case for Trump before any of the Republican primaries. It was rejected at first because the board of the Claremont Review was divided on Trump. No one expected the essay to cause major waves. But it was a sensation. On September 7, 2016, Rush Limbaugh read the entire thing on his syndicated radio show, hailing it as the best argument against the burgeoning Never Trump movement at the time.<br>Ryan Williams, the president of the Claremont Institute and publisher of the Claremont Review of Books, told me Rush’s endorsement ended up crashing their website.<br>Adding to the intrigue surrounding the essay was that no one knew who wrote it. The article that was all anyone could talk about was written under a pseudonym: Publius Decius Mus.<br>Anton’s choice of pen name is revealing. Publius Decius Mus is not a reference to the Publius of The Federalist Papers, the pen names of Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. This Publius refers to three generations of Roman leaders, two of whom sacrificed their lives during the Samnite Wars to save the republic.<br>An establishment Republican who had a cushy job in finance, Anton had a lot to lose and little to gain from writing the piece. “If you look at the world in which Mike was working, the New York corporate world and the social circles Mike was in, that essay was a huge risk, including most importantly to his ability to feed and clothe his family,” Williams told The Free Press in an interview.<br>In September 2016, Trump was widely considered a vulgarian loser. One has to remember that Ted Cruz, the last Republican standing in the primary against Trump that year, refused to endorse him at the party’s convention. Dozens of Republican policymakers signed a “never Trump” pledge in 2016. Even J.D. Vance was against Trump in the fall of 2016. When “Flight 93” was published, Hillary Clinton looked like she was headed to a landslide victory. The smart money was not on Trump.<br>Williams said that when Anton wrote the “Flight 93” essay he had no assurances from the Trump campaign that they would give him a job if they won. “Given what we know about the corporate culture and ideological commitments of BlackRock,” he said, “it was easy to predict that had he written it under his own name, they would have terminated him.”<br>Anton’s secret was safe until February 3, 2017. That’s when journalist Michael Warren blew his cover in a scoop for The Weekly Standard. By this time, Anton was back at the National Security Council as the deputy assistant to the president for strategic communications. He was still waiting for his last bonus from BlackRock when the news hit.<br>“Over a decade in which the right has been defined by bad-tempered, friendship-ending fights, Anton hasn’t just survived the America First revolution, he has helped to shape it,” writes Eli Lake. (Carolyn Kaster via AP Photo)<br>In Washington, Anton became a target. For the Beltway establishment, now in the throes of the Russiagate moral panic, the unveiling of Publius was another piece of evidence that Trump was indeed a Mussolini-in-waiting. Jonathan Chait, writing in New York magazine, wrote that Anton’s essay had helped provide the intellectual gloss for the “right-wing case against democracy.” Bill Kristol, the founding editor of The Weekly Standard and now editor of The Bulwark, compared Anton to Carl Schmitt, the political theorist who enthusiastically supported the Nazis and allowed his obsession with power to warp his obligation to the truth as an intellectual.<br>Anton, of course, is not Schmitt, and he has not made the “right-wing case against democracy.” But he has also declined to endorse the outcome of the 2020 election. When pressed about it by Andrew Sullivan in a 2021 interview on Sullivan’s podcast, Anton said, “We may never know the outcome.”<br>“The Flight 93 Election” will turn nine this year, and it is evidently a point of pride for Anton: His official biography page for the State Department says Anton “is perhaps best known as the author of ‘The Flight 93 Election,’ the 2016 viral essay that galvanized many to support then-candidate Trump.”<br>In this decade-old mini-scandal around the essay and its author, one finds the roots of a problem that plagues the country today. Yes, the “Flight 93” essay in 2016 read to many (including me) like apocalyptic hyperbole. It was an extreme analysis that justified the violation of political norms to stop an existential threat. But in Chait’s and Kristol’s responses to “Flight 93,” one finds a similar apocalyptic hyperbole. Comparing Anton to Schmitt is another way of saying the elected president is Hitler.<br>In 2025, after the FBI’s meritless investigation into the Trump campaign’s phantom collusion with Russia, the purges and cancellations of the George Floyd summer, and the reckless federal and state prosecutions of Trump, even after he was his party’s nominee for 2024, the “Flight 93” essay seems less extreme—almost prescient. Today, both parties accept their own version of Anton’s apocalyptic logic.<br>In other words, Michael Anton saw where American politics was headed before almost anyone else. And for that he has been rewarded with the trust of a grateful and capricious president. That in and of itself is a remarkable feat. When Anton wrote “Flight 93,” he didn’t know Trump and had no offers for a future job in his administration. But he wrote his way into a job, and ended up serving as the director of strategic communications for the National Security Council for the first two years of Trump’s first presidency.<br>By 2024, Anton’s influence had only grown, and after the election he played a crucial role during the presidential transition. While Trump personally interviewed his future cabinet secretaries and other consiglieri like Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson weighed in on big-ticket positions, Anton was a key gatekeeper. He interviewed almost all of the subcabinet national security officials at the campaign headquarters in West Palm Beach, Florida, according to three administration officials. He wrote a binder-length memo detailing how the second Trump administration should organize the National Security Council.<br>During the transition, Anton was originally offered the job of deputy national security adviser, but turned it down because he would not work with Sebastian Gorka, the current chief of counterterrorism on the NSC staff. Gorka and Anton have a long-running feud from the first Trump administration over whether the former is owed credit for drafting Trump’s 2017 UN speech, which was one of the first articulations of Trump’s nationalist foreign policy. (Anton explained in a 2023 piece for The American Mind that he was instructed by his superiors at the White House to deny Gorka’s authorship in the press.)<br>After Anton politely declined the deputy national security adviser slot, Trump’s inner circle scrambled to make room for him at the State Department, one administration official told me.<br>Anton was offered the job of director of the Office of Policy Planning at the State Department. The title might not mean much to outsiders, but it’s an influential and storied posting, heading an in-house think tank created for the legendary Cold War strategist George F. Kennan.<br>Kennan’s old office has lost some luster in recent decades. Recent directors have spun their wheels analyzing long-term trends in geopolitics as the State Department’s higher-ups made actual foreign policy. For Anton though, the job has been a perch of significant influence. As one senior State Department official told me, “Michael Anton has been laying the groundwork for the moment we find ourselves in today. He has a very earnest, head down, do your work, don’t-seek-the-limelight approach. He understands his job is to implement the president’s policies, not his own.”<br>Anton himself is a student of Kennan, who authored the “Long Telegram,” a memo that detailed how to deter Soviet expansion in Europe while not wasting resources on liberating the captive nations Joseph Stalin swallowed up after the Allied victory in World War II. This strategy, known as containment, set the parameters for U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War. Containment begat many of the institutions that populists today consider relics of a bygone era, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.<br>And yet Anton sees Kennan as a proto-populist. In a thorough and at times acerbic 2022 essay for the Claremont Review of Books, Anton resurrects the second half of Kennan’s career, where he was not the clear-eyed hawk that today’s interventionists imagine. Rather, Kennan was someone with views about the inevitability of Russia’s domination of Ukraine very similar to today’s “restrainers.” Anton wrote that Kennan “rejected in advance the Western policies that helped lead to the present war and he would almost certainly oppose the Western aid that keeps it going. If his track record is any guide, he would - as ever - advocate peace talks.” In this respect, Anton sees Kennan as someone who “shared more opinions with today’s populist right than with the contemporary left.” And someone who would support the administration’s current approach of negotiating with America’s authoritarian foes.<br>Insights like that make Anton’s foreign policy difficult to pin down. He is neither a “restrainer” nor a “primacist.” Some of his friends have called him a Jacksonian, meaning that he supports a strong role for the U.S. military in the western hemisphere and respects the interests of other great powers.<br>Anton’s friend David Reaboi, a Republican national security analyst, told The Free Press that Anton defies traditional labels in U.S. foreign policy because “his ideas have been shaped by witnessing America’s ideology-driven overreach in the last few decades—but also by the awareness that, regardless of these policy mistakes, the U.S. has real enemies and strategic interests to manage globally.”<br>In a 2019 piece for Foreign Policy magazine, Anton defined the Trump doctrine as a foreign policy rooted in the idea that nations should pursue their national interests instead of sublimating them to idealistic distractions, such as building democracies abroad or opening borders to endless immigration. “In declining to act in their interests, Western and democratic countries create opportunities for unfriendly powers, unashamed to act in their interests, to exploit what they see as Western naivete,” he wrote. Another way to state this, Anton wrote, was as Trump himself has said: “Don’t be a chump.”<br>But the national interest is in the eye of the beholder. It is not preordained or self-evident. On the specifics, Anton is hard to pin down. However, there are clues to his thinking. In 2021, he wrote a lengthy historical analysis for The Federalist that argues the Chinese want Taiwan far more than America wants it to remain independent. “The best thing for Taiwan and the United States is the preservation of the status quo for as long as possible,” Anton wrote. “But there is no core American national interest that would compel us to go to war over Taiwan.”<br>One might think then that Anton would oppose going to war with Iran to prevent it from going nuclear. But his views on this important subject are ambiguous. He played a key role in his stint in the first Trump administration’s National Security Council, laying the groundwork for the U.S. withdrawal from Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. In his “Flight 93” essay, Anton bemoaned “Iran sycophancy” as one of the many inanities favored by the Democratic Party that real conservatives had an obligation to try to stop.<br>All of that said, the key to Anton’s rise is that he has proven himself to be a kind of political samurai. He is first and foremost loyal to his principal and by extension, his ultimate boss, Donald Trump. “He doesn’t want to graft his own particular policies on the president,” Reaboi told The Free Press. “He is not setting out to undermine the president and that is why it is hard to classify him using the normal, quick and dirty hawks-and-doves lens.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R170" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">171</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/27/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">‘THE ART OF THE DEAL’: <br>HÃY GIÚP NGƯỜI ĐIÊN HỌC KINH TẾ SỬ<br>trước khi lâm trận! Một bài mà ban tham mưu của giáo chủ củ bựa nên đọc để khuyên nhau khỏi làm trò hề!<br>https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/tariffs-in-american.../...<br>May 2025 | Volume 54, Issue 5<br>Tariffs in American History<br>By John Steele Gordon, Author, An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power<br>The following is adapted from a lecture delivered in Washington, D.C., on May 6, 2025, as part of the AWC Family Foundation Lecture Series. Sponsored by Hillsdale College’s Allan P. Kirby, Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship, which is undergoing extensive expansion and renovation, the lecture was delivered in The Heritage Foundation’s Van Andel–Gaby Center.<br>Tariffs are among the oldest of taxes for the simple reason that they are easy to collect. Just send in the tax collectors and don’t let the goods being transported move until the duty has been paid. Being one of the earliest forms of taxation, it is not surprising that tariffs produced one of the earliest forms of tax evasion: smuggling.<br>In America’s colonial period, the east coast of the United States, with its many rivers and inlets that the small ships of those days could utilize, lent itself to smuggling, and the American colonists evaded British tariffs on a grand scale.<br>Indeed, Rhode Island, with its long coastline relative to the area and its many small harbors, was the epicenter of colonial smuggling, and it opposed any attempts to suppress it. Rhode Island was the first colony to foreswear allegiance to Great Britain, on May 4, 1776, two months before the Declaration of Independence. It was also the only state not to send delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, fearing that a stronger federal government, empowered to tax, would suppress smuggling. And it was the last state to ratify the Constitution, on May 29, 1790, more than a year after the federal government had come into existence. It did so then only under the threat of having its exports taxed as if from a foreign nation.<br>When the Constitution took effect in 1789, the first order of business was to straighten out the nation’s disastrous financial situation. That is why the new State Department started out with only five employees while the Treasury Department had 40.<br>When Alexander Hamilton became the nation’s first Secretary of the Treasury, he immediately began to prepare a schedule of tariffs, along with excise taxes on such commodities as alcohol and tobacco. The Constitution forbids taxing the exports of any state, and so American tariffs have always been laid only on imports.<br>Collectors were named for each port, and these were considered plum jobs because the collector got to keep the money, earning interest on it, until it was forwarded to the federal government a few times a year.<br>Hamilton’s tariffs, along with the refunding of the national debt and the establishment of a central bank, transformed the American financial situation. By the end of the 1790s, the U.S. had the best credit rating in Europe, its bonds selling over par. By 1800, federal revenues, a mere $3.7 million in 1792, had nearly tripled to $10.8 million. About 90 percent of that revenue came from tariffs—a ratio that wouldn’t change much, except during the Civil War, for more than a century.<br>***<br>Hamilton’s tariffs had been solely for the purpose of raising revenue. But, of course, there is another use to which tariffs can be put: the protection of domestic industries from foreign competition.<br>In 1789, except for shipbuilding, there had been little American industry to protect. At his first inauguration, George Washington had been symbolically careful to wear a suit made of cloth woven in the U.S. rather than from cloth imported from Britain, as almost all high-quality cloth was at that time.<br>Britain was where the industrial spinning and weaving technology was, and Britain was determined to keep it there. Textile machinery, as well as plans for it, could not be exported - and those with expertise in the industry were not allowed to emigrate. This problem (when seen from an American viewpoint) was solved through industrial espionage. Samuel Slater, who had apprenticed in the cloth industry and had a marked talent for mechanics, carefully memorized the needed plans for spinning and weaving machinery and sailed to America, having listed himself as a farmhand on the ship’s manifest.<br>Within a year, using capital from Rhode Island’s Brown family (for whom Brown University is named), Slater had a spinning mill in operation. The American Industrial Revolution had begun - and with it a push for protective tariffs.<br>New England, with its many clear-running streams and rivers to provide waterpower, soon had a flourishing spinning industry, whereas the weaving of cloth was still initially done at home. But in 1814, Francis Cabot Lowell built a factory that would merge spinning and weaving into the first fully integrated cloth mill in the world.<br>The Embargo Act of 1807 and the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 had disrupted the importation of British cloth, and the War of 1812 had ended it. With a near monopoly in the American market, New England’s nascent textile industry flourished. But the end of the war with Britain in 1814 brought renewed British competition and even the dumping of cheap British cloth in the American market. To protect their profits, New England cloth manufacturers, led by Lowell, went to Washington and lobbied for a protective tariff.<br>Protective tariffs have a surface plausibility, especially where new industries are just getting on their feet and are not yet as efficient as older foreign ones. But tariffs, as noted, are taxes, which are largely paid by domestic consumers, not foreign manufacturers. They also often allow domestic manufacturers to raise their own prices. Regardless, Lowell and his fellow manufacturers got Congress to impose a 25-cent-per-yard tariff on British cotton cloth.<br>By the 1820s, American manufacturing, hardly existent in 1789 when the Constitution had come into effect, was growing at enormous speed. In 1824 there were two million people employed in manufacturing, ten times the number of only five years earlier. But almost all that manufacturing was taking place in Northern states. The South, wedded to the fantastic profits generated by cotton production after the invention of the cotton gin, remained almost wholly agricultural.<br>So Northern voters increasingly wanted a high tariff to protect their industries and their jobs, and Southern voters wanted a low tariff to reduce the prices they had to pay for manufactured goods. This sectional dispute led to the first existential threat to the Union.<br>***<br>The national debt had tripled during the War of 1812, after which surpluses from tariffs were used to pay it back down. Indeed, with its fast-rising industrial sector, the Northern states wanted even higher tariffs on industrial goods.<br>In 1828, as a new tariff bill was moving through Congress, Southern politicians thought they had a way to defeat it. While New England’s vast textile industry wanted high tariffs on industrial goods such as cloth, it needed to import such raw materials as wool, flax for making linen, and hemp for making rope for its shipbuilding industry. Southern congressmen inserted high tariffs of 45 percent on these commodities into the bill hoping to split off enough New England congressmen to defeat it. Their attempt failed, the tariff bill passed, and President John Quincy Adams signed it into law even though he knew it would hurt him politically. The South, ever an exporter of snappy political phrases, dubbed it the “Tariff of Abominations,” as it has been known ever since.<br>Adams was, indeed, defeated in his re-election bid by Andrew Jackson. But Jackson, while a Southerner himself, was determined to pay off the national debt and was willing to tolerate a high tariff in order to do so. Not so his vice president, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, who was adamantly opposed to the tariff of 1828. After its passage, Calhoun anonymously wrote a pamphlet asserting the right of states to nullify federal laws that they regarded as unconstitutional.<br>In November of 1832, after the tariff bill of that year did not lower tariffs enough to suit Southern demands - tariffs on specific industrial products were lowered from 45 to 35 percent, but others remained the same - the South Carolina legislature passed an Ordinance of Nullification, declaring the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 to be null and void within the borders of the state.<br>President Jackson would have none of that. Not given to mincing words, he wrote: “I consider... the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.”<br>Jackson threatened military action if necessary to enforce federal law and was authorized by Congress to use it. Only the Compromise Tariff of 1833, in which duties were to be reduced over ten years to the levels of 1816, brought the crisis to an end, with South Carolina repealing its Ordinance of Nullification.<br>With American industry becoming ever more efficient - thanks in no small part to the country’s secret weapon, Yankee ingenuity - tariff protection became less necessary, and tariffs generally trended downwards until the coming of the Civil War.<br>***<br>With the outbreak of war in 1861, government expenses exploded. Prior to the firing on Fort Sumter, the federal government had been spending about $172,000 a day. By the Battle of Bull Run three months later, the War Department alone was spending $1 million a day. While much of the cost of the war could be thrown onto the future by selling bonds, taxes - including tariffs - rose sharply as well. There were also new taxes, such as the country’s first income tax and a stamp tax on legal documents.<br>The combination of wartime demand and high tariffs produced an enormous boom in American industry as new domestic production replaced foreign imports. After the war, this new industry demanded protection against foreign competition, while the South, always opposed to high tariffs, was politically prostrate.<br>Also there was the need to pay off the colossal debt incurred during the war. With wartime tariffs still largely in place, the federal government ran 28 straight surpluses between 1866 and 1894, despite a serious depression from 1873 to 1879. The debt in dollar terms was cut by more than half between 1866 and 1900, and as a percentage of the fast-rising GDP it fell by far more.<br>But tariffs are a consumption tax and therefore fall hardest on the poor, who must spend all their income to buy necessities. So there was increasing political pressure for an income tax on the rich that would finance a lowering of tariffs. But in 1895, the Supreme Court ruled such a tax unconstitutional. Meanwhile tariffs trended down only slightly.<br>In 1899, a legal dispute between Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie caused the enormous profits of the privately held Carnegie Steel Company to become public. By then, Carnegie Steel was manufacturing so efficiently that the company was successfully exporting to both Great Britain and Germany, where the steel industry had been born. With the facts in the open, the excuse that American industry needed protection from more efficient European companies began to collapse. As a result, tariffs began to decline significantly. Average tariffs, above 50 percent in 1900, were under 20 percent by 1920.<br>***<br>Although American industry flourished in the 1920s, the agricultural sector of the economy did not. American farming had been hugely profitable during World War I, thanks to a steep decline in European production as farmhands went to war, as well as to the Ottoman Empire’s blockade of Russia’s wheat exports, which had been the largest in the world in 1913. Peace brought that agricultural prosperity to a rapid halt, and drought in the American Midwest made matters worse. Rural banks began to fail at an average rate of 500 per year during the ’20s. Worse still, the rapid spread of the automobile and the tractor caused more and more land that had been devoted to fodder crops—about one-third of the total land under cultivation in 1900—to be used to produce food for humans instead, driving down prices sharply.<br>In 1928, presidential candidate Herbert Hoover promised farmers a protective tariff on farm products. But by the time Hoover became president and the bill was considered in Congress, the Wall Street crash had happened and the economy was moving into recession. What resulted was a feeding-frenzy of special interests. Industries and whole economic sectors alike sought protection in the slowing economy and Congress obliged. Even tombstone makers got a protective tariff.<br>The result, called the Smoot-Hawley Tariff after its principal sponsors in the Senate and House, was to raise the tariff on 20,000 imported commodities. It was the highest tariff in American history.<br>Economists were appalled and more than a thousand signed a petition asking Hoover to veto the bill. Thomas Lamont, a senior partner at J.P. Morgan and Company, wrote: “I almost went down on my knees to beg Herbert Hoover to veto the asinine Hawley-Smoot Tariff. That Act intensified nationalism all over the world.”<br>Lamont was right. Foreign countries quickly built their own tariff walls to unprecedented heights and world trade collapsed. In 1929, it had amounted to about $36 billion. By 1932, global trade was only $12 billion, one-third as much. American exports had been $5.241 billion in 1929. Three years later they were down to $1.161 billion, a 78 percent drop. In constant dollar terms, American exports were lower than they had been in 1896 when the economy had been one-fifth the size.<br>Congress’s Smoot-Hawley Tariff, the Federal Reserve’s keeping interest rates high in order to protect the gold standard, and the Hoover administration’s attempt to balance the budget in 1932 with sharply higher taxes, were the three huge public-policy mistakes that converted an ordinary stock market crash and recession into the Great Depression.<br>***<br>In World War II, the industrial bases of Germany and Japan were flattened and those of the other great powers, except for the U.S., were severely impacted. In a rare example in the history of foreign policy of enlightened self-interest, rebuilding their economies was a major priority for the U.S. The intention was to restore prosperity in these devastated countries and thus to make them less susceptible to the Soviet aggression that had already taken much of Eastern Europe.<br>Reviving world trade was an important component of that. In 1947, 23 countries met in Geneva, Switzerland, and they established the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Recognizing how counterproductive the beggar-thy-neighbor trade policies of the 1930s had been, the preamble called for a “substantial reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers and the elimination of preferences, on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis.” The “other trade barriers” included quotas, import and export licenses, domestic tax reductions on exports, and direct subsidies.<br>In the first round of GATT negotiations, 45,000 tariffs were reduced, affecting about $10 billion in annual world trade. Further rounds, eight in all - the latest is still ongoing - followed as more and more countries joined GATT. Each round saw further reductions in tariffs and trade barriers.<br>In 1995, GATT evolved into the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 1999, Communist China, which had seen explosive economic growth since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, was admitted to the WTO. It was hoped that by being allowed to join the club, China would follow the rules. It has not. It has been guilty of massive theft of intellectual property as well as other nefarious trade policies as it made exports the centerpiece of its economy.<br>GATT was arguably the most successful diplomatic effort in world history. As noted, in 1932, global trade had amounted to $12 billion. By 2023 it had grown to $23 trillion. In other words, global trade, in constant dollars, has multiplied more than 80 times in 80 years.<br>To see an example of how much this has changed the world, look at the labels on your clothes. In 1947, they would mostly have been made in Manhattan’s Garment District and in other such centers of the American clothing industry. Today they are made in such places as Bangladesh, Nicaragua, and Cambodia. These countries have a large comparative advantage in clothing manufacturing - which is labor intensive but not capital intensive - thanks to their very low semi-skilled labor costs. And while the wages of these countries are very low compared with American wages even today, they are a lot more than what these people were earning two generations ago. In 1950, according to the World Bank, 62.12 percent of the world’s population was living in extreme poverty. In 2017, the percentage had fallen to 9.18 percent.<br>Never in human history has poverty fallen so far so fast. No small part of that triumph has been the lowering of trade barriers, first and foremost tariffs.<br>To be sure, not all of this enormous increase in world trade is due to GATT. One of the most important, if perhaps least exciting, inventions of the 20th century was the shipping container. It not only greatly reduced turnaround times because ships could be loaded and unloaded much more quickly, but it also eliminated, almost entirely, the enormous dockside pilferage that had been a chronic problem in all the world’s major ports.<br>***<br>One of the provisions agreed to by the U.S. in the early GATT negotiations following World War II was differential tariffs: the U.S. lowered its tariffs more than its trading partners did. Again, the purpose of this was to speed the economic rebuilding of allies and former enemies who had suffered devastation during the war. But World War II has now been over for 80 years. The economic recovery of Western Europe and the Far East has long since been accomplished. Yet the differential tariffs in many cases are still in existence.<br>The U.S., for instance, has a 2.5 percent tariff on cars imported from Germany, while Germany has a ten percent tariff on American cars. In addition, Germany’s value-added tax is remitted on exports but charged on imports. As a result, while the logos of Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Volkswagen are seen all over American roads, those of Ford and General Motors are a rare sight in Germany. And China, as already noted, is far worse, a world outlier, in terms of its nefarious trade policies.<br>President Trump wants to level this playing field. To do so, he has started what some are calling a trade war and others are calling the greatest example of “the art of the deal” in history. We will have to wait and see how it plays out. <br>___<br>John Steele Gordon was educated at Millbrook School and Vanderbilt University.

Photo: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images<br>Only two men will be able to look back with real satisfaction on the role they played in the passage last week of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the House’s attempt at implementing most of President Trump’s fiscal agenda.<br>The first is Speaker Mike Johnson, who again showed that there may be no more proficient cat-herder in the country. Leading a fractious Republican caucus that enjoys - if that’s the word - a majority of a mere handful over a mostly united Democratic opposition, and under threat for more than 18 months that one false move would cost him his job, Mr. Johnson prevailed again. The speaker has compared himself to Moses, leading his harried tribe through the Red Sea. A better analogy might be Jason, repeatedly piloting his Argonauts between the Scylla of Trumpian disapproval and the Charybdis of popular distrust.<br>The second is Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R., N.Y.), who fell asleep in the small hours while the vote was being taken, according to Mr. Johnson, and missed the final roll call. Having been in a state of unconsciousness when the measure passed may save him from having played his part in a monstrous act of economic mismanagement.<br>The bill’s many defects have been well rehearsed on these and other pages: the fiscal incontinence that will see the addition of $3 trillion to the government’s $36 trillion in debt in the next 10 years; the failure to produce anything more than an exiguous reversal of the spending extravaganza of the past five years, with cuts of less than 2% of projected outlays over the next decade; the re-complexification of the tax code that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs act had admirably simplified, with a smorgasbord of new deductions and exemptions; the reward for Democrat-run states’ profligacy represented by the quadrupling of the state and local tax deduction. It is no golden fleece that Jason and his crew have brought home.<br>But the specifics of the measure are less important than the overall picture of political dysfunction and economic ineptitude. Instead of doing its part to facilitate the better parts of Mr. Trump’s economic ideas and acting as constitutional ballast against the bad parts, Congress is diluting the good stuff and doubling down on the madness. So bigger tax cuts driven by the pursuit of narrow short-term political advantage, allied to minimal spending restraint, are unfolding alongside the administration’s ruinous (and almost certainly unlawful) global trade and international economic policies.<br>All of this casts bigger doubt on the durability of America’s unique model of market-driven, innovation-led, private-sector-generated growth. We are witnessing all the signs of advancing economic derangement at the public-sector level: policy unpredictability, fiscal disorder and erratic interventionism on the shifting whims of a mercurial leader. This great republic is moving steadily up the steep curve of the banana.<br>We have a president who makes radical changes to tariffs based on economically dim views about international trade, who then changes and unilaterally changes them again with no notice or consultation, who believes he has the authority to tell companies like Walmart what they should be charging their customers and companies like Apple exactly where and how they should source their production, who seems intent on discouraging the brightest minds in the world from coming to the U.S., where they have contributed to America’s world-beating success in science, technology, innovation and entrepreneurship for decades.<br>We have a Congress that unilaterally surrenders its constitutional responsibility over much of this policymaking and weighs in happily to compound the problem with politically expedient and economically reckless contributions of its own.<br>And yes, before you object, this after four years of a Democratic administration with a complaisant Congress that seized the opportunity presented by a dementia-disabled president to advance its own radical and economically ruinous goals.<br>In 2025 the value of the U.S. dollar has declined by almost 10% against other currencies. Since “Liberation Day,” the interest rate investors demand to hold the safest of risk-free assets, 10-year U.S. government debt, has risen by half a percentage point to 4.5%. The spread between U.S. and German 10-year bond yields has increased by almost a full percentage point this year. This is a reflection of rising concern about U.S. fiscal sustainability as well as an attempt by markets to price the cost of policy uncertainty, capricious governing and instability.<br>For the past decade, American business has enhanced its advantage over the rest of the world, innovating in artificial intelligence, biotech and finance, boosting its productivity. Most of that has been achieved not because of policy but in spite of it. If investors begin to see American private-sector Gullivers tied down by political Lilliputians, our economic powerhouse constrained by erratic, unstable and obstructive government, the threat to American supremacy is real. Lawmakers may want to stay awake for that.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R172" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">173</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/27/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">HOA KỲ LÂM CHIẾN VÀ ĐẠI BẠI TẠI VIỆT NAM <br>[2] HOA KỲ BẤT NHẤT NÊN THẤT BẠI<br>Trước hết, chúng ta cần nhớ vài ba yếu tố liên quan tới địa dư. <br>DỐT VỀ ĐỊA DƯ LẠI CÒN HỖN<br>Hoa Kỳ hình thành như một mảng của Âu Châu nên mối quan tâm của dân Mỹ tập trung vào Âu Châu và quan hệ quốc tế then chốt vẫn là Âu-Mỹ.

Nếu Gia Long tỉnh táo có khi Việt Nam khỏi rơi vào tay thực dân Pháp, biết đâu còn bành trướng, thậm chí thôn tính cả Miên và Lào!...<br>Khi đối chiếu nhận thức tạm gọi là Mỹ-Việt quá khác biệt, ta nhìn ra cái mầm thất bại của Mỹ từ 1962, liên quan tới việc Chính quyền John Kennedy muốn trung lập hóa nước Lào nhằm hòa giải với Liên Xô qua hiệp ước Geneve đàm phán từ 1961 đến 1962. <br>Vốn dĩ thuộc sử và biết rõ yếu tố chiến lược của địa dư, Chính quyền Ngô Đình Diệm không đồng ý với việc trung lập hóa nước Lào, vì lãnh thổ Lào rồi cả Miên sẽ là đường tiến quân của cộng sản Việt Nam từ Bắc vào Nam (‘đường mòn Hồ Chí Minh’ sau này)! Việc Việt Nam triệt thoái đại sứ khỏi hội nghị Geneve về Lào được Averell Harriman cho là sự vô lễ của bọn man rợ. Đó mới là tên đại gia man rợ của phe Dân Chủ!<br>Sau địa dư, ta bước qua lịch sử!<br>GIAN VỀ LỊCH SỬ LẠI CÒN XẠO<br>Kennedy là tổng thống Dân Chủ được dân Mỹ yêu quý - nhất là sau khi bị ám sát ngày 22 Tháng 11 1963. Chứ về thực chất, đấy là tên lưu manh hạ cấp. Trong trận đấu trí với Liên Xô (và Nikita Krushchev) năm 1962 tại Cuba, Kennedy thua trí mà dư luận Mỹ ngu lại coi là thắng lớn, vì Liên Xô tháo gỡ hỏa tiễn chưa ráp tại Cuba chứ Hoa Kỳ lại tháo gỡ hỏa tiễn đã có của NATO nằm trong lãnh thổ Turkey và có thể bắn tới Moscow!<br>Vì vậy, Kennedy muốn chọn một nơi đấu trí với Liên Xô mà ở xa và an toàn cho Mỹ hơn là đất Cuba. Đấy là Việt Nam. Kennedy tăng quân viện cho Việt Nam Cộng Hòa để biểu diễn ý chí chống cộng nhưng dự định là sau khi tái đắc cử năm 1964, Kennedy sẽ nặn ra một chính quyền dễ bảo tại Sàigon, để chính quyền đó yêu cầu Mỹ rút quân khỏi Việt Nam! Kennedy tính sâu xa và thâm hiểm như vậy nên Phó Tổng thống Lyndon Johnson còn không biết.<br>Hóa ra chủ trương be bờ chống cộng sản bành trướng của Mỹ lại thay đổi: Việt Nam phải xây dựng dân chủ, vì chính quyền Ngô Đình Diệm thiếu dân chủ nên không thể tồn tại. Vậy mà chẳng ai hỏi về tiêu chuẩn tự do dân chủ tại Hà Nội. Nào ngờ, sau khi cho đảo chính và lật đổ chính quyền Diệm (mà y chối là không ngờ!), 21 ngày sau, Kennedy bị giết tại Dallas. Và Johnson lên thay đã cố duy trì chủ trương ‘chống cộng’ của vị tiền nhiệm.<br>Vào quãng 2014, một ký giả lão thành của UPI là Patrick Sloyan hỏi các đồng nghiệp tại miền Đông xem có biết ai am hiểu Chế độ Ngô Đình Diệm vì ông muốn kiểm lại với những người trong chính quyền Diệm một số tin đã được giải mật. Sau đó ông bay qua gặp tôi tại quận Cam, được tôi giới thiệu với người trong cuộc là cụ Cao Xuân Vỹ và cả Huỳnh Văn Lang. Tôn Thất Đính được liên lạc mà lặn tăm! <br>Kết cuộc là cuốn “THE POLITICS OF DECEPTION: JFK&#39;s Secret Decisions on Vietnam, Civil Rights, and Cuba” xuất bản năm 2015!<br>Trong khi đó, phía Mỹ lại không nắm vững vai trò Trung Cộng như hậu phương lớn của Hà Nội, Johnson cứ tưởng dàn xếp với Liên Xô là xong! <br>ĐỐI THỦ CHÍNH CỦA MỸ LÀ TRUNG CỘNG<br>Là lãnh tụ Dân Chủ trong Quốc Hội, Johnson có một ưu tiên là xây dựng chế độ bao cấp của cánh tả (giấc mơ Great Society hay ‘Xã hội Đại đồng’) và có câu tuyên bố xanh dờn “Hai trăm năm nữa, bọn Đen (Niggers) sẽ còn bỏ phiếu cho chúng ta.” Vì vậy, Johnson gặp mâu thuẫn: làm sao kết thúc chiến tranh tại Việt Nam để còn lo chuyện xã hội tại Hoa Kỳ? Đâm ra từ 1964 tới 1968, Johnson vừa mở ra việc hòa đàm với Liên Xô về Việt Nam, vừa chứng tỏ là tôn trọng chủ trương chống cộng của Kennedy. <br>Về mặt chiến lược, Johnson còn coi thường quan điểm của tướng lãnh nên vẫn leo thang chiến tranh, nhưng lo hòa đàm để còn chạy. Trong khi đó, Bắc Kinh mới là hậu phương lớn của Hà Nội nên gây sức ép để Hà Nội từ chối việc hòa đàm có Liên Xô bên trong! Sau cùng chính Bắc Kinh thúc đẩy vụ Tổng tấn công vào dịp hưu chiến để ăn Tết Mậu Thân. Bắc Kinh muốn Hà Nội làm Mỹ bị tản lực trong chiến tranh để hết gây thêm khó khăn cho mình.<br>Tình báo Mỹ (CIA) tại Việt Nam có tin tức về mưu gian của Hà Nội vào Tết Mậu Thân nhưng đoán là Hà Nội sẽ thua, rồi kết luận vì biết sẽ thua, Hà Nội sẽ không tiến hành cuộc tổng tấn công! Nào ngờ Hà Nội vẫn ra lệnh tổng tấn công để tổng nổi dậy và bị tổn thất nặng. Nhưng thất bại quân sự của Hà Nội tại miền Nam lại là thắng lợi chính trị tại Mỹ làm Johnson mất tinh thần, hết tái tranh cử vào Tháng 11, 1968!<br>Hóa ra Hoa Kỳ không biết đối thủ của mình lại là Trung Cộng và Hà Nội bị xuất huyết chính là vì Bắc Kinh.<br>TRUNG CỘNG MUỐN GÌ TẠI VIỆT NAM…<br>Trung Cộng tốn kém rất nhiều tại Việt Nam vì mục tiêu gì? Nhìn lại thì khi đó, có thể Hoa Kỳ chưa biết, chứ ngày nay đã tỉnh giấc chứ? Nhưng cứ xem cách ứng xử của Donald Trump thì ta nên nghĩ rằng Mỹ vẫn còn mê!<br>Lãnh đạo Hoa Kỳ luôn luôn thiếu trưởng thành khi ứng xử với Trung Quốc, kể từ thời Franklin Roosevelt cho tới Harry Truman rồi chiến tranh Cao Ly 1950-1953 là một tiêu biểu. Đến nỗi khi can thiệp vào Việt Nam, Hoa Kỳ còn áp dụng kinh nghiệm trận địa chiến tại Cao Ly cho một hình thái chiến tranh toàn diện tại Việt Nam. Tức là đòi Việt Nam tổ chức lại quân đội cho một trận chiến mà Mỹ chưa nắm vững bản chất. Lại càng mơ hồ về đối thủ chính là Trung Cộng.<br>Chúng ta nên nhớ lại khác biệt giữa chủ nghĩa Marx và lý luận Lenin.<br>Sau khi chiếm được Hoa lục năm 1949, Mao Trạch Đông có HAI mục tiêu song hành. Mục tiêu thứ nhất thuộc về ý thức hệ là lãnh đạo phong trào giải phóng các nước nhược tiểu bị Âu Châu cai trị. Nhưng mục tiêu ý thức hệ kiểu Marx cũng hàm chứa lý luận đế quốc của Lenin: Bắc Kinh sẽ lãnh đạo một đế quốc mới để tìm lại thế lực văn hóa chính trị kiểu Đại Hán thời xa xưa. Muốn vậy phải làm hai đối thủ là Liên Xô và Hoa Kỳ hao tổn sức lực trong trận tranh đua với nhau.<br>Vì vậy, Mao giúp tổ chức Việt Minh thắng thực dân Pháp (1950-1954). <br>Vụ Điện Biên Phủ (tên gọi là theo ngữ pháp Tầu, chứ dân ta gọi là Phủ Điện Biên!) là thành tích của Mao khi cho Vị Quốc Thanh, Trần Canh và Lã Quý Ba tham dự cùng mấy trăm ngàn quân vào miền Bắc Việt Nam. Chính Vị Quốc Thanh cho Việt Minh kế hoạch hành quân của Tướng Henri Navarre để hoàn tất trận Điện Biên Phủ. Nhìn lại như vậy, người ta phải giật mình vì cùng lúc đó, Mao còn cho ‘chí nguyện quân’ mở ra Chiến tranh Cao Ly!<br>Sau này, Mao và Chu Ân Lai đều ân hận là chấp nhận việc chia đôi Việt Nam tại hiệp định Genève 1954 nên ráo riết yểm trợ Hà Nội mở ra cuộc chiến ở trong Nam. Từ 1965 đến 1968, Bắc Kinh có 320 ngàn lính tại Miền Bắc và thúc đẩy Hà Nội làm Hoa Kỳ thêm hao tốn phương tiện và nhân lực tại Đông Dương. Trong khi đó, Hoa Kỳ lại tìm lối thoát bằng cách vận động đàm phán với Liên Xô.<br>Sau thất bại của Chính quyền Johnson, khi đắc cử năm 1968, Tổng thống Richard Nixon bắt đầu hiểu ra và tìm cách tiếp xúc với Bắc Kinh từ 1970 để giảm bớt gánh nặng tại Việt Nam. Thật ra, mâu thuẫn giữa Liên Xô và Trung Cộng đã thành gay gắt ngay giữa cao điểm của nội loạn là cuộc Đại Văn Cách (Cách mạng Văn hóa Vô sản Vĩ đại 1967) nên chính Mao cần hợp tác với Mỹ. Nhưng tình báo và tay chân của Bắc Kinh tinh vi hơn Mỹ rất xa vì biết ý muốn của Nixon. Mà Nixon lại không biết! <br>Sau khi Henry Kissinger lén thăm Bắc Kinh để thu xếp chuyến Hoa du cho Nixon vào năm 1972 (năm có bầu cử Tổng thống Mỹ), Mao bắn tiếng cho ký giả Mỹ là Edgar Snow rằng Nghị sĩ Dân Chủ Edward Kennedy sắp qua Bắc Kinh! Nhu cầu tái tranh cử khiến Nixon lật đật làm đúng ý của Mao. <br>Sau cùng, Nixon hoàn tất việc tháo chạy khỏi Việt Nam, gọi là ‘hòa bình trong danh dự’ với Hiệp định Paris năm 1973 chấp nhận mọi yêu cầu của Hà Nội (tức là Bắc Kinh) từ năm 1968. Và lãnh đạo Hà Nội khi đó là Lê Duẩn tưởng mình đại thắng mà khỏi cần Bắc Kinh, lại còn muốn làm trung gian hòa giải giữa hai nước cộng sản đàn anh nên Bắc Kinh giở thói côn đồ năm 1979 để cho Hà Nội một bài học. <br>Thật ra, chính là việc Hà Nội ngả theo Liên Xô mới là yếu tố quyết định. Và Hà Nội còn thi hành ‘nghĩa vụ quốc tế’ là cho quân chiếm đóng xứ Kampuchia làm chiến tranh kéo dài thêm chục năm sau 1975! Đến khi Liên Xô suy sụp rồi tan rã, sau 1991 Hà Nội mới tiến hành ‘đổi mới thật’ - là cứ làm theo Bắc Kinh.<br>Nhưng chủ quyền Việt Nam đã tiêu vong vì làm gì tính gì cũng ngó xem Bắc Kinh tính sao, có đồng ý hay không!<br>Nói cho đúng, Việt Nam gây cảnh tương tàn từ 1945 cho tới sau này, và ngày nay vẫn nằm trong bàn tay Bắc Kinh: hóa ra lãnh đạo Hà Nội đã tự Hán hóa đến tận cùng. <br>Trong một chuyến công tác cho doanh nghiệp Hoa Kỳ tại Hà Nội, tôi có được gặp ông Nguyễn Cơ Thạch trong một dự án đại học dân lập. Khi đứng ngoài thềm của Nhà Hữu nghị đợi xe hơi, ông Thạch nói nhỏ: ‘không thể làm nhanh được. Tôi đi nhanh quá nên đứng ở đây’… Ông bị Bắc Kinh yêu cầu Bộ Chính trị tại Hà Nội gạt ra ngoài.<br>Mà có lẽ Hoa Kỳ cũng chưa rút tỉa được bài học ê chề khi dính vào các cuộc chiến mà chẳng rõ bản chất - và dọc đường còn đổi mục tiêu! </td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R173" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">174</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/27/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">KONSTANTIN KISIN DẠY LÃNH ĐẠO MỸ VỀ PUTIN!<br>Sinh tại Nga vào ngày Giáng Sinh 1982, Konstantin Kisin đã thành nghệ sĩ, danh hài có tài châm biến và bình luận gia tại Anh, với substack của mình. Am hiểu lịch sử Nga (với ảnh hưởng sâu xa của Mông Cổ!) và theo dõi bước chân Putin, Kisin kể lại nhiều thành tích của tên đồ tể và sự ngây ngô của lãnh đạo Tây phương. Nhất là sự đần độn của Trump ngày nay. Tôi rất mê cuốn AN IMMIGRANT’S LOVE LETTER TO THE WEST do Kisin xuất bản năm 2022 vì học được nhiều, rồi từ đó yểm trở và theo dõi từng bài viết của ông…<br>Bài này là một thí dụ mà chúng ta nên đọc và nhớ!<br>https://www.konstantinkisin.com/.../why-americans-dont...<br>Why Americans Don&#39;t Understand Vladimir Putin<br>(By Konstantin Kisin - May 26, 2025) ∙ Paid<br>Prompted by a wave of missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities which killed 12 and injured dozens over the weekend, President Trump expressed his frustrations with Vladimir Putin on Monday, saying “I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!”<br>This is an interesting theory. Before we examine it in detail, it is worth pointing out that numerous US Presidents have attempted to believe it. President George W. Bush famously “looked into Putin’s eyes and saw a soul”, while Bill Clinton insisted that Putin could be relied on to stick to their agreements. US Presidents prefer (or at least pretend) to believe this because it prevents them from having to face the reality of who Vladimir Putin has always been, and what that means for America and the West. But, far more importantly, I think this belief is also a product of the American psyche, which makes even the most cynical US politicians susceptible to manipulation by those who operate within a different moral framework.<br>Regular readers will know that you will not find a bigger fan of the United States than me. Spending time in the US is always a joy - one cannot help but be inspired by the culture of openness, cooperation and positivity. The story of America is that anything is possible, especially when good people get together to do business, make money and thrive. While most Americans take these cultural traits as given, the reality is they are rare and, in no small part, the foundation of America’s success. Americans are widely regarded around the world as extremely friendly, welcoming, proactive and constructive.<br>But every coin has two sides. The trade-off of this business-focused, open-minded, good-faith, let’s-make-money approach is a consistent failure to contend with the reality that not all cultures and not all people are like this.<br>My Western friends often say that I come across as “intense”, “unsmiling” and even “angry” in interviews. By American standards they are certainly right. Which is why they are always surprised when I tell them the story of showing a Russian family member a school photo of mine. “Why have you all got that idiotic American smile?” she asked.<br>The open, welcoming and positive attitude that is the default setting in America is widely regarded in many parts of the world as evidence of gullibility, unseriousness and naivety. It is seen, sometimes justifiably, as an attitude that leaves people vulnerable to deception. Not because Americans are stupid, but because their desire to believe in the good of others makes it harder for them to recognise when others are not, in fact, good.<br>To fully grasp the cultural chasm between Russia and America, you need to understand history.<br>The United States is a nation of people who conquered a continent. It is filled with the descendants of those who left their homelands to seek a better life on the other side of the world. Facing immense hardships, they did not just overcome, they triumphed. In a few centuries, successive waves of newcomers banded together to build a nation out of nothing through hard work, a go-get-it mentality and a high-trust, collaborative society. Americans have no genetic memory of being invaded by powerful enemies, of being held down and oppressed by foreign conquerors, of mass persecution or extermination by their own governments, of totalitarianism, of famine, of failure. The American ethos is defined by overcoming the challenges the country has faced in its history: the Great Depression was merely a precursor to the country’s explosion into an economic and manufacturing superpower. Pearl Harbour was followed not only by overwhelming victory in WWII but by America emerging as the world’s dominant nation and the centre of Western civilisation.<br>Anything is possible, problems are challenges to be solved and the future is bright.<br>Now consider the history of Russia. One of the founding experiences of the Russian nation is being occupied by the Mongols. The descendants of Genghis Khan wiped out anyone who resisted and subjugated everyone else. If you are struggling to understand what this meant, imagine your country is invaded by ISIS or Khal Drogo from Game of Thrones. They butcher, rape and torture their way through every major city. They force everyone else to bend the knee.<br>In Russian, this period is called the “Tatar-Mongol Yoke”, a yoke being a device used to join two work animals, such as oxen, together to pull a load.<br>This period of time lasted around 240 years, as long as the entire history of the United States. To this day, the Russian language contains many Mongolian words, especially those related to taxation, weaponry and war.<br>Another formative period in Russian history is called Smuta, or Times of Trouble. Ivan the Terrible, infamous for killing his only viable heir in a fit of rage, passed on his crown to a feeble and incapable son, Feodor. When Feodor died without an heir, Russia was thrust into 15 years of chaos in which a succession of usurpers and false claimants battled over the throne. Combined with famine, disease and a series of foreign invasions, the Times of Trouble saw at least a third of Russia’s population wiped out in just fifteen years. One of the key conclusions Russians drew from this is that whatever else he is, a ruler must be strong to maintain order. A weak ruler leads to chaos. And chaos is to be avoided at any cost.<br>How poorly this is understood in the West is ironically and perfectly encapsulated in the different names Russians and English-speakers have for Ivan the Terrible. The word “terrible” is a telling mistranslation: his moniker in Russian is much more accurately translated as “Fearsome”.<br>In the centuries since, Russia has been repeatedly invaded by its Western neighbors including the Swedes, Lithuanians, Poles, Finns and, famously, Napoleon and Hitler. While these attacks were ultimately repelled, they left deep scars in the Russian psyche. There is little triumphalism about defeating Napoleon, whose invasion saw Moscow burned to the ground. And while victory in the Great Patriotic War, the Russian name for WWII, is much celebrated, it came at the cost of around 20 million lives. For contrast, the United States lost just over 400,000 people in the same conflict.<br>Compare also the revolutions and civil wars which took place in the two countries. The Russian Revolution which sparked the Russian Civil War resulted in the installation of a tyrannical, murderous communist regime which exterminated its enemies, expropriated private property, and instituted a decades-long reign of terror ending in economic collapse and Cold War defeat in 1991. Meanwhile the American Revolution is a story of a successful fight for independence, while the American Civil War, although bloody and painful, is seen as the price of progress on the path to ultimate unification.<br>While American baby boomers lived through a period of economic expansion, success and triumph, their Russian counterparts - like Putin, born in 1952 - grew up in the aftermath of a devastating war, Stalin’s slave labour camps, and economic stagnation. By the time they were in their prime, their country collapsed all around them creating chaos, instability and a sense of loss, humiliation and exploitation.<br>These historical experiences inevitably produce people who see the world through such different lenses that it might as well be a different world. Centuries of pain, poverty, famine, war, brutality, suspicion and humiliation do not produce happy, smiling, positive go-getters.<br>Which brings us back to the claim that the normally reasonable, rational and pragmatic Vladimir Putin with whom we can do business has suddenly become a different person and gone “CRAZY”. This claim is convenient for a number of reasons.<br>First, it absolves those who have been claiming he is reasonable, rational and pragmatic while his troops have been butchering civilians, stealing Ukrainian children and torturing PoWs in captivity.<br>Second, it justifies the foreign policy of turning a blind eye to the reality of Putin’s Russia and the man himself. On social media, Americans often accuse me of being a Putin “hater” for stating basic facts about his career history and the regime he has set up in Russia. These facts are worth restating.<br>Vladimir Putin is a former officer of the KGB, the Soviet Union’s main intelligence and security agency. The agency was the successor to the Cheka and NKVD, which were the tools used by Stalin and other Soviet leaders to murder and imprison dissidents, domestic critics and foreign defectors. He joined the agency long after its crimes under Stalin had been exposed.<br>Vladimir Putin has never been elected in a free and fair election. He was effectively handed the presidency in 1999 by his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, in exchange for protection, and has held onto power for 26 years, ending Russia’s brief experiment with democracy. Every single one of his political opponents like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Boris Nemtsov, Aleksey Navalny, and Gary Kasparov is dead, imprisoned, or in exile.<br>In 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, Putin lied repeatedly that the soldiers without insignia who had taken over the peninsula were not his, saying with a cunning grin that “you can go to a store and buy any kind of uniform.” He later handed out medals to the Russian soldiers involved in the operation.<br>Since the war in Ukraine started, Putin has cleaned house with both liberal and nationalist critics, who have been imprisoned like Igor Girkin-Strelkov or assassinated like Yevgeny Prigozhin.<br>My point is: to anyone who understands the reality of Putin’s regime, the idea that he has “gone CRAZY” and is killing people is…well, CRAZY. Vladimir Putin is in power and retains power precisely because he has always been someone who is prepared to lie, manipulate and kill to achieve his objectives. That is literally what the KGB trained him to do.<br>In his post criticising Putin, Trump went on to add: “I’ve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that’s proving to be right”. Finally, it seems, our American friends are beginning to understand who they are dealing with.<br>In his Long Telegram, George Kennan famously wrote that Russia was “impervious to logic of reason and highly sensitive to logic of force.” This is why I had high - and so far, false - hopes for Trump’s ability to end the war. I assumed he would understand the obvious: that bringing Putin to the negotiating table would require a carrot and a stick.<br>So far, dangling only the carrot of “ending the killing” and sending a starry-eyed historically and geographically illiterate lawyer to be bamboozled for hours in the Kremlin has, predictably, produced nothing. The only way Trump will get serious negotiations going is to threaten Putin with ramping up not only sanctions but high grade, extensive military aid to Ukraine.<br>As long as that option is not on the table, Putin will keep calling America’s bluff.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R174" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">175</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/27/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">FENTANYL TRÊN CẢ HAI BỜ VĨ TUYẾN!<br>Hôm nay, một cựu sĩ quan của lực lượng Cảnh sát Kỵ binh Hoàng gia Canada (Royal Canada Mounted Police) trình bày sự thể kinh hoàng trên cả hai bờ Bắc Nam của Vĩ tuyến 49 nối liền Canada với Hoa Kỳ: Tay chân của đảng Cộng sản Trung Quốc (CCP) cộng tác cùng tổ chức tội ác Mexico để phát triển việc phổ biến độc dược Fentanyl -trước sự thờ ơ của Chính quyền Ottawa!<br>https://www.thebureau.news/.../bordered-by-denial-ottawas...<br>Bordered by Denial: Ottawa’s Inaction as Canada Becomes a Fentanyl Source State<br>As CCP-backed networks and Mexican cartels exploit Canadian labs and border weaknesses, Ottawa stalls, the RCMP falters, and the consequences escalate on both sides of the 49th parallel.<br>(By Garry Clement - The Bureau - May 26, 2025)<br>OTTAWA — Canada is facing a dual crisis - one at its borders, and another at the core of its national police force. While Prime Minister Mark Carney hesitates to act decisively against cartel and Chinese Communist Party-backed network incursions flooding the northern frontier, the RCMP remains trapped in a years-long credibility crisis marked by failed leadership, politicized decision-making, and questionable surveillance practices. Together, these failures endanger not only Canada’s domestic security but its strategic partnership with the United States.<br>In the face of unprecedented cartel activity, Ottawa has responded with symbolism rather than substance. As the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels shift operations northward, Canada has emerged as a critical source of fentanyl flooding international markets, including the United States. The Canada Border Services Agency has identified Canada as a fentanyl exporter nation. “The fentanyl threat in Canada has definitely shifted from one of importation to one of domestic production,” RCMP Inspector James Cooke told CBC News a year ago, in August 2024.<br>That report added that Eric Hrab, a detective with the Hamilton Police intelligence unit, said fentanyl production has taken off in Canada in part because some precursors can be obtained domestically - while the ingredients needed to make cocaine or opium can only be found in certain climates.<br>While border seizure statistics fail to capture the full extent of trafficking from Canadian lab networks, multiple government reports show fentanyl-related seizures along the northern border have surged - rising between 300 and over 1,000 percent in recent years, depending on the agency and reporting period. Human smuggling is up more than 200 percent, and cartel-linked violence is now increasingly visible in U.S. borderland cities such as Detroit and Buffalo.<br>Despite these alarming trends, Canada’s response has been tepid: delayed terrorist designations, minimal investment in border infrastructure, and silence from Carney on the issue.<br>While the recent announcement to provide 1,000 more RCMP officers and introduce stronger bail conditions may appear bold, it overlooks the crippling impact of the Jordan and Stinchcombe decisions. Without confronting these judicial constraints, investigations into transnational organized crime will continue to be hamstrung.<br>This silence is not just inaction; it is political deflection in its most dangerous form. Even as U.S. intelligence officials ring alarm bells and impose retaliatory tariffs, Ottawa has failed to develop a coherent strategy. The RCMP, already overstretched, is expected to fill the vacuum - yet it is an institution in disarray, crippled by years of leadership dysfunction.<br>From the mass shooting in Portapique to the controversial use of investigative tools like ODITS (Overt and Discreet Investigative Techniques), the RCMP has consistently demonstrated systemic shortcomings. The Portapique inquiry exposed a breakdown in command and communication, where brave front-line officers were left unsupported and senior officials dodged accountability. Instead of addressing these failures, the force doubled down on internal cronyism and a punitive management culture.<br>The leadership culture at the RCMP has become deeply toxic. Promotions are handed out not on merit, but on loyalty to a narrow elite. Whistleblowers are marginalized, dissent is silenced, and technological tools meant for public safety are reportedly used against internal critics. The deployment of ODITS in internal probes - including against individuals only tangentially linked to active investigations - raises urgent civil liberties concerns. Where is the oversight? Where are the checks and balances?<br>This broken system is now tasked with confronting some of the most dangerous criminal organizations in the world. Expecting the RCMP to rise to that challenge while it crumbles under its own internal contradictions is not just naïve - it is reckless.<br>Fixing this requires more than border announcements and bureaucratic reshuffles. It demands an overhaul of leadership accountability in the RCMP and a real security partnership with the United States - one that includes intelligence sharing, joint operations, and investment in surveillance infrastructure along the northern border. Canada must also implement independent oversight of surveillance practices and end the culture of impunity that infects the upper echelons of its police institutions.<br>The time has come for Prime Minister Carney to break his silence and lead. Political slogans and climate platitudes will not stop the flow of fentanyl, nor will they reform an RCMP hollowed out by years of internal decay. Canadians and Americans alike are watching - and what they see now is a nation asleep at the wheel, as organized crime drives across a barely guarded northern frontier.<br>Canada deserves better. It deserves a government and a police force willing to confront uncomfortable truths and act in defense of the public good.<br>That time is now.<br>---<br>¹ In fiscal year 2023–2024, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) reported a 775% increase in fentanyl seizures compared to the previous year, with a total of 4.9 kilograms interdicted. The agency also logged more than 35,000 seizures of drugs and precursor chemicals across Canada. Separately, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data show fentanyl seizures at the northern border rose from 2 pounds in 2023 to 43 pounds in 2024 - a more than 2,000% increase - further underscoring the rapid rise in trafficking pressure along the U.S.–Canada corridor. US government sources indicate though, that CBP seizure data doesn&#39;t include inland seizures from numerous American agencies tackling fentanyl emanating from Canadian-based networks.<br>Sources: Government of Canada – CBSA, “2024 Year in Review” (Dec. 21, 2024); U.S. CBP data, via FactCheck.org (Jan. 2025).</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R175" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">176</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/27/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">HOA KỲ LÂM CHIẾN VÀ ĐẠI BẠI TẠI VIỆT NAM <br>Sau phần nhập môn, hôm nay 26/5 ta sẽ lần lượt tìm hiểu thêm, và phải dụ thế này để cho biết trước vài tiết mục nhức óc… người Mỹ<br>1/ Tổng thống Lyndon B.

The first one is, how can we understand the Great Holocene Transformation - a dramatic increase in the scale and complexity of human societies during the Holocene (roughly, the last 10,000 years)? A book presenting an extended answer to this question (based on dynamic models and analysis of the Seshat Databank) will be published in September.<br>The second big question stems from the observation that complex human societies organized as states, for a while, can experience periods of high internal peace and order, roughly a century long. Eventually - and seemingly inevitably - they then enter periods of high social unrest and political disintegration, “End Times.” Why this happens was, of course, the main question in my most recent popular book. But now I want to understand how societies end such end times, and what we can learn to navigate our own society safely through the shoals of instability and conflict.<br>One thing we learned from the analysis of historical data is that once a society steps on the road to crisis, it resembles a massive ball rolling down a narrow valley with steep slopes. It’s very difficult to stop or even deflect its rush to an impending disaster. But once the ball arrives at the crisis point, the valley opens up - there are many ways to exit the crisis. Some paths lead to a complete disaster and utter collapse. Other trajectories manage to avoid the bloodshed of a revolution or a civil war.<br>Trajectories of societies entering into crisis are strongly constrained, like the stem of a gingko leaf. But there are many ways to exit from crisis, from relatively mild to catastrophic.<br>Most exits from crisis, however, have to pass through a lengthy period of disintegration and disunity - lasting many decades and sometimes longer than a century. An example is the early modern crisis in France, which began in 1562 with the Wars of Religion and ended with the start of Louis XIV’s personal rule in 1661. We can quibble with the precise dating of this disintegrative period, for example, dating its start to the Tumult of Amboise (1560), or dating the end to the end of the Fronde (1653), but either way the duration would be multiple decades.<br>Not only disintegrative phase durations are highly variable, their outcomes are also highly variable and appear to be unpredictable. It turns out that at the cusp of the crisis the massive ball of the state can be nudged to achieve better outcomes. This insight is of high relevance to us today, seeing that we - again - got ourselves into end times.<br>How did past societies end their disintegrative periods? A critical step is reversing the root cause of crisis - the perverse wealth pump that takes from the common people and gives to the elites. As described in End Times, good times breed complacency among the governing elites. During integrative phases they become tempted to rejiggle the political economy in ways that benefit themselves at the expense of the workers. As a result, worker wages stagnate and even decline, and the fruits of economic growth go disproportionately to the elites. The operation of this wealth pump results in popular immiseration and discontent, elite overproduction and intraelite conflict, and gradual weakening of the state. As these negative trends build up (which typically takes multiple decades), they eventually drive society into crisis. Exiting the crisis requires reversing these negative trends, which means, first and foremost, shutting down the wealth pump.<br>But accomplishing this feat is not easy. The problem is that the wealth pump is extremely lucrative for the ruling class. Sociologists refer to this tendency of the ruling elites to use their power for selfish ends as the Iron Law of Oligarchy. In short, power corrupts.<br>How can the oligarchs be persuaded to give up their selfish advantage in favor of promoting public weal? In most run-ups to past crises, in fact, ruling classes refused the calls to reform, persisting in their intransigence to the very end. And the end, usually, was their violent overthrow by counter-elites channeling popular rage against their regime. Or they weaken the state to the point where it is conquered by external elites, as happened when the Manchus took over Ming Dynasty’s China.<br>Since an external conquest of the US (or European Union) is unlikely (and thank God for that), my main interest is in how past societies solved their problems by internal means. My working hypothesis is that at the cusp of crisis, the ball of state can be nudged to achieve better outcomes, and that is when individuals can play a significant role. Not sole individuals, but rather groups such as parties, factions, or social movements, as well as their leaders.<br>Consider a lengthy disintegrative phase, such as the Age of Revolutions in France. Between 1789 and 1870 France experienced Great Revolution, Napoleon’s coup and First Empire, a catastrophic military defeat, Bourbon Restoration, Revolutions of 1830 and of 1848, Second Empire, another catastrophic defeat, and Paris Commune. Repeatedly, one group of elites was overthrown by counterelites, who became ruling elites, and were then, in turn, overthrown by another set of counterelites.<br>To achieve success in these struggles, a power network needs, first, to seize and hold power. But that’s not enough. If it is unable to resolve the deep structural issues that drove the society into crisis, this power group will be overthrown after some time. Thus, success in the long term requires both the ability to gain and hold power in competition against other power networks and implement a program of reforms that reverse the structural-demographic trends that brought the society into its disintegrative phase.<br>At this point, this all is just developing the theory and formulating hypotheses. The next and critical step is how do we empirically test these ideas?</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R178" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">179</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/25/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">NHỮNG CHUYỆN ĐÁNG NHỚ…<br>Tờ The Free Press có tiết mục tuyệt vời là ‘những chuyện đáng nhớ’, hôm nay còn đáng nhớ hơn vì trước ngày “Chiến Sĩ Trận Vong” của nước Mỹ mà chúng ta nên đọc.<br>Rồi ngừng lại bần thần.... <br>Việt Nam có bao trận chiến trong Thế kỷ 20 mà 25 năm sau khi đã qua Thế kỷ 21 chưa hề có một lễ tưởng niệm những người đã tử trận, thuộc phe này, đảng nọ hay miền kia!

Sullivan Ballou did too, and his words are a reminder of what Memorial Day is about.<br>(By Elliot Ackerman - The Free Press - 05.25.25 - Things Worth Remembering)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Welcome to “Things Worth Remembering,” in which writers share a poem or a paragraph that all of us should commit to heart. This week, to mark Memorial Day, former Marine Elliot Ackerman reflects on a letter written by a soldier who never came home. His words remind us of the best way to honor the dead.<br>***<br>Of all American holidays, Memorial Day is beset by the most contradictions. Officially, it is a somber holiday, one where we honor our country’s war dead, but it is also the holiday that marks the unofficial beginning of summer. Over this long weekend, many of us will pull out our barbecues, or travel to our local beach, or check out the latest blockbuster. I grew up in a religious household and, for me, Memorial Day weekend meant it was the one Sunday I didn’t have to go to church; the Indy 500 was on, and I was allowed to watch the race with my dad.<br>Then I joined the Marines, and fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. After that, Memorial Day took on a different, more specific meaning for me. In the early years, I’d spend the day visiting the graves of friends buried at Arlington.<br>Many Americans don’t have any personal ties to our war dead, and so the remembrance part of Memorial Day is, for them, an abstraction. The first-ever Memorial Day was anything but abstract. It was celebrated in 1868, three years after the Civil War, a national bloodletting that killed one out of every 50 Americans. Back then, everyone knew someone lost in the war. The original idea was simple: The day would be used to decorate the graves of the fallen. It was proposed by John Logan, a retired Union officer, who understood how important it was to the dead that they not be forgotten. The truth is, anyone who has fought in a war, and had the good fortune to survive, understands this - because all of us have imagined our own deaths.<br>Like countless others before me, I knew that, in the event I was killed, I wanted to have one last word with the people I loved. So I wrote a few letters, hid them, and told my best friend from high school where they were in case anything happened. Fortunately, they were never opened. Today, they sit in a drawer with some mementos from the war. My father, who one of the letters was addressed to, has since passed away. My children, who were then unborn, have no letters addressed to them. The letters are from a different time, as if written by a different person. I doubt I’ll ever open them.<br>The practice of writing a “death letter” is as old as war itself. In the summer of 1861, Sullivan Ballou, a 32-year-old Union major in the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry Regiment, wrote one such letter to his wife on July 14, one week before the First Battle of Bull Run. If you’re wondering how to remember the dead this Memorial Day, I recommend you spend a moment with this letter. It begins:<br>    My very dear Sarah,<br>&quot;The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days -perhaps to-morrow. Lest I should not be able to write again, I feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more . . .<br>Military life is filled with movement. You are never in one place long, and the days before a battle are often frenetic, as pieces are put in place for one great effort against the enemy. If you love a soldier, part of waiting for them is living with uncertainty. You never know exactly where they are or what they’re doing.<br>When I read the opening of this letter, I imagine how much Sullivan and Sarah’s life had changed in the past six months. Before the war, Ballou was an attorney. Losing his father at an early age, he had attended Brown University for two years, before establishing himself as a lawyer. He had married Sarah Hart Shumway six years before, on October 15, 1855, and they had started a family. When war came, she was in her mid-twenties, and they shared two sons, Edgar and William.<br>Then, in April 1861, after the bombing of Fort Sumter, Lincoln called for volunteers. Ballou answered that call, left his family, and took up life as a soldier with the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry. Listening to his stridency in the next paragraph of the letter, I can almost imagine their conversations as he made his decision to join:<br>    If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for any country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing, perfectly willing to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.<br>In Iraq and Afghanistan, our cause was rarely so clearly articulated. It was the same for the American wars that preceded mine, in Vietnam and Korea. To hear a voice from the past speak with such clarity about his cause gives us a view into a very different America. In my wars, we fought for myriad reasons: for each other; because we were professionals; or because we loved soldiering and couldn’t imagine or didn’t want a life outside the military. I can’t remember ever hearing someone say the reason they were willing to lay down their life was for any “Government” whether it be Iraqi, Afghan, or even American.<br>Country, yes. Each other, yes. But not the government.<br>Willingness to make such a sacrifice is never simple. I deployed five times to Iraq and Afghanistan. My last nights in the U.S. before leaving were some of the longest of my life and they never got easier. I both did and didn’t want to go. That tension - between obligations at home and a desire to go - is as old as war. Ballou must have felt that acutely when he left home and began his long march south. In his letter, he writes to Sarah of his ambivalence, as well as its source: his love of her.<br>    Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables, that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet, my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield . . .<br>By my final deployment, I had become a father. The firebase where I stayed was pretty comfortable. I had internet in my room. Many nights, I would Skype with my infant daughter. Often, I would listen to her laugh, and try to get her to say “Daddy,” while my helmet, body armor, and assault rifle sat in the corner, just out of the video’s frame, ready for later that night, when I would go on a raid with the Afghan special operations unit I advised. As I logged off Skype, I couldn’t help but wonder if that call would be the last time I spoke to her. In Ballou’s letter, he is clearly wrestling with similar emotions. What will Sarah’s life be like without him? What will be left for her and the children to hold onto?<br>    Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and how foolish I have often times been!... But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the gladdest days and in the darkest nights... always, always; and, if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath, or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.<br>Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.<br>Sullivan Ballou was killed a week later at the First Battle of Bull Run. Sarah Ballou never remarried. She lived another 55 years after her husband’s death. She died in 1917, and is buried next to him.<br>Sullivan Ballou and I are separated by centuries. He lived in a country I scarcely recognize. But what I understand is the letter he wrote, one that seeks to reach across time, across the barrier between life and death, one that would allow him to continue living in the memories of those he left behind. It is a reminder that Memorial Day is not only for those who died, but also those who go on living without them. Ballou’s letter isn’t about death; it’s about life: the “soft breeze” on Sarah’s cheek; “the cool air” on her temple.<br>Years ago, an old friend of mine was killed in Afghanistan. He left behind a wife and three children. We had fought alongside one another on an earlier deployment, and I learned that, in a letter he’d left behind, he’d asked that I deliver a eulogy at his funeral. As I struggled to write it, my wife said, “You know who the eulogy is for, don’t you?”<br>I didn’t say anything. I realized that I didn’t know.<br>She told me: “It’s for the children.”<br>These days, my family spends Memorial Day weekend with an old Marine buddy, who also fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his family. This weekend, we’ll be doing the same as so many other American families: barbecuing with the kids, and going down to the beach. But, in between, we’ll tell stories about old friends. The gunnery sergeant whose nickname was Moshpit. The captain who lived out of his truck and dated a Swedish track star. These stories are never really about combat, or death, but mostly about what a group of characters these guys were, and when our kids laugh at these stories those friends seem to live again.<br>So please go to the beach, watch the blockbuster, have that barbecue. Remember the dead. And then live, for them; that is what they fought for.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R179" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">180</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/25/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỸ ƠI, LẠI HỤT TIN NÀY… NỮA SAO?<br>Ôi Đê Mê Giáo Chủ khi thủ sai nơi và đánh lầm chỗ, như mọi khi....<br>https://www.theepochtimes.com/.../as-chinas-economy...<br>In-Depth - Premium Reports<br>As China’s Economy Weakens, Tens of Thousands of Workers Protest Against Unpaid Wages<br>Several workers told The Epoch Times their factories were abruptly shut down recently, while others say they have not been paid for months.<br>As China’s Economy Weakens, Tens of Thousands of Workers Protest Against Unpaid Wages<br>Employees across multiple sectors in China launched dozens of protests in April and early May, demanding unpaid wages and benefits.

Last. Time.<br>By LaFave, Kenneth - War of the Words - May 26, 2025<br>Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard and an illustration of his clown parable<br>If I hear one more person say, “You’re not a scientist, and only scientists can make judgements about science” or the related “You’re not a doctor, and only doctors can make medical decisions,” I will give up on the human race.<br>Three things out of the chute:<br>1/ People who talk like this never stop to think, “Scientists disagree among themselves on scientific matters”; or “Different doctors have varied ways of looking at health issues, and come to different conclusions.”<br>2/ Since different scientists make different and often conflicting scientific observations, and as doctors will often arrive at opposite ends of a medical controversy, it logically follows that “only scientists can make judgements about science” and “only doctors can make medical decisions” are insufficient claims. Which scientists? Which doctors? And it then follows that people must make a decision as to which scientists and doctors to believe. But wait….<br>3/  You just said we can’t make judgements about science, because we are not scientists, nor can we make medical decisions because we are not doctors. If you are following my line of reasoning I will not have to point out that this means we cannot believe any scientific or medical claim. If we believe Scientist A over Scientist B, we are guilty of making a scientific judgement that we have no business making. Ditto choosing Doctor A’s medical opinion over Doctor B’s. <br>What usually happens next is that intellectual “democracy” takes over. Truth becomes a numbers game, or worse yet, a political strategy. I remember during the height of the so-called COVID pandemic - and a strong case can be made that there wasn’t one -  that a certain online acquaintance sniffed at my documented assertion that a group of some 30,000 medical professionals disagreed with the need for and averred safety of the mRNA “vaccine.” He responded with both the numbers game and the political strategy, saying that “many more thousands of doctors” found the “vaccine” safe and necessary, and that, anyway, the group of 30,000 I cited were “right-wingers.”<br>A non-medical professional, he nonetheless made (in his firm belief) a legitimate medical judgement, whereas my judgement was wrong. I was out-voted and deemed politically incorrect. Neither of his arguments was actually a medical argument, but I doubt he realized that.<br>Reliance on “experts” for the truth and the accompanying refusal to believe assertions from the “wrong sort” is a nightmarish danger to human freedom. The 19th-century Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard knew this and fashioned a parable that dramatically illustrates it:<br>“A fire broke out backstage in a theatre. The clown came out to warn the public; they thought it was a joke and applauded. He repeated it; the acclaim was even greater. I think that&#39;s just how the world will come to an end: to general applause from wits who believe it&#39;s a joke.”<br>The audience ignored the clown because… he was just a clown. They laughed instead of leaving. Had the theater owner come forth to warn them, they would have believed him, fled the theater and saved their lives. But a clown? The next, unwritten scene in the tale is obvious: the fire bursts through the curtain and into the theater, killing nearly everyone. Kierkegaard points to this as an image of the end of the world, with “general applause from wits who believe it’s a joke.” The “wits” will not take seriously any information from a clown. Whether the information is true or not doesn’t matter to them, only the pedigree of the source. The creator of the above image wrote the words “social media” across the stage, identifying alternative news sources as today’s equivalent of the clown.<br>When President Trump, whom today’s “wits” would doubtlessly call a clown when not labeling him a Nazi, shares evidence of white genocide in South Africa, the “wits” laugh, preferring to believe The New York Times (a stand-in for the theatre owner, who in Kierkegaard’s parable must have escaped out the back, and to hell with the audience) when it says the claim is false. Truth is not the issue for them. Pedigree is the point.<br>But truth knows no pedigree. It is whatever the truth is, whether it comes from a clown or social media or a president or anywhere or anybody at all. Each individual must make up his/her mind about what it is. You don’t have to be a scientist to consider the issue of global warming. Research the data and come to an informed conclusion. You don’t have to be a medical professional to question the overall efficacy of today’s phalanx of vaccinations, or to demand adequate testing of new vaccines. Research and weigh the evidence. Reliance on a consensus of “experts” is irrational. Reality does not conform to consensus.<br>By the way, I assume that most if not all of you have opinions about music. But what right do you have with musical opinions if you’re not a musician, hmm?<br>You may think that’s different from “only scientists can make judgements about science.” It’s not.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R182" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">183</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/25/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">HOA KỲ LÂM CHIẾN VÀ ĐẠI BẠI TẠI VIỆT NAM <br>(I) CHỦ NGHĨA LENIN HIỆN ĐẠI HÓA<br>Cuộc chiến của Hoa Kỳ tại Việt Nam là thảm kịch ghê gớm nhất cho người Việt trong Thế kỷ XX và là mối nhục cho nước Mỹ. Nhưng bi đát hơn cả là lắm người Mỹ còn chưa hiểu tại sao nên vẫn tái phạm sai lầm cũ. Vì thời lượng có hạn, tiểu luận này tập trung vào yếu tố Hoa Kỳ, chứ không thể đề cập tới nhiều khía cạnh rộng lớn khác… <br>Nhưng trước hết, xin ngàn chữ nhập môn để nói về thực tại mà bao người Mỹ lại chưa rõ: hiện đại hóa tư tưởng Lenin<br>VÀI KHÁI NIỆM NHẬP MÔN:<br>Đã viết quá nhiều lần, xin tóm lược là người viết sinh tại Hà Nội, di cư vào Nam trước khi lên 10 và rất hãnh diện là ‘người miền Nam’ trước và sau biến cố 1975. Học được nhiều điều tại miền Nam trong thời chiến và sau 1975, lại học thêm khi thấy nước nhà ‘xây dựng xã hội chủ nghĩa’ trong thực tế mà có lẽ đa số vẫn chưa hiểu vì… tự vựng. <br>Chữ ‘xây dựng’ không hàm ý tích cực hay tốt đẹp như ta có thể hiểu vì chính người cộng sản còn chưa rõ xã hội chủ nghĩa là gì, nói chi đến cộng sản chủ nghĩa. Họ được học tập như con vẹt là phải xóa hết tất cả những gì không thuộc xã hội chủ nghĩa, rồi gọi tiến trình đó là ‘cải tạo’, cũng với hàm nghĩa tích cực mà thực tế thì có nhiều dạng bi đát lẫn khôi hài vì chửi cha trí tuệ của dân tộc! <br>Kế tiếp, sau khi ‘xây dựng xã hội chủ nghĩa” đến tan hoang thì đảng đổi mới, với khẩu hiệu ‘bảo vệ xã hội chủ nghĩa’, bằng cách nới lỏng ách chuyên chính cho dân dễ thở mà lao động cho đảng trưng thu. Thành phần sớm thấy triệu chứng khủng hoảng chính là giới mật vụ công an, nên họ bước vào hàng ngũ lãnh đạo: từ Yuri Andropv đã cho Michael Gorbachev lên cầm quyền, tới đồng chí con cháu Tô Định ở Hà Nội ngày nay. Người thấy trước tiên chính là... Vladimir Lenin, ngay từ 1921 với Chánh sách Kinh Tế Mới (NEP)!<br>Sau đó nếu nước nhà có gì hay thì là nhờ đảng, dù nhiều xứ khác đã thực hiện từ lâu mà ít phao phí về phương tiện, cả máu xương, tiền của và nhất là thời gian: cái đã mất là mất luôn!<br>Và người Việt ngày nay tiếp tục lạc hậu nếu duy trì cái dốt về không gian lẫn thời gian: về không gian thì thua kém các nước lân cận. Về thời gian thì đáng lẽ phải thấy ra và thực hiện sớm hơn cho người dân.<br>Bây giờ, xin nhìn qua nước Mỹ. <br>Hoa Kỳ là quốc gia kỳ diệu, sau khi độc lập thì thành hình từ một khái niệm chính trị và giàu mạnh trên một lãnh thổ vuông vức. Khác với hầu hết các nước, quốc gia này còn kỳ diệu vì không kính nể thành phần xã hội làm trong chính quyền (nôm na: công chức và chính khách). <br>Thành phần ưu tú đã phát triển Hoa Kỳ chủ yếu thuộc về khu vực tư doanh, hoặc sinh hoạt độc lập. Họ không sợ thay đổi, còn đòi chủ động tạo ra thay đổi vì mỗi bước sẽ xây dựng thêm cái mới, và nâng cao mức thịnh vượng. Thí dụ dễ hiểu: chỉ số cổ phiếu DJIA (Dow Jones) gồm 30 doanh nghiệp giàu mạnh nhất có nhiều thay đổi trong danh mục! <br>Không thấy hãng hàng không Pan Am tiêu vong hoặc Kodak văng khỏi DJIA là chưa hiểu gì về một hiện tượng vĩnh cửu của Mỹ: dễ bị đào thải! Khi bị đào thải, họ tìm hiểu tại sao và cố gắng tái xuất giang hồ, chứ không kết tội ai đó trong xã hội là bóc lột và đòi bồi thường qua tiến trình ‘cách mạng’!<br>Trái với hiện tượng đó là các chế độ độc tài xưng danh cách mạng. <br>Thành phần ưu tú làm cho chính quyền và thuộc vào đảng để xây dựng xã hội công bằng, không có nạn bóc lột. Giới tinh hoa của họ phát huy sáng kiến để bảo vệ chế độ, nôm na là làm nghề công an hay thuộc ban tổ chức trung ương! Ở trên cùng là những kẻ phụ trách về lý luận. Vì không ai hiểu xã hội chủ nghĩa hay cộng sản chủ nghĩa là gì, ban lý luận trung ương giữ độc quyền chân lý dù thành viên chưa hề sống trong thực tế kinh tế - nôm na là kiếm ăn. Vì vậy, chế độ tồn tại rất lâu, sự lầm than lạc hậu cũng vậy, trong khi các nước dân chủ lại cứ thay đổi sau mỗi kỳ bầu cử.<br>Xin thêm vài trăm chữ dẫn nhập nữa (và nói trước là tóm lược nên bà con cần đọc lại!)<br>Khi Âu Châu đi đầu qua thời Phục Hưng rồi Minh Triết để có cuộc cách mạng kỹ thuật về phương thức sản xuất, gọi là kỹ nghệ hóa hay công nghiệp hóa, thì xã hội có nhiều thay đổi nên người ta nghiên cứu và tranh luận về xã hội, và về xã hội chủ nghĩa. Tại sao có vấn đề và làm sao chấm dứt.<br>Karl Marx xuất hiện trong giai đoạn ấy và có lý luận cực đoan mà hấp dẫn nhất. Sau đó mới viết sách chứng minh sự tiến hóa tất yếu của nhân loại. Đó là tay lý luận tuyệt vời và kẻ nghiên cứu lưu manh hoàn toàn mù lòa về sự vận hành của sản xuất. Người đưa Marx vào lịch sử chính là Lenin. Không có Lenin, tư tưởng Marx chỉ là sản phẩm lỗi thời trong viện bảo tàng.<br>Lenin đưa lý luận hàm hồ của Marx vào thực tế, để chủ động cướp chính quyền và tiến hành cách mạng. Khi cầm quyền mới giành độc quyền chân lý: định nghĩa rằng việc này đúng, việc kia sai, và sai là chết. Lý luận của Lenin thiết lập chế độ toàn trị, ách độc tài toàn diện, và hiện tượng cải tạo sau này là hệ quả tất yếu vì mỗi nơi mỗi thời suy diễn một cách, chỉ cần cho bọn chệch hướng đi mò tôm. Bôn Sơ Vích cầm quyền là Men Sơ Vích vào tù, Đệ tam Quốc tế cầm quyền là Đệ tứ bị thủ tiêu. <br>Nhưng khái niệm ‘quốc tế’ – hay cái gốc &#39;Quốc tế Cộng sản&#39; - “Comintern” là gì?<br>Giành chính quyền trong Thế Chiến I khi Đế quốc Nga đã tàn tạ, Lenin đóng góp thêm một lý luận rất hiện đại: nước Nga phải xây dựng nền tảng đế quốc với tinh thần cách mạng để có sức mạnh tiêu diệt tư bản chủ nghĩa. Tổ chức &#39;Quốc tế Cộng sản&#39; do Lenin thành lập từ 1919 đã tồn tại đến 1943 (vì nhu cầu đối đầu với Đức Quốc Xã nên phải dẹp!) Nhưng ‘nghĩa vụ quốc tế’ vẫn là bổn phận của các nước cộng sản được Liên Xô thành lập hay yểm trợ, kể cả đảng Cộng sản Trung Hoa hay Việt Nam!<br>Ngày nay, các chế độ cộng sản đều theo nhau phá sản nên mặc nhiên cho Marx vào thùng rác nhưng dùng lý luận Lenin về nội trị lẫn đối ngoại. Chỉ còn đám trí thức lạc hậu vẫn cố phát huy chủ nghĩa Mác tại các nước dân chủ là do mắc mưu lũng đoạn của Lenin (chúng được Lenin gọi là bọn ‘ngu xuẩn hữu ích’.)<br>Chế độ Lenin đó, ngày nay rõ nhất tại Trung Quốc hay Liên bang Nga, đều áp dụng lý luận kinh tế thị trường không để tiến lên tư bản chủ nghĩa mà chỉ để đảng và nhà nước thủ vai tư bản: có phương tiện bảo vệ đế quốc của mình! Nếu chúng ta không phân biệt chủ nghĩa Mác và chủ nghĩa Lenin là đã hiểu sai và sẽ thua Tập Cận Bình và Vladimir Putin. <br>Hoặc hiểu sai… cả Mao Trạch Đông lẫn Đặng Tiểu Bình - là chuyện Việt Nam.

Có đọc kỹ loại phân tách đó ta mới tính ra phí tổn và tính chất khả thi của giấc mơ hoảng tiều trong một triều đình không ai nói ngược lãnh tụ:<br>Mỗi người chỉ cần lãnh một tụ là lời to! <br>https://thespectator.com/.../donald-trump-golden-dome.../<br>Trump’s ‘Golden Dome’ will raise the risk of attack on US<br>America’s adversaries could launch preemptive strikes<br>(Benjamin Giltner &amp; Justin Logan - The Spectator - Sunday, May 25, 2025)<br>Golden Dome<br>Rockets fired from southern Lebanon are intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome (Getty)<br>President Trump and his administration are advancing plans for their version of a homeland missile defense system, dubbed the “Golden Dome.” Proponents of the Golden Dome, such as Air Force Chief of Staff General David Allvin, claim that it is required to protect the US homeland. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth praised the project, arguing it is “a generational investment in the security of America and Americans,” and that the Golden Dome would be capable of intercepting “cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles, drones, whether they’re conventional or nuclear.”<br>While this all sounds good, there are reasons to worry about the genesis of the idea, its cost, its feasibility and its risks. President Trump announced the initiative in an executive order in January titled “Iron Dome for America,” a reference to Israel’s Iron Dome system. As that executive order put it, one of the goals is to “deter – and defend its citizens and critical infrastructure against – any foreign aerial attack on the Homeland.” Even senior Department of Defense officials acknowledged that this is an “ambitious undertaking.”<br>The Trump administration should reconsider creating the Golden Dome. Not only would such a missile defense system be costly and unlikely to pull off, but it would also run new risks.<br>The first problem is that the project appears to be based on the idea that the United States can replicate the successes of Israel’s Iron Dome system. The analogy is a bad one. First, the United States’ territory is vast, whereas Israel’s is tiny. While Israel has to worry about shooting down missiles over its 8,500 square miles, the United States would need to defend all nearly 3.8 million square miles of its territory. Since each Iron Dome system defends roughly 150 square miles, the United States would need at least tens of thousands of similar systems to have a chance of defending most of America’s territory. The basic question of scale makes Trump’s claim of the $175 billion price tag for the Golden Dome highly dubious.<br>Even if somehow the Trump administration could field such a massive system so cheaply, a second problem remains: ballistic missiles are much more difficult to intercept than the short-range missiles and rockets that Israel’s Iron Dome was built to counter. The missiles Golden Dome would be aiming at, namely intercontinental ballistic missiles launched by peer adversaries, travel hundreds of times faster than those targeted by Israel’s system. To make matters worse, a large number of high-end ballistic missiles have up to 16 warheads on them. Moreover, militaries also attach decoy warheads atop these ballistic missiles to evade missile defenses. Even Israel’s recent experience defending itself with Iron Dome from a fusillade of missiles and drones launched by Iran came to disappoint. Despite the fact that Iran’s missiles are much easier to intercept than those that would be launched at the United States by Russia or China, some of them still got through. What makes the Trump administration think that a system modeled on Iron Dome could stop a much larger launch of much more highly advanced missiles – potentially armed with nuclear warheads – from a country like Russia or China?<br>Lastly, a missile defense system on this scale increases the probability of preemptive strikes. For deterrence to be most effective, each side must be made to believe it cannot win a war. A Golden Dome could give the United States the false belief that it can strike an enemy first and protect itself from retaliatory strikes. At the same time, America’s adversaries would be conscious of America’s perception that it can strike first. They would then be tempted to take two courses of action. First, to further improve their own missiles, an inexpensive endeavor compared to the costs of missile defenses. It is easier and cheaper to make missiles harder to target than it is to effectively target them.<br>Second, a Golden Dome would make it more likely that America’s adversaries would launch preemptive strikes against the United States during a crisis. US policy holds open the prospect of launching nuclear weapons first. America’s adversaries could well view this first-strike option, coupled with the prospects of an elaborate missile defense system, as dangerous. If the United States can rest securely behind its Golden Dome, what is to stop the United States from launching a first-strike itself? By posturing their missiles for preemptive strikes, America’s rivals can work to prevent the United States from escaping the condition of mutually assured vulnerability. This creates a dangerous situation. One lapse of judgment or misinterpreted action could lead to one side launching its missiles.<br>There are viable options to bolster America’s deterrence. Protecting the country’s second-strike capabilities and engaging in arms control negotiations with adversaries are just two. But pursuing a Golden Dome likely won’t work, would be immensely costly and would run new risks. Modeling US missile defense on Israel’s Iron Dome is a mistake.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R184" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">185</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/25/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">GIÁO CHỦ CỦ BỰA SAI LẦM RA SAO?<br>Trên mạng RFE/RL, Todd Prince phỏng vấn học giả Leon Aron về chủ trương đối ngoại của Trump.

Germany, the second-largest economy in NATO after the United States, in March passed reforms that would allow it to unlock billions in defense funding.<br>“Trump woke up Europe, whether he intended or not,” Aron told RFE/RL. “The Europeans don&#39;t like it, but actually, the end result was, I think, salutary.”<br>RFE/RL spoke with Aron, a senior fellow at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, as part of a series of interviews called America&#39;s Foreign Policy Shifts.<br>Aron said that Trump alone would not have gotten Europe to scale up on defense. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, unleashing the biggest war on the continent in 80 years, was an essential element, Aron argued.<br>“The combination of Trump and Ukraine, I think, moved them to really seriously contemplate the enormous delinquency in their national defenses,” Aron said in a wide-ranging interview.<br>If a decade ago, only three European members of NATO spent 2 percent of economic output on defense, the agreed-upon minimum, today only a few don’t. However, Europe’s underinvestment in its own defense in the three decades following the end of the Cold War has left a mark, Aron said.<br>(America&#39;s Foreign Policy Shift: A 3-Part Interview Series)<br>(This is a three-part series of interviews RFE/RL is conducting with global thinkers offering different perspectives on what we have learned from the first 100 days of Trump&#39;s second term. The aim is to provide insight into how the administration of US President Donald Trump is approaching some of the most challenging issues for Europe and the wider region since the end of World War II: Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, a heightened confrontation between Russia and the West, and rising tides of disinformation.)<br>As Trump seeks to shift some military power from the European theater to the Asia-Pacific region to deter China, allies will struggle to compensate, he said.<br>“It will take the Europeans years to fill the hole left by the United States,” Aron said. “They’re definitely awakened, but how they can technically arrange this very steep increase in their defense allocations remains to be seen.”<br>Aron, who was born in Moscow, focuses on US-Russia relations and Russian domestic policy.<br>From 2014 to 2020, he served on the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversaw the operations of US government-funded news outlets, including RFE/RL. He was a Russia advisor to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney during the latter’s unsuccessful bid as the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential candidate.<br>Ukraine War<br>Amid US wars against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, Romney in 2012 said that Russia - and not international terrorism - was Washington’s “number one geopolitical foe.” Two years later, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the seizure of Crimea, starting a war with Ukraine that expanded with the full-scale invasion eight years later.<br>Since beginning his second term, Trump has been pushing aggressively for a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine. After a flurry of diplomacy failed to convince Putin to agree to the 30-day cease-fire he was demanding, Trump said on May 16 that he needed to meet the Kremlin leader to end the conflict.<br>“I don’t believe anything will happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,” Trump told reporters.<br>Three days later, the US president held a third call with Putin, and it appeared to end with Trump siding with the Russian leader’s position; namely, that a cease-fire can only come after Moscow and Kyiv reach an agreement on territorial control and peacekeepers among other issues.<br>Russia and Ukraine are so far apart on the issues that it may take months at best for them to agree to a deal. Putin is widely believed to be buying time because his forces have momentum on the battlefield, and he has yet to achieve any major war aims, despite illegally laying claim to five regions of Ukraine.<br>Trump conceded late last month that Putin might be playing him for time and threatened to further sanction Russia. Nonetheless, he spun the May 19 call as a success even as the Kremlin leader appeared to get his way.<br>“How far Putin can push Trump is probably the pivotal issue in this whole situation,” Aron said.<br>Managing Russia<br>Aron said Trump, like nearly every U.S. president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, is drawn to the idea of managing relations with Moscow.<br>“There is something almost religious about this,” he said. “Trump is no different in that respect.”<br>However, unlike his predecessors, Trump doesn’t delegate the Russia portfolio to seasoned diplomats, instead preferring a more personalized approach. Trump tapped his friend, real estate developer Steve Witkoff, who has no government experience, to carry out the talks with Russia. But that hands-on style, Aron said, may be playing into Putin’s strategy.<br>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha (left), the head of Ukraine&#39;s presidential office, Andriy Yermak (second left), and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov (third left) attend a meeting for Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Istanbul on May 16.<br>“Contrary to what Trump thinks, I believe Putin feels he can play him,” Aron said. “All he has to do is periodically massage his ego, periodically wave to him from the Kremlin, and things will go his way. Unfortunately, so far, it’s working.”<br>Putin’s war aims haven’t narrowed, Aron said. The Kremlin leader still aims to conquer Ukraine even though the costs of continuing the war are staggering. Agreeing to a cease-fire at the current line of conflict holds risks for his popularity, Aron said, even as many Russians want the war to end.<br>“He has to look at his domestic situation and decide how he’s going to explain to his people the loss of what is now approaching probably close to a million soldiers, injured or killed, for essentially getting what they had to begin with: Donetsk, Luhansk, part of Zaporizhzhya, and a couple of slivers of land.”<br>Putin would need to further tighten the screws on the Russian people in the event of such a peace agreement. So far, repression has kept a lid on Russian public anger.<br>“At this point, he feels he has control of the situation,” Aron said. “Moving toward peace contains some very serious risks for him.”<br>Trump should alter his position and backstop a European-led peacekeeping force to monitor any eventual deal, Aron said. If Putin continues to drag his feet, Trump should ramp up sanctions on Russia’s oil industry, including targeting the country’s oil shipping fleet.<br>&quot;That&#39;s a very tangible blow to Putin,” he said. “This may move him toward at least contemplating peace seriously.”<br>China Watching<br>But the long war in Ukraine has strategic implications beyond Europe, particularly for Trump’s broader goal of focusing US policy on China, he said.<br>“Precisely because I assume the Trump administration wants to avoid a war with China over Taiwan, it ought to press Putin to settle for something that is not an outright defeat for Ukraine,” Aron said.<br>He said that rewarding Russian aggression could embolden Beijing - and pointed to China’s role in sustaining the war.<br>“Without China, there wouldn’t be this war,” Aron said. “China essentially finances at least half of Russian battlefield expenses by purchasing Russian oil. Xi Jinping continues to maintain that lifeline.”<br>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi welcomes Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi, before a meeting regarding the Iranian nuclear issue at Diaoyutai State Guest House on March 14, 2025, in Beijing, China<br>Meanwhile, Trump’s protectionist trade policies could undermine the very alliances needed to confront China, Aron argued. Trump accused allies and adversaries alike of taking advantage of the United States through unfair trade practices and imposed 10 percent tariffs on most countries.<br>“If the American market is curtailed by tariffs, Europe - especially Germany - may turn back to China,” Aron said. “Germany became richer over the past three decades by sending exports to China, primarily cars, but also other luxury items. They pulled back after seeing Xi’s policies, but they may be forced to go back.”<br>It is a similar situation in the Global South, where the United States, China, and Russia have been vying for influence. Countries such as Vietnam, Congo, and Zimbabwe could also pivot toward China if they lose access to the US market, he said.<br>Trump is also seeking to curtail US involvement abroad, slashing US international aid and reportedly planning to cut the diplomatic presence in Africa. While some Trump supporters have dismissed Africa as strategically unimportant, Aron said that retreating from the continent would be a mistake.<br>It’s not just that Russia and China would rush in to fill the gap, international terrorist groups would too, he added, pointing to Nigeria and Mali, where militant Islamic groups are active.<br>“Presence itself matters hugely symbolically,” he said.<br>The Trump administration has defended the policies, saying it is trying to align US aid and investment with its foreign policy goals.<br>This is the third in a three-part series on America’s foreign policy shifts.

Một nhóm Thiên Chúa Giáo tổ chức sinh hoạt tại Seattle thì bị bọn cực tả xưng danh ‘chống phát xít’ (AntiFa) tấn công, may là họ được cảnh sát bảo vệ. Nhưng sau đó, họ bị thị trưởng Seattle lên án là cực hữu và hỏi sao dám có sinh hoạt như vậy.<br>Hèn chi, cuộc khảo sát của Gallup cho thấy dân Mỹ đánh giá rất thấp bọn chính khách tiểu bang: chỉ có 14% cho là đáng tin!<br>https://jonathanturley.org/.../christians-attacked-by.../<br>Christian Group Attacked by Radicals in Seattle… Mayor Criticizes the Christians<br>(Jonathan Turley - Free Speech, Politics - May 25, 2025) <br>On Saturday, Antifa and other radicals launched another violent attack on conservatives. Pastors were holding what they described as a permitted Christian worship event in a park when black-clad Antifa members tried to storm and tear down a barricade. To their credit, the Seattle police moved in and arrested the radicals. However, what happened next is even more concerning: Mayor Bruce Harrell seemed to blame the Christian group and demanded to know why they were given a permit at all for an event in the area.<br>Police in Seattle are shown in videotapes taking down several black-clad and masked individuals who tried to overcome the fencing and storm the stage. That is clearly an improvement over the “summer of love” approach previously in Seattle.<br>One would hope that the mayor would respond with a simple statement defending free speech (including both the church and peaceful counterprotesters) while condemning the attack.<br>Instead, Mayor Bruce Harrell released the following statement that attacked the Christian group for holding an “extreme right-wing rally” while demanding an investigation into why they were given this permit instead of being moved into a more remote spot.<br>    &quot;Seattle is proud of our reputation as a welcoming, inclusive city for LGBTQ+ communities, and we stand with our trans neighbors when they face bigotry and injustice. Today’s far-right rally was held here for this very reason – to provoke a reaction by promoting beliefs that are inherently opposed to our city’s values, in the heart of Seattle’s most prominent LGBTQ+ neighborhood.<br>    &quot; When the humanity of trans people and those who have been historically marginalized is questioned, we triumph by demonstrating our values through our words and peaceful protest – we lose our voice when this is disrupted by violence, chaos, and confusion.<br>Harrell did accuse “anarchists” who “infiltrated” the event, but suggested that the permitted event was inflammatory and should not have happened:<br>    &quot;While there are broad First Amendment requirements around permitting events under free speech protections, I am directing the Parks Department to review all of the circumstances of this application to understand whether there were legal location alternatives or other adjustments that could have been pursued. The Police Department will complete an after-action report of this event, including understanding preparation, crowd management tactics, and review of arrests and citations.<br>We have discussed other Democratic politicians like Nancy Pelosi demanding reviews or revocation of permits going to Christian or conservative groups. The problem is that conservative or religious views are treated as triggering - a common claim in higher education.<br>I do not know anything about this Christian group, but they were clearly the victims, not the cause, of this violence. The suggestion that the location was too triggering for transgender activists is yet another example of a failure of leadership on the left.<br>These two groups clearly disagree on transgender policies. Fine. Protest and counterprotest. However, the police showed how to maintain a principled line. They did not take sides. They protected the free speech rights on both sides and confined their role to maintaining the peace.<br>Democratic politicians and pundits continue to legitimate Antifa and even align themselves with the vehemently anti-free speech group. This includes selling Antifa gifts on popular sites.<br>As discussed in my new book, “The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage,” I explore the history of Antifa as a movement that began in Germany. Despite the denial of its existence by figures like Rep. Jerry Nadler (D., N.Y.), I have long written and spoken about the threat of Antifa to free speech on our campuses and in our communities. This includes testimony before Congress on Antifa’s central role in the anti-free speech movement nationally.<br>As I have previously written, it has long been the “Keyser Söze” of the anti-free speech movement, a loosely aligned group that employs measures to avoid easy detection or association.  Yet, FBI Director Chris Wray repeatedly pushed back on the denials of Antifa’s work or violence. In one hearing, Wray stated, “And we have quite a number” - and “Antifa is a real thing. It’s not a fiction.”<br>We have continued to follow the attacks and arrests of Antifa followers across the country, including attacks on journalists.<br>Some Democrats have played a dangerous game in supporting or excusing the work of Antifa. Former Democratic National Committee deputy chair Keith Ellison, now the Minnesota attorney general, once said Antifa would “strike fear in the heart” of Trump. This was after Antifa had been involved in numerous acts of violence, and its website was banned in Germany.<br>Ellison’s son, Minneapolis City Council member Jeremiah Ellison, declared his allegiance to Antifa in the heat of the protests this summer. During a prior hearing, Democratic senators refused to denounce Antifa. Likewise, Joe Biden has dismissed objections to Antifa as just “an idea.”<br>Democratic leaders are playing a dangerous game in pandering to these extreme elements of their party. In the end, they will fare no better than their enemies as this mob turns on enabling establishment figures.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R186" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">187</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/25/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ĐÂY LÀ BẢN TIN DO GALLUP THÔNG BÁO  <br>Với chiều hướng sa sút của một số ngành nghề..<br>https://news.gallup.com/.../americans-ratings-professions...<br>Social &amp; Policy Issues <br>Americans&#39; Ratings of U.S. Professions Stay Historically Low<br>Nurses still easily top list of 23 occupations; clergy and judges have fallen the most, long-term<br>(by Lydia Saad - GALLUP - January 13, 2025)<br>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Three in four Americans consider nurses highly honest and ethical, making them the most trusted of 23 professions rated in Gallup’s annual measurement. Grade-school teachers rank second, with 61% viewing them highly, while military officers, pharmacists and medical doctors also earn high trust from majorities of Americans.<br>The least trusted professions, with more than half of U.S. adults saying their ethics are low or very low, are lobbyists, members of Congress and TV reporters.<br>Of the remaining occupations measured in the Dec. 2-18, 2024, poll, six (including police officers, clergy and judges) are viewed more positively than negatively by Americans, although with positive ratings not reaching the majority level. The other nine, notably including bankers, lawyers and business executives, are seen more negatively than positively, with no more than 50% rating their ethics low.<br>Today’s rank-order aligns with the public’s evaluations of U.S. occupations for the past two decades. Over this period, medical practitioners, grade-school teachers and military officers have been the most trusted professions, while political, sales, business and media-related jobs have constituted the least.<br>Nurses have earned the highest rating in every year but one since Gallup added them to the annual survey in 1999. The exception was 2001, when firefighters - included only that year - earned a record 90% trust rating after their heroism in responding to the 9/11 attacks on the Twin Towers.<br>Ethics Ratings Stalled at Low Point<br>Gallup began measuring public trust in various professions in 1976, initially covering 14 jobs. Over the years, the list has changed, with some occupations added and others removed. Since 1999, 11 professions have been tracked annually, while others have been included periodically.<br>The average very high/high ethics rating of the core 11 professions has decreased from routinely 40% or higher in the early 2000s to closer to 35% during most of the 2010s. It rose slightly in 2020, to a seven-year high of 38%, reflecting enhanced public trust in healthcare workers and teachers during the pandemic. Thereafter, the average declined each year through 2023, when it reached 30%, and it held there in 2024. This mirrors the long-term decline in Americans’ confidence in U.S. institutions.<br>The relatively low average honesty and ethics ratings in 2023 and 2024 reflect diminished scores for a few professions, in particular, since 2021. That’s the latest year that most of the professions on this year’s list - all but funeral home directors - were rated at the same time.<br>    Trust in medical doctors has fallen 14 percentage points since 2021. After reaching a historical high of 77% in 2020, doctors’ ethics rating not only returned to its 2019/pre-pandemic level of 65% but, at 53%, is now the lowest since the mid-1990s.<br>    Day care providers, pharmacists, nurses and nursing home operators - all of which had enjoyed enhanced reviews during year one or year two of the pandemic - have since dropped below their average pre-pandemic ratings.<br>    Judges have seen a 10-point decline to 28% in their honesty and ethics rating, by far the lowest for this profession which, before 2021, had scored between 43% and 53%.<br>    Views of the police have been variable, but after earning majority trust in 2020 and 2021, their rating slipped to 45% in 2023 and 44% today.<br>    Clergy have lost another six points in public esteem since 2021, continuing the long-term downward trend in trust in that profession.<br>Ratings of the other 15 professions measured in both years haven’t changed appreciably.<br>Clergy and Judges Have Fallen Most, Long-Term<br>The long-term trends paint a slightly different picture, reflecting broader political and societal changes this century.<br>From the time Gallup started rating all 23 professions in the early 2000s through this year, there has been a 26-point decline in the perceived honesty and ethics of clergy, the most for any group. The proportion saying the clergy have high or very high ethics is down from an average 56% in 2000-2009 to 30% today.<br>The decline in Americans’ religiosity over this period contributes to the loss of trust in clergy, as the growing proportion of nonreligious adults express lower trust than religious adults. However, the Catholic Church’s child sexual abuse scandals also appear to have contributed to downticks in trust in clergy, including in 2002 and 2018.<br>The second-most-significant decline in ethics ratings this century has been for judges, who have experienced a 21-point drop since the early 2000s. Some of this change occurred early on, falling from an average 49% in 2000-2009 to 46% in 2007 and to 43% in 2020. But since then, high ratings for judges have tumbled to 28%, paralleling recent downturns in Americans’ confidence in the Supreme Court as well as the judicial system and courts more broadly. The high court’s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade as well as various legal cases against Donald Trump since 2020 could explain declines in these ratings by both major parties.<br>Although trust in the police has varied over the years, the percentage of Americans expressing high trust in them is currently 15 points lower than it was in the 2000s. Grade-school teachers, medical doctors, pharmacists and bankers have also seen double-digit declines over the same period.<br>Trust in several other professions is down modestly, including TV reporters, whose nine-point slide since the 2000s reflects the decline in Americans’ broader confidence in the news media. Americans’ trust in newspaper reporters, advertising practitioners, nursing home operators and lobbyists has been consistently low over the years, with little change.<br>Auto mechanics are the lone profession experiencing improved ratings since the 2000s, rising from 24% during that decade to 33% in 2024. Most of this shift occurred between 2001 and 2017, but it has held in two readings since then. While the reason for the change isn’t clear, it’s notable that all major subgroups of Americans have warmed to this profession.<br>Bottom Line<br>From doctors and car mechanics to clergy and teachers, Americans interact with numerous professionals in their daily lives, while depending on others they’ve never met to maintain an efficient, fair and secure society. Whether reflecting personal experience or secondhand reports, Americans’ sense of how much they can trust each profession varies widely, likely influencing how they engage with each.<br>Despite declining public trust in most professions over the past quarter century, the rank order has stayed largely the same, with nurses at the top, followed by grade-school teachers, military officers, pharmacists and medical doctors. Meanwhile, in terms of net trust, members of Congress, advertising practitioners, car salespeople and lobbyists have ranked at the bottom.<br>There has been more shifting of the rank order in the middle of the list, particularly with clergy, judges and TV reporters moving down several places. Others have shifted up by default, but of the 23 professions measured this year, auto mechanics alone have moved up on account of an improved honesty and ethics score.<br>To stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on X @Gallup.<br>Learn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R187" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">188</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/25/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">PHÂN BIẾT GIỚI TÍNH NAM NỮ LÀ BỊ KẾT TỘI KỲ THỊ<br>Hôm nay giáo sư Jonathan Turley trình bày một vấn đề đã thành tiêu biểu cho hiện tượng Hoa Kỳ Cục của nước Mỹ.

Here are the covers that were included in the complaint:<br>As noted by College Fix, Amazon.com describes the book “She is She” as a work that “explores what it means to be female…and love it!<br>The appearance of the covers on his desk triggered a co-worker:<br>    “an employee at one of Mr. Theis’ schools saw the covers of the Books and complained that they were “transphobic.” IMESD labeled the display as “a hostile expression of animus toward another person relating to their actual or perceived gender identity” and ordered Mr. Theis to remove them. IMESD then warned him that “further conduct of this nature” may result in discipline, including termination of his employment. But Mr. Theis’ display of the Books caused no disruption. Indeed, not one student or school staff member had even commented about the Books to Mr. Theis since he began displaying them. The school principal even told Mr. Theis that he did not consider the Books to be offensive or inappropriate.”<br>The district defines “Bias incident” as a “person’s hostile expression of animus toward” another “person’s perceived … gender identity[.]”<br>However, the standard and underlying process of what constitutes such a violation is vague. There is no required showing of an impact on a group or any identifiable individual.<br>The district rules allow employees “to decorate their offices with personal items including paintings, photos, quotes, books, and even posters or statements that convey political messages.”<br>The complaint notes that other employees have decorated their spaces with political material as well as material supporting alternative views of gender. These include pride symbols and material. However, Theis was denied the same privilege.<br>This was the space and the covers that were found triggering and unacceptable:<br>The lawsuit claims that the district is maintaining a discriminatory Speech Policy that allows expression of support for alternative views of gender while forbidding express support for a biological view. The resulting censorship is being challenged under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Theis is seeking a preliminary injunction.<br>We have not heard from the district, so this is obviously only one side of the dispute. However, if true, this seems like a strong claim that could create a new and important precedent in favor of free speech.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R188" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">189</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/25/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">KẺ GIAN ĐỔI GIỌNG – THẰNG HỀ MẮC MƯU<br>Đọc kỹ phân tách của Jason Brodsky ta sẽ thấy Giáo chủ Iran cho Giáo chủ Củ bựa say thuốc tự mê nên biến thành hề - và tự vỗ tay.<br>https://thespectator.com/.../why-iran-wants-a-deal-with.../<br>Why Iran wants a deal with Trump<br>Iranian officials have been trying to create the impression that they are born-again Trump supporters<br>(By Jason M. Brodsky - The Spectator - Saturday, May 24, 2025)<br>Iran<br>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (Getty)<br>For Iran, the re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024 was its worst nightmare. Waking up the morning after the US election, Tehran feared President Trump’s unpredictability – and remembered the hard line he’d taken on Iran in the past and his killing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds force commander Qassem Soleimani in 2020. With Iran already reeling from losing a chunk of its proxy network in 2024, and with its air defences and missiles degraded by Israel, it was in a uniquely vulnerable position.<br>All of this forced a recalibration. Iran’s tactic changed from rebuffing to killing President Trump with kindness. Tehran decided to weaponize diplomacy to mollify an American president it both feared and loathed – without sacrificing its grand strategy of pushing the United States out of the Middle East and eradicating the State of Israel. Five months later, the result of this recalibration is nuclear negotiations with the man who ordered the elimination of Soleimani.<br>Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has been laying the groundwork for a deal himself. In April, he invoked Shiite history to justify an agreement. He cited Imam Hassan’s peace treaty with Muawiyah in 661 CE – when the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad gave up the Caliphate in return for the safety of his followers. This treaty has often been used by Iran’s leaders as an example of a tactical compromise with an enemy.<br>This was a change, as during the first Trump administration, Khamenei leaned in on the example of Imam Hossein, whose martyrdom and resistance against enemies the supreme leader said warranted an uncompromising stance to American pressure. It was this which undergirded his rejection of President Trump’s offers at engagement during his first term.<br>Throughout the last nuclear negotiations with the Biden administration that collapsed, Khamenei downplayed the talks. He focused on building a resistance economy and deepening relations with China and Russia. Now, although Khamenei recently likened the current impasse over enrichment with the second Trump administration to the unsuccessful talks held from 2021-2022 under President Biden, he has been more vocal in setting the stage for a potential deal than he was previously.<br>The shift in Tehran has filtered down from Khamenei. Rasoul Sanaeirad, an IRGC commander, said “the IRGC supports the team negotiating with America”.<br>The deputy coordinator for the IRGC’s Quds force has also said, “It was Trump who wrote a letter requesting negotiations with the Islamic Republic. The Islamic Republic responded positively to this request.” These interventions are notable, given Trump authorized the killing of the IRGC’s mainstay Soleimani.<br>The Islamic Republic’s media ecosystem has also been endorsing the talks. Javan, a daily newspaper linked to the IRGC, has been spinning the negotiations as a win for Iran, which it has portrayed as dominating the process. The paper has even backed US investment in Iran if its economic interests are met.<br>This more positive outlook in Iran towards negotiations has extended to Friday prayer sermons. In 2019, the firebrand hardline cleric Ahmad Khatami said President Trump should die frustrated in his ambitions to negotiate. Yet in an April sermon, he said, ‘accepting indirect negotiations with the US aligns with a Quranic verse stating that if the other side proposes talks, one should not refuse.’<br>This growing elite consensus in favour of the negotiations can also be seen in the public positioning of Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces. Bagheri, who has traditionally been a hardened military figure, skeptical of negotiations with the West, now supports indirect negotiations.<br>Saeed Jalili, a staunch hardline representative of Khamenei on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), has been unusually muted in his criticism of nuclear negotiations. In 2022, reports circulated that he wrote a letter to the supreme leader calling for Iran’s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the enrichment of uranium to 90 percent, which is weapons-grade.<br>The composition of the SNSC itself has changed. Masoud Pezeshkian is now president of Iran, after Ebrahim Raisi, known as the “hanging judge”, died in a plane crash. Pezeshkian, who is more invested in a nuclear agreement than his predecessor, is chairman of the SNSC. There has also been a change of foreign ministers, with Abbas Araghchi more adept at the art of negotiation. While Khamenei remains in charge of all strategic decisions, his willingness to allow a softer face like Pezeshkian to win the presidency demonstrates the importance of this diplomatic charm offensive.<br>But behind Iran’s rhetoric lies a darker reality. There has been no real effort to moderate the Islamic Republic. Instead, Tehran is using the negotiations as a shield to avoid economic sanctions and military strikes at a historic weak point. Already the Iranian currency has strengthened as the negotiations continue. The longer the process lasts, the better for Iran’s leaders.<br>The Islamic Republic’s red lines for a deal have not altered either since 2015. It wants a time-limited agreement which allows Iran to have a domestic uranium enrichment program; it wants to retain its nuclear facilities; and it wants no substantive constraints on its military industrial base, including its missile and drone programmes. And it doesn’t want to give up its network of terror proxies and partners.<br>All of this in return for sanctions relief would allow Iran to rebuild its regional and military power. It would also mean it retains its nuclear infrastructure so it has the option of producing a nuclear weapon in the future. This is, in essence, an Iranian attempt to lure the United States into agreeing to a repackaged JCPOA with minor modifications.<br>Iran is engaging in all sorts of ploys to achieve that end. It is even hawking outlandish investment opportunities to American companies. Tehran’s sympathisers have also been playing on the public desire of some American officials and personalities to visit Iran by counselling the regime to offer them high-level meetings or the prospect of President Trump winning the Nobel Peace Prize by dangling in front of the US a deal which fundamentally offers the same concessions it gave to President Obama.<br>All the while, some Iranian officials have been trying to create the bizarre impression that they are born-again Trump supporters by co-opting some of the Maga movement’s language and thinking. The Islamic Republic has even been temporarily downplaying its anti-Americanism. In 2024, unnamed Iranian officials told the New York Times that the “America First” agenda appealed to them as it would give Tehran breathing room and space for its grand strategy.<br>Already Iran’s foreign minister is trying to curry favour with President Trump by dubbing the Democrats, with whom he previously worked and banked on, as the “Failed Biden Team”. He hopes that this will lead Republicans to support a JCPOA 2.0 – which would further the Islamic Republic’s interests. Officials in Tehran hope a JCPOA 2.0 would be more durable if it is agreed by a Republican president. But Republican lawmakers have signalled that will be unacceptable.<br>Some Iranian officials have also been floating the idea of establishing a Persian Gulf nuclear consortium in the form of a joint venture with the Saudi and Emirati governments, which would involve potential American investment. This is likely designed to appeal to President Trump’s business instincts to persuade the US government to drop its demand for zero enrichment in Iran. But the reality is this is not a new proposal. Iranian officials have been hyping a variation of this nuclear consortium idea for years.<br>The Islamic Republic may also offer more inspections or lengthier sunset clauses to get the US to retreat on a more important demand for zero enrichment. But this would preserve the logic of the JCPOA.<br>To improve the mood around the talks, Iran has been pushing its allies in the region – such as the Houthis – to agree to tactical ceasefires with the Trump administration to buy time to rearm. This allows Tehran to create the illusion it is deescalating during the nuclear negotiations – when in fact it is merely a tactical pause to survive, restock and wait out the Trump administration.<br>The negotiations have been zigzagging in terms of tenor and tone. As the Trump administration has become more vocal in insisting on zero enrichment, the Islamic Republic’s diplomats have become more downcast. They are trying to influence President Trump to embrace a version of the very Obama deal with Iran he rightfully repudiated in his first term in part because it allowed Iran to enrich uranium.<br>Press reports suggest both sides are trying to conclude a framework agreement to buy time to iron out details for a final deal. But this carries risks, including the Iranians exploiting the process to avert the invocation of the UN snapback sanctions mechanism which expires in October and erode ideal conditions for Israel and/or the US to conduct a military strike on Iran’s nuclear program. Along the way, Iran may agree to nothing concrete and try to insert vague or conditional language in the framework to placate the Trump administration and keep them at the table while dragging its feet later in the negotiations over details, disclaiming any American understandings.<br>There has been a clear shift in Iran’s establishment towards supporting negotiations. But this is a cynical and tactical move designed to bolster an unrepentant regime, which feels deeply exposed at home and abroad, hawking a revamped JCPOA as a lifeline. In the end, however, the maximum Tehran is prepared to give still is nowhere near the minimum President Trump is prepared to accept.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R189" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">190</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/24/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">THOUGHTS from the FRONTLINE của JOHN MAULDIN:<br>Hôm nay cuối tuần, John Mauldin xuất hiện sau khi hoàn tất nghị hội chiến lược đầu tư SIC nên dùng thuyết trình của hai chuyên gia trong Strategic Investment Conference.

I’m now in my annual recovery period, during which I try to absorb the informational firehose I (with thousands of others) just experienced.<br>I often find SIC’s key insights come from unexpected directions. I spend months organizing the agenda in what I think is a comprehensible way. But once we get going, it takes on a life of its own. I’ve learned not to draw quick conclusions. This post-event consolidation period is just as important as the event itself.<br>I find that reviewing the transcripts thematically really helps get some perspective. For instance, various speakers said something about inflation or geopolitics or the markets almost every day. Putting them together makes it much easier to come to my own conclusions or at least understand the nuances.<br>My next few letters will share some initial thoughts from SIC organized around the major topics. Today we’ll start with inflation, and specifically the sharply different views of David Rosenberg and Jim Bianco, then balance them with some thoughts from other speakers. David and Jim are good friends whose analysis I’ve found very useful over the years. It’s hard to see how both are right this time, but the contrast between them is enlightening.<br>First, let me remind everyone you can still join me for SIC and get all the benefits. Our online portal has videos, transcripts, and slide decks for every session. You can listen to the sessions on your walks or in your workout. It’s not live but is the next best thing. Click here to get instant access.<br>Now, let’s talk about inflation.<br>1/ DAVE ROSENBERG: STILL on TEAM TRANSITORY<br>The near-term US economic forecast hinges mostly on trade and tariff questions, along with uncertainty over how everyone will react. Generally, views fall into three categories: recession, inflation and a “stagflation” scenario in between.<br>David Rosenberg is firmly in the recession camp. In fact, he was already expecting a recession even before Trump launched the current trade war. Now he thinks the trade war’s impact on consumers will be the final straw.<br>The US is uniquely vulnerable because our economy is the most dependent on consumer spending and has the lowest personal savings:<br>[Hai đồ biểu của Rosenberg Research:]<br>Source: Rosenberg Research<br>Here’s how Dave explained it (from the transcript).<br>“It&#39;s the structure of the US economy. I mean, take a look at this chart. For anybody that&#39;s saying, ‘Oh, well, the United States is being ripped off,’ no. It&#39;s simply because the United States is run on consumer spending. There&#39;s no country in the world where consumer spending as a share of GDP is as high…<br>“Most countries have actually a national sales tax [VAT]. You would never get that passed through the United States. You can&#39;t put a sales tax on the consumer. The consumer runs the economy. Not investment, the consumer.<br>“What country has a lower savings rate? What country has as much a consumption share of GDP? And there&#39;s a 95% correlation between consumer spending and imports. So, for the people that support this view that we have to eliminate all these trade deficits the United States runs, well, then maybe we have to basically take the US economy and make it more European or Asian in nature, embrace frugality, and that way we&#39;ll have less consumption and fewer imports.”<br>As Dave sees it, we’re about to have a collision between already-weakening consumer spending and tariff-induced price increases. The former points to recession, the latter to inflation. How will this develop? Dave expects inflation first, which will be transitory for a specific reason.<br>[Ba đồ biểu của Rosenberg Research:]<br>Source: Rosenberg Research<br>Again, from the transcript:<br>“Take a look at the latest New York Fed report. Only the one-year inflation expectation measure is hooked up. The three year is moving sideways. The five years hooked down, and everybody&#39;s selling their bonds. Inflation. Inflation. Tariffs are inflation. It&#39;s a price shock. It&#39;s a price shock. And I know people will laugh at transitory, but there&#39;s a reason why it wasn&#39;t transitory back in 2021 and 2022. There&#39;s a reason.<br>“And the reason why it will be transitory, I&#39;m not ashamed to use that word again, even though Jay Powell won&#39;t, is because of the labor market. The reason why the inflation lasted longer than we all thought, certainly than I thought, was because it triggered at least an 18-month wage and price spiral because the labor market was tightening. And because people are getting paid to stay out of work and not work because of the gigantic mismatch in labor demand and supply, the price shock, supply price shock from COVID transmitted into wages.<br>“I got news for you. It ain&#39;t going to happen this time around. It&#39;s not about the 4.2% lagging unemployment rate. Beneath the surface you&#39;re seeing a big drop in labor demand, job openings down, hiring rates down, job hopping way down. Totally different complexion to the job market today.”<br>The difference now, as Dave sees it, is that workers are far less confident than they were in 2021-2023. This is evident in surveys showing much higher fear of job loss and lower wage expectations. These conditions won’t produce a wage-price spiral, without which it will be hard for inflation to gain a foothold. Regardless of tariff rates, Dave expects significantly lower inflation 12 months from now.<br>Unfortunately, the inflation will give way to recession, and here’s why. Read this quote carefully. [Xin đọc kỹ ba đoạn này!]<br>“… The household sector of America has never before had $50 trillion of exposure of equities on their balance sheet. Nobody this cycle has rebalanced. Diversification became a dirty 15 letter word - buy every dip.<br>“Take a look at what the equity ownership was going into the tech wreck. Barely more than $10 trillion. Going into the financial crisis, $15 trillion. Now we&#39;re at $50 trillion so there&#39;s a lot at stake here…<br>“71% of the household financial assets is in stocks. Who wants bonds? 8% in bonds. Bonds are for losers. Who shows up at the cocktail party talking about the belly of the curve? No one will talk to you. No. We&#39;ll talk about Bitcoin and the Nasdaq-100.<br>[Households Over-Exposed to the Equity Market]<br>[Đồ biểu của Rosenberg Research:]<br>Source: Rosenberg Research<br>“But what&#39;s most important is the boomers… The median boomer is now age 70. It&#39;s not 45 or 50 or 55 as it was going into the Great Financial Crisis. And over 60% of the boomers&#39; portfolio is in the equity market. It should be 30 to 40%. Time is not on their side. And I shudder to think what happens if this ever shrinks when you&#39;re taking a look at the biggest exposures to equities are in the wrong demographic. Nobody talks about what the future consequences are going to be, especially on the labor market.<br>“Because when they can see that their retirement plans with their golden goose is not going to be coming to fruition, they might be lining up at Walmart for a job only to find out that robots taking that over. So this is what a recession looks like for those that actually believe in the LEI, for those that believe in the New York Fed model. We&#39;re not out of the woods. By the way, I think that the best that I can say is that there will not be a bad recession at this point. It could have been, but I do think that we&#39;re going to be seeing at least two or three quarters of mild negative GDP.”<br>Baby Boomers, generally speaking (you may be an exception), are deeply overexposed to the kind of equity bear market that usually accompanies even mild recessions. Many will be fine anyway, but a significant number could see their retirement plans dashed. Some will re-enter the workforce, further depressing wages and raising the unemployment rate.<br>This is problematic because broad stock market indexes always fall during a recession. Rosie gave us this chart:<br>[WHAT &quot;IF&quot; WE GET A RECESSION?]<br>Source: Rosenberg Research<br>[Bảng ghi chỉ số S&amp;P 500 qua các vụ suy trầm từ 1949 đến 2020]<br>Dave made a compelling case for this scenario. But hold that thought until you consider a different view.<br>2/ JIM BIANCO: MURDER WEAPONS<br>Jim Bianco looks at the cycle differently. To him, recessions are not a natural phenomenon. What’s natural in a capitalist economy is for growth to continue until something stops it.<br>When bad companies are allowed to fail and new ideas are free to develop, the economy changes but doesn’t have to shrink. Jim quotes the MIT economist who famously said in the 1970s, “Economic expansions don’t die of old age, they are murdered.”<br>[Bảng số của Bianco Research:]<br>Source: Bianco Research<br>If recession is looming, what will the murder weapon be this time? At SIC, Jim went through a series of high-frequency indicators like retail sales and weekly jobless claims. This “hard data” doesn’t show much cause for concern. Of course it could change, and the “soft data” says change may be coming. But it’s not here yet.<br>What is here, according to Jim, is inflation, and it’s not transitory at all. It’s more like a new normal. He thinks the post-COVID inflation marked a major change.<br>“I would postulate that inflation moves in big cycles. The inflationary cycle started in 1965. It ended in 1991, although it peaked in 1981, but it ended in 1991 with the fall of the Soviet Union. We went into a long disinflationary period. That ended with COVID, and I would argue to you that most economists and most people don&#39;t recognize that we&#39;re in Year 5 of a new inflation cycle, and that they still think we&#39;re in the Red era [see chart below].<br>“When you have a recession or a financial crisis, and we had both, the economy changes. Change does not mean worse. It means different. It changed. The economy changed post-COVID.”<br>Jim shared this chart illustrating his point. The “normal” inflation range clearly shifted higher after 2020.<br>[Đồ biểu của Bianco Research:]<br>Source: Bianco Research<br>I’ve talked about this before. The COVID pandemic and all the events around it changed the economy in ways we still don’t fully understand. Jim thinks it pushed us into a new inflation cycle, which was already underway before Trump started imposing tariffs. But the tariffs won’t help. Here’s Jim again.<br>“Tariffs mean higher prices. Who&#39;s going to eat those prices? If Trump is right and if some of Wall Street are right that we have no increase in inflation coming because of tariffs, then let&#39;s pick up the chisels and start putting Trump on Mount Rushmore right now…<br>“If he could pull that off, if we find out that they&#39;re slapping all these tariffs on and billions and billions and billions of dollars are flowing into this country and prices aren&#39;t going up, then the Chinese are paying for it and maybe Walmart&#39;s eating a little bit of it, and Trump found a way to raise taxes on somebody who&#39;s not the rich or is not Americans, he should go right up on the Mount Rushmore. ‘Don&#39;t tax me, tax the man behind the tree. The man behind the tree is Chinese, and he found a way to tax them.<br>“I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. I think we&#39;re going to find that prices go up and inflation is going to go up, and in this environment when inflation goes up, that means that the Fed holds. So, the path of least resistance on bond yields is going to be higher, and I think that it&#39;s going to be problematic for markets.”<br>Baseline inflation is now close to 3%. The “neutral” inflation rate (what the Fed calls “r-star”) is around 1 percentage point higher, so 4%, just below the current federal funds range. That means the Fed’s current policy is neither loose nor tight. If inflation forces them to get restrictive, we’re looking at 5% or more at the short end and even higher at the long end, unless the yield curve stays flat.<br>Higher interest rates might well trigger a recession. Jim isn’t sure about that. But he’s very sure inflation won’t go back to 2% any time soon. He went through a series of market-based expectations charts showing inflation remaining high until 2030.<br>A 10-year inflation wave (if this one started in 2020 and lasts until 2030) is not “transitory” by any definition. But Jim doesn’t see it as disastrous. Older readers will recall 7% or even 8% mortgages were normal in the 1990s. We’ll get through it.<br>3/ UGLY COMBINATION<br>Considering both the Rosenberg and Bianco views, the key question is when, if ever, will the pessimism seen in the “soft data” become consistently clear in the hard data? That might mean recession is getting closer.<br>Keep in mind, however, these aren’t either/or conditions. People can reduce spending by a little or a lot. Businesses can freeze hiring but not announce layoffs. There’s a lot of open territory between boom and bust.<br>This all gets much more troubling when I consider Lacy Hunt, who noted at SIC (as he has for years) that growing federal debt suppresses GDP growth. The latest news from Capitol Hill isn’t hopeful about making a dent in the debt.<br>This points toward the ugly combination of near-zero growth, if not outright recession, at the same time inflation stays elevated in ways most Americans haven’t experienced as adults. As Jim Bianco said, many of us are still mentally “anchored” in the near-ZIRP years when the Fed struggled to get inflation up to 2%. A severe recession could push inflation back down to those levels, but we wouldn’t like that, either.<br>4/ OTHER INSIGHTS ON INFLATION<br>Of course, other SIC speakers talked about inflation, too. Let’s start with Barry Habib. Barry has won four out of the last seven Crystal Ball awards from Zillow for the most accurate mortgage interest rate predictions out of 150 economists and has always been in the top five. We should pay attention to what he has to say. Quoting:<br>     “It&#39;s also interesting to understand Jerome Powell&#39;s take [on inflation]. So, Jerome Powell recently said that ‘…without price stability, we cannot achieve the long-term periods of strong labor market conditions that benefit all Americans.’ What&#39;s the translation? That the Fed has two mandates. Both mandates are very important and while if one gets extremely out of control just like an unruly child… You&#39;re going to reprimand that child, that&#39;s what the Fed will probably look at. But all things created equal…it appears that the Fed is currently thinking that inflation is more important than labor, at least for now. So, driving more Fed decisions will be inflation data as opposed to labor data, although both are critically important unless the labor data gets really out of control.<br>     “The odds are that there&#39;s a chance that we should see inflation decline. I know that there&#39;s a lot of tariff stuff in between, but we should see inflation decline, although slowly, and that should mean that rates should decline [over time], and that should give us some clues on the housing market. Now that said, I think the core PCE inflation is going to be stubborn and it&#39;s going to be stubborn because the replacement values that we saw in the middle and second half of 2024 were pretty modest. So as new data comes out, it&#39;s going to replace the 2024 data and it will be hard to make year-over year progress in a very meaningful way. Probably hover around the 2.5-ish range. It&#39;s kind of where we see things on core PCE inflation, which will still be above the Fed&#39;s target.<br>     “But one of the things they look at is that three-month and six-month run rate. And currently, the bad news is that the three-month and six-month run rates that the Fed looks at so carefully are running above the annual rates. So that&#39;s [the bad comparisons] got to get through the snake and that will make progress on year-over-year inflation stubborn, although the markets will respond favorably if we get good low month-over-month readings or monthly readings.”<br>That being said, Barry believes the Fed will cut rates two or three times this year even in the face of stubborn inflation. Barry has been very critical of Powell (as I have been) for several years for letting inflation get out of control. Powell is concerned about his legacy and seems afraid to let inflation come back. Barry thinks he is overestimating the strength of the labor market (he sees the labor market data similarly to David Rosenberg and Danielle DiMartino) and will soon have to react:<br>     “Now, I think the Fed&#39;s going to get religion and get sober later…Maybe it&#39;s 2 cuts, maybe one&#39;s 50, one&#39;s 25, or maybe it&#39;s three 25 bp cuts, but second half of the year, as that unemployment rate rises, we get past some of the tariff uncertainty. There&#39;s going to be no cover for Jerome Powell. They&#39;re going to have to address the fact that the economy is not as strong as he thinks.”<br>That is why Barry thinks mortgage rates will also come down, closer to the 6% range. He spent a great deal of time going through his rationale on that.<br>Let me quickly summarize Peter Boockvar’s inflation view. Peter listens to over 100 earnings calls every quarter. Nearly every company is talking about raising prices. They are trying to find out how much of the tariffs they can pass through. Even if they eat some of the tax, prices are still going up to the end consumer. To the extent companies absorb the tariffs, it means lower earnings, capital investment or employment. Peter thinks this will start to show in the third quarter. And then we’ll see. And he points out that a falling dollar is inherently inflationary. The USD is down almost 10% since the beginning of the year.<br>I wish I had more space, but it’s time to wrap up. Next week we’ll stay with SIC, shifting our attention to another important topic.<br>5/ DALLAS, EAST PALM BEACH, and DC<br>It now looks like I will be in Dallas the first week of June as we open our longevity clinic there. The next week I expect to fly to East Palm Beach and the DC area for a few days, visiting our new clinics as they open.<br>With the SIC over, my publishers will be glad to know I’m giving more attention to finishing my book on cycles and what I feel will be a coming crisis. Felix Zulauf agrees with me and, like me, thinks it will be manageable if you properly prepare.<br>Shane is such an optimist. We have this small “dead spot” just to the right of our front door overshadowed by palm trees, bushes and our garage. She has been trying to grow grass there for six years. There are workers yet once again outside my window as I finish this letter. I asked her why she thinks this time will be different. We have a really top-notch contractor and he believes he has a new type of grass that will work here. I am skeptical, but I am not going to deny that look of childlike hope in my wife’s face. And I’m old and wise enough to not even whisper, “The definition of insanity is to try something over and over expecting a difference.” Happy wife, happy life.<br>And with that I will hit the send button and wish you a great week.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R190" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">191</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/24/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TRONG KHI SÂN SAU (THẾ HỆ SAU) CỦA MỸ ĐÃ BỊ TẨY NÃO!...<br>Chúng ta vừa liếc qua bài tường thuật của WSJ về mâu thuẫn giữa Chính quyền Trump và Liên Âu thì nên nhìn vào sân sau của nước Mỹ: Trẻ em Hoa Kỳ bị tẩy não từ lâu để có phản ứng kỳ thị Do Thái và ngợi ca Hồi giáo Palestine, thí dụ như giải trí với truyện thần thoại có nội dung đề cao khủng bố Hamas! <br>Xin đọc bài Seth Mandel phân tách trên số mới nhất của nguyệt san Commentary:<br>https://www.commentary.org/.../how-textbooks-and.../<br>How Textbooks and Children’s Shows in America Became Hamasified<br>(by Seth Mandel - Commentary - May 24, 2025 - American Society)<br>We are coming up on the 18th anniversary of the death of Farfour the mouse. And he is strangely more relevant to us now than he ever was in life.<br>Farfour was a demented Palestinian ripoff of Mickey Mouse, the main character (until his martyrdom) on the children’s show Tomorrow’s Pioneers, which aired on Hamas’s Gaza-based television station Al-Aqsa. When people say Palestinian children in Gaza have been reared on anti-Semitic brainwashing, they mean Farfour and his ilk.<br>The militant mouse met his maker in June 2007 when his dying grandfather (who was not a giant mouse, but a regular old Arab man) entrusted him with the key to Tel Aviv and claimed it was actually Palestinian land. Farfour felt the weight of his new responsibility “to liberate this land from the filth of the criminal, plundering Jews.” As you can probably guess, he was martyred at the hands of those “criminal, plundering Jews,” and the announcement was made by a young Palestinian girl.<br>This was, at the time, both semi-comical and horrifying. But the kind of anti-Jewish brainwashing that was done on children’s television and in elementary-school textbooks was the subject of bipartisan condemnation. Indeed, just a few months before Farfour’s untimely martyrdom, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton denounced such indoctrination of Palestinian children as nothing less than “a clear example of child abuse.”<br>At the time, it was still unthinkable that America would have this exact problem. Now it is undeniable that we do.<br>There was a revealing moment at a congressional hearing on anti-Semitism in elementary-school curricula about a year ago. Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Republican from California, asked Enikia Ford Morthel, the superintendent of the Berkeley Unified School District, about a Berkeley lesson that states: “for some Palestinians, ‘From the River to the Sea’ is a call for freedom and peace.”<br>Morthel defended the lesson, to which Kiley very reasonably responded: “You put this on a slide in the classroom and then students go around in the halls saying it. I don’t think there’s anything surprising about that.”<br>Quite so. Children in America are being taught to repeat genocidal slogans about Jews.<br>A couple of months ago, I wrote about another such moment - this one at a state hearing involving the infamous Massachusetts Teachers Association and various anti-Semitic lesson plans. One was a grade-school workbook for kids in kindergarten and first grade called Handala’s Return, which featured on its front page a map of Israel and Gaza and the West Bank all labeled “Palestine.” Israel did not exist in this lesson plan. Handala explains that “Zionists” took her family’s home by force and won’t let her back even though she has the key. The students are then asked to draw their own home and key, presumably to imagine their own sadness were the Jews to come and take their home away.<br>At the end of the workbook - again, designed for children about five or six years old - is a page titled “Help Handala Free Palestine.” The students are instructed to write on the page what they will do, specifically, to “raise funds for the children of Palestine” and what they will chant at a “Palestine protest.”<br>There have been endless examples, documented here and elsewhere, of anti-Semitism in American grade-school lesson plans, but I chose these two because they specifically shine a light on the fact that young children here are being drafted as child soldiers into “the Palestinian struggle.” They are not simply taught bad things about Jews; they are taught to act on them from a very young age.<br>Will American children get their own Farfour, too? Inevitably. America’s Farfour-ward slide is well under way.<br>Earlier this week, what has become one of the more infamous modern blood libels was circulated around the world when a UN humanitarian director told the BBC that 14,000 Gazan babies would die in the next 48 hours due to Israel’s withholding of aid. Eventually, the BBC and others issued corrections when it turned out that the study had been misread and the actual number of babies about to die from Israel’s blockade, as detailed in the report, was zero.<br>But of course it had been widely repeated before being retracted, and not just by media and politicians. Ms. Rachel, a massively popular children’s YouTube host often compared to Mister Rogers, made a video about the Big Lie that would have made Leni Riefenstahl proud. Holding her own newborn daughter, Ms. Rachel tearfully appealed to the viewers while a picture of a sickly Palestinian baby was put on screen at the same time.<br>The baby on screen appears to be a six-month-old girl named Siwar Ashour, the Independent points out. Siwar has an esophageal medical condition that makes it difficult for her to drink her mother’s breastmilk. Nonetheless, Ms. Rachel uses Siwar as an example of Israel’s evil child-murder scheme. Ms. Rachel, crying, implores viewers to “just look at her, and… think about a baby you love.”<br>She then says that “you can’t be about to let 14,000 kids starve, and we all know not to bomb and kill and starve children… please don’t kill so many children.”<br>Ms. Rachel has more than 13 million subscribers, and her show has gotten 9 billion views in the six years of its existence. This particular video, however, has been deleted from her Instagram page, now that we all know everything in it is a lie. But the damage is done. Farfour would be proud.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R191" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">192</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/24/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TẠI SAO TRUMP VỪA NỔI ĐIÊN VỚI LIÊN ÂU?<br>Nhật báo WSJ có bài giải thích (cho người Mỹ ngu) về việc Trump gay gắt đả kích rồi gây áp lực về quan thuế với khối Liên Âu do diễn biến đàm phán quá chậm về ngoại thương. <br>Về bối cảnh, Liên Âu là một câu lạc bộ kinh tế chính trị gồm có 27 quốc gia.

Photo: Cole Burston/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images<br>Key Points - What&#39;s This?<br>* Trump threatens 50% tariffs on EU imports starting June 1, citing frustrations over trade talks.<br>* U.S. officials are irritated by what they say is the EU’s slow pace and reluctance to address U.S. concerns such as antitrust fines.<br>*  The U.S. wants the EU to impose tariffs on Chinese industries.<br>---<br>President Trump’s surprise tariff threat against the European Union came in the midst of deepening frustration on his economic team over the 27-nation bloc’s approach to taxes, regulations and China.<br>Trump’s advisers have privately expressed irritation to European officials that EU member nations’ differing trade priorities have slowed down the talks, according to people familiar with the discussions. The advisers have complained about what they see as Europe’s cautious approach to the negotiations and what they refer to as the EU’s reluctance to make concrete offers that address U.S. concerns. They include fees on streaming services, value-added taxes, automotive regulations, and fines imposed against U.S. companies in antitrust cases, the people said.<br>The U.S. has so far not secured a commitment from EU leaders to place new tariffs on Chinese industries, a priority for Trump administration officials who are pushing to ratchet up trade pressure on Beijing, the people said. As part of separate trade negotiations with the U.S., the U.K. agreed to move toward imposing tariffs on Chinese steel, the people said. That helped seal the U.S.-U.K. trade deal that Trump announced this month. EU officials have indicated a willingness to address nonmarket economies such as China’s, according to people familiar with the bloc’s approach.<br>The U.S.-EU tensions boiled over Friday morning, when Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on European imports starting June 1.<br>In the Oval Office on Friday afternoon, Trump signaled that he plans to follow through - at least for now - on his threat, saying he is “not looking for a deal” with the EU.<br>The president has for years expressed outrage at Europe both in public and in private, often berating the continent’s leaders more pointedly than he does some American adversaries. <br>Starting in his first term, Trump criticized North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries for not spending enough money on defense, a charge he has repeated for years. This month he said that the EU is “nastier than China.” He has referred to the bloc’s antitrust fines as taxes on U.S. companies. In February, he said the EU “was formed in order to screw the United States.”<br>Container ship being loaded at the Port of Rotterdam.<br>Containers are loaded onto a vessel in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Photo: piroschka van de wouw/Reuters<br>Trump’s blunt negotiating tactics stand in contrast to the more staid and process-oriented approach of EU leaders, which includes frequent consultations with member countries.<br>Trump’s Friday morning threat, issued in a social-media post, came as a surprise to EU officials and diplomats, who had expressed optimism in recent days that trade discussions had begun to pick up after a slow start.<br>The EU and U.S. exchanged documents recently that described possible points of discussion in trade talks, a step some European diplomats viewed as a positive development, and the bloc has privately indicated that it is ready to cooperate with the U.S. to address China’s state subsidies for key industries, said a person briefed on the talks. <br>The EU trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, spoke on a call with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hours after Trump’s Truth Social post. <br>After Friday’s call, Šefčovič said the EU is fully engaged in trade talks with the U.S., but is ready to defend its interests. Trade between the two sides is unmatched, Šefčovič wrote in a social-media post, but “must be guided by mutual respect, not threats.” An EU official said Friday that China hasn’t been a major sticking point in talks between the two sides.<br>Trader viewing stock market data on monitors.<br>Stocks dropped Friday on fresh trade tensions. Photo: timothy a. clary/AFP/Getty Images<br>EU officials have sought to find a middle ground in responding to the U.S. that is less aggressive than China’s trade retaliation, but more assertive than the U.K. The U.K. reached a deal with the U.S. this month that kept in place Trump’s 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.K. goods. Several EU ministers said recently that they wouldn’t be satisfied with a trade deal that maintained the 10% tariffs.<br>The China-related discussions are part of a U.S. strategy to push trading partners to penalize the world’s second-largest economy through negotiations over Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs, which were imposed in early April before being suspended for 90 days to allow for talks. The U.S. strategy seeks to limit China’s involvement in other economies - particularly in strategic industries such as steel—as well as pushing other nations to apply tariffs to China’s goods to counter state subsidies provided by Beijing that make its products more competitive worldwide. <br>The U.S. has made similar China-related “economic security” requests with other key trading partners such as Japan and South Korea, people with knowledge of the discussions said, though no commitments have yet been made public.<br>China remains an important market for EU exports, and European leaders are reluctant to launch a high-profile trade war with Beijing.<br>The EU and the Trump administration have fundamentally different approaches to trade talks. Trump has been eager to announce deals quickly. <br>The European Commission, the bloc’s executive body, is in charge of trade policy, but communicates regularly with its 27 member states to ensure they are on board with its approach. That process means the EU often moves slowly - a central source of frustration for the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent raised concerns about the pace of trade talks to EU officials during a meeting of finance ministers in Canada this past week, according to a U.S. official.<br>The bloc has so far held the line against some of Trump’s demands. Officials have said they don’t plan to change the bloc’s value-added tax, which the Trump administration has criticized and which the EU and many economies view as nondiscriminatory. It also won’t change health and digital regulations, officials have said.<br>An EU diplomat said Friday that it was difficult to know from Trump’s post whether the president actually intends to follow through on his tariff threat. “You can’t base policy off a Truth Social post,” the diplomat said. <br>In a Fox News interview Friday, Bessent said he hoped the threat of 50% tariffs would “light a fire under the EU.”<br>The EU’s trade chief traveled to Washington in April armed with proposals to cut both sides’ industrial tariffs and for the EU to buy more American energy and soybeans, but left empty-handed. “The EU is doing its part,” a spokesman said after that meeting. “Now, it is necessary for the U.S. to define its position.”<br>The U.S. recently sent a document to the EU outlining several areas the U.S. wants concessions on, including nontariff barriers as well as economic security, a term that is often used to refer to concern about China’s economic dominance. The EU’s response, which covered several trade issues, included an indication that the bloc was prepared to cooperate on China, people briefed on the matter said.<br>The EU previously approved tariffs for 21 billion euros of U.S. imports, equivalent to around $24 billion, but put those duties on hold after the Trump administration announced its 90-day pause on some U.S. tariffs. It also proposed targeting a second set of goods, worth up to 95 billion euros, if negotiations with the U.S. break down.<br>Write to Gavin Bade at gavin.bade@wsj.com and Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R192" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">193</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/24/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ĐẠI HỌC RỪNG RÚ!<br>Giáo sư Jonathan Turley đề cập tới một hiện tượng trong đại học UCLA tại miền Nam California, nhưng không là một đại học duy nhất: sinh viên ngang nhiên phá phách hoặc xóa bỏ các hình ảnh họ không ưa thích, mà chẳng bị cảnh sát ngăn cản, hay trừng phạt.<br>Xã hội Hoa Kỳ ngày càng loạn mà loạn nhất là trong các đại học:<br>https://jonathanturley.org/.../vandal-wearing-ucla-law.../<br>Vandal Wearing “UCLA Law” Sweater Destroys Pro-Life Display on Campus<br>(Jonathan Turley - Academia, Criminal law, Free Speech, Politics -May 24, 2025)<br>We have been following a rise in political violence and property destruction on the left this year. The latest such example is from UCLA where a young man destroyed pro-life posters. This man is accused of previously stealing signs from the group and the group has posted images of the alleged perpetrator wearing a “UCLA Law” sweater.(Note: There has been no official determination or charge that this is the culprit by police).<br>Justice for All posted the pictures and alleges that this apparent student previously attacked their displays two years ago. The group issued this statement:<br>    &quot;A UCLA student vandalized our signs with spray paint. He also stole four of our signs in 2023, and has yet to be found by police. If anyone knows who this is, DM us. A police report has been filed, and we will press charges both for the theft and for the vandalism.<br>    &quot;A police report has been filed, and we will press charges both for the theft and for the vandalism. Thankfully, most pro-choice people are not like this. They are respectful and willing to dialogue and wouldn’t think to do something like this. You can hear in the background a man telling him this is wrong even though he disagreed with us. Most of our outreaches are peaceful, and we are able to have respectful conversations with those on the other side. Sometimes that’s not the case though.<br>    &quot;We care about this student which is why we want him held accountable. This behavior is unacceptable.<br>The sweater could be misleading as to his association with the law school. However, the possibility that he is a law student is chilling for a number of reasons. First, it would mean that law students and possibly faculty may be aware of his actions but have not come forward. That may include the person heard in the background telling him to stop.<br>Second, it shows the sense of impunity and license that some have in committing criminal acts for political purposes. This could be someone who actually wants to practice law, but believes that he has a right to commit such criminal acts.<br>Students do not come to this sense of license on their own. Faculty have reinforced the sense of impunity with their own actions.<br>We have seen conservative and pro-life groups attacked on campuses across the country, including by faculty members (here and here). A recent attack occurred at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, where a young man tossed a pro-life display while declaring, “I f**king hate you.”<br>It is now common to hear inflammatory language from professors advocating “detonating white people,” denouncing police, calling for Republicans to suffer,  strangling police officers, celebrating the death of conservatives, calling for the killing of Trump supporters, supporting the murder of conservative protesters and other outrageous statements. One professor who declared that there is “nothing wrong” with such acts of violence as killing conservatives was actually promoted.<br>Faculty have resigned from UCLA over the intolerance for conservatives and libertarians. UCLA law school has been challenged over its own conduct toward faculty with dissenting views. Faculty at the school have had to secure police protection due to threats.<br>That is the culture that produces this type of extreme rhetoric among students. These faculty members have normalized violent speech and conduct.<br>Of course, some professors have gone further and committed acts of political violence. Such conduct should be prosecuted and those faculty members fired. However, even in those extreme cases, liberal faculty have often rallied around their colleagues.<br>Years ago, many of us were shocked by the conduct of University of Missouri communications professor Melissa Click, who directed a mob against a student journalist covering a Black Lives Matter event. Yet, Click was hired by Gonzaga University. Since that time, we have seen a steady stream of professors joining students in shouting down, committing property damage, participating in riots, verbally attacking students, or even taking violent action in protests.<br>At the University of California Santa Barbara, professors actually rallied around feminist studies associate professor Mireille Miller-Young, who physically assaulted pro-life advocates and tore down their display.  Despite pleading guilty to criminal assault, she was not fired and received overwhelming support from the students and faculty. She was later honored as a model for women advocates.<br>At Hunter College in New York, Professor Shellyne Rodríguez was shown trashing a pro-life display of students.<br>She was captured on a videotape telling the students that “you’re not educating s–t […] This is f–king propaganda. What are you going to do, like, anti-trans next? This is bulls–t. This is violent. You’re triggering my students.”<br>Unlike the professor, the students remained calm and respectful. One even said “sorry” to the accusation that being pro-life was triggering for her students.<br>Rodríguez continued to rave, stating, “No you’re not - because you can’t even have a f–king baby. So you don’t even know what that is. Get this s–t the f–k out of here.” In an Instagram post, she is then shown trashing the table.<br>Hunter College, however, did not consider this unhinged attack to be sufficient to terminate Rodríguez.<br>It was only after she later chased reporters with a machete that the college fired Rodríguez. She was then hired by another college.<br>Another example comes from the State University of New York at Albany, where sociology professor Renee Overdyke shut down a pro-life display and then resisted arrest. One student is heard screaming, “She’s a [expletive] professor.” That, of course, is the point.<br>In Wisconsin, a department chair was recently shown destroying a table of conservative students.<br>In such an environment, it is hardly surprising to see an apparent student calmly destroying displays with no sense of fear of repercussions.<br>The question is whether UCLA, which has had the picture of the alleged culprit since the first incident two years ago, will now take action.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R193" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">194</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/24/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ĐẢNG CỘNG HÒA NÊN ĐỌC KỸ BÀI NÀY ĐỂ CÒN TỰ CỨU!<br>Kẻ cần đọc nhất thì vừa ngu vừa xấc nên coi như vô phương...<br>https://www.wsj.com/.../tariffs-mean-electoral-defeat-for...<br>Opinion - Commentary<br>Tariffs Mean Electoral Defeat for the GOP<br>The debacle of 1932 is the most famous example, but Republican (and Whig) losses span the period 1842 through 2020.<br>(By Phil Gramm and Donald J. Boudreaux - WSJ - May 21, 2025)<br>image<br>Illustration: Martin Kozlowski<br>The Trump administration is looking for an exit strategy from the most destructive parts of its trade war. The uncertainty is heightening the risk of a recession. Millions of business supply chains have been dismantled. The postwar trading system, responsible for 80 years of peace and prosperity, is in tatters. Some of the damage is irreversible. But if history is any guide, the latest protectionist experiment will soon be over.<br>While protectionists portray the 18th and 19th centuries as a happy period when Americans prospered behind tariff protections, nothing is further from the truth. Americans have historically hated high tariffs and never suffered them for long. Almost 300 years ago American colonists revolted against repeated British efforts to impose tariffs on American imports. Colonists defied the 1733 Molasses Tariff with widespread smuggling. Crying “taxation without representation,” they mounted a crusade against the 1767-68 Townshend Acts that forced Parliament to repeal them. The Tea Act of 1773 sparked the Boston Tea Party and was effectively repealed at Lexington and Concord.<br>Under the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution, the U.S. government had no power to tax income until 1913. Throughout the 19th century tariffs supplied 50% to 95% of federal revenue, but government was small and its revenue demands modest.<br>While Alexander Hamilton wanted to promote manufacturing with subsidies, which Congress opposed, he was skeptical of high tariffs. No revenue is collected on goods that aren’t legally imported, and Hamilton feared that tariffs would encourage domestic inefficiency. The rising demand for revenue to fund public works and a political effort to protect U.S. producers led to the “Tariff of Abominations” in 1828, which imposed an all-time high average tariff rate of 57.3%. In the following elections tariff supporters suffered devastating electoral defeats as Andrew Jackson and the Democrats were swept into power. From 1830-60 average tariff rates fell by 70%, and industrial production soared at an average annual rate of 6.2%. By 1860 average U.S. tariffs were among the lowest in the world.<br>In 1842 Congress adopted and Whig President John Tyler signed the so-called “Black Tariff,” the only significant effort to raise tariffs from 1830-60. But less than three months after the enactment of this tariff, the Whigs lost their majority in the House and three seats in the Senate. In the 1844 elections they lost the Senate majority and the presidency. The tariff was repealed.<br>With the coming of the Civil War, tariffs became a significant revenue source, but from 1870-90 average tariff rates fell by 30% and industrialization surged. The McKinley Tariff, enacted in October 1890, triggered a political bloodbath a month later when William McKinley and 92 other Republican representatives lost their seats and four Republican senators suffered the same fate. In 1892 Democrat Grover Cleveland was elected in a landslide. By 1895 the average tariff rate had fallen by a third.<br>In 1909 Republicans again raised tariffs with the passage of the Payne-Aldrich Tariff, and voters again revolted, taking the White House, 117 House seats and 13 Senate seats away from the Republicans in the 1910 and 1912 elections. The tariff was repealed and widespread hostility to tariffs helped fuel the passage of the 16th Amendment allowing for the levying of federal income taxes.<br>Farm exports soared during World War I, but by 1920 Europe was recovering and farm prices were falling. In 1922 Congress passed the Fordney-McCumber Tariff, which was initially meant to protect agriculture, but during its adoption a flurry of amendments broadened its coverage. The tariff failed to provide relief to farmers and in the 1922 elections Republicans lost 77 seats in the House and seven in the Senate.<br>The infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff, enacted in 1930, helped transform a financial panic into a worldwide depression. The 1932 elections were cataclysmic for the Republicans, giving Democrats control of the White House for 20 years, the Senate for 44 of the next 48 years, and the House for 58 of the next 62 years. In 1934 Congress adopted the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which delegated power to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to negotiate reciprocal trade reductions and back the world out of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff.<br>From 1934 until 2018, while minor tariffs and trade restrictions were imposed to relieve occasional political pressures, trade policy under 13 presidents reflected the belief that expanding trade benefits the U.S. The 85-year bipartisan trade consensus ended with the Trump tariffs in 2018. Those 2018 tariffs were tiny compared with the tariffs announced in the first 100 days of the second Trump administration. While numerous factors affect elections, tariffs didn’t prove a winning political issue in 2018, when Republicans lost the House, or in 2020, when they lost the Senate and White House.<br>Even if Mr. Trump negotiated his tariff increase down to 10%, that threefold increase in average U.S. tariff rates would raise consumer prices, disrupt domestic production, slow economic growth and prove toxic to Republicans in the midterm elections, which are less than 18 months away.<br>The clearest exit from this road to economic perdition is to reduce the tariffs by negotiating real reciprocal trade agreements. The U.S. should do so in return for its trading partners reducing tariffs on American goods and services. These reciprocal tariff reductions would lower prices and expand production and economic growth for the U.S. and our trading partners. We will miss that exit unless members of Congress and the administration remember that silence is consent.<br>___<br>Mr. Gramm is a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

AP/Jacquelyn Martin, file<br>A.R. HOFFMAN<br>(By A.R. HOFFMAN - NY Sun - May. 23, 2025 04:46 PM ET)<br>The hiring of Attorney General Garland by a billion-dollar law firm, Arnold &amp; Porter, could well lead to President Trump sanctioning another blue-chip legal entity. <br>America’s 86th attorney general is one of Mr. Trump’s foremost antagonists, having in 2023 appointed Special Counsel Jack Smith to conduct a criminal investigation of Mr. Trump for election interference and the storage of secret documents at Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Smith ended up bringing criminal charges against Mr. Trump in both cases, though these cases were dismissed when Mr. Trump won the 2024 presidential election.  <br>Mr. Garland also oversaw the prosecution of more than 1,500 January 6 defendants, which amounted to one of the largest law enforcement dragnets in the history of the Department of Justice. Some of the protesters received stiff prison sentences. Mr. Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of all of those defendants, calling their prosecution a “grave national injustice.”  <br>Prior to serving as America’s top law enforcement official, Mr. Garland was the chief judge of the District of Columbia Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals. He was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Obama after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but a confirmation vote was foiled by Senator McConnell. Justice Neil Gorsuch was eventually confirmed for that seat, preventing a swing to the left for the high court. <br>Arnold &amp; Porter, in a statement celebrating Mr. Garland’s return to the firm after he worked there earlier in his career, heralds his “unique depth of experience” and “distinguished career at DOJ.” Mr. Garland declares: “It is an honor to return to Arnold &amp; Porter, where I first learned how to be a lawyer and about the important role lawyers can play in ensuring the rule of law.”<br>Mr. Garland’s reference to “the rule of law” could amount to a veiled criticism of the Trump administration, which Democrats have accused of running roughshod over legal norms. Mr. Trump in September reckoned that “the disgraceful conduct of Attorney General Merrick Garland has done tremendous damage to a once great institution.” Now, Arnold &amp; Porter’s touting of his hiring could raise the 47th president’s ire.  <br>Mr. Trump’s executive order against Jenner and Block, for example, noted how the firm “was ‘thrilled’ to re-hire the unethical Andrew Weissmann after his time engaging in partisan prosecution as part of Robert Mueller’s entirely unjustified investigation.” Mr. Trump accused the firm of having “abandoned the profession’s highest ideals, condoned partisan ‘lawfare,’ and abused its pro bono practice to engage.”    <br>Mr. Garland has also attracted criticism from the left. One former federal prosecutor, Ankush Khardori, ventured that Mr. Garland “may go down as one of the worst and most broadly unpopular attorney generals in American history - hated by the anti-Trump part of the country for failing to bring Trump to justice, and hated by the pro-Trump part of the country for pursuing Trump at all.”      <br>Mr. Garland was harshly criticized by the left for taking too long to appoint a special counsel to investigate Mr. Trump, thereby allowing the president to run down the clock and eventually avoid a conviction that could have brought him a stiff prison sentence. The Department of Justice prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president.  <br>Since returning to power, Mr. Trump has been taking on so-called Big Law,  which has traditionally supported liberal causes with its pro bono work. Mr. Trump’s executive orders against law firms - those that employed prosecutors who sought to imprison him, and devoted extensive pro bono resources to fighting key policy initiatives from his first term - have emerged as legal flashpoints in the first months of his presidency. <br>The orders have stripped security clearances for lawyers at the targeted firms, terminated government contracts, and even prevented employees from entering government buildings. Government work is a lucrative revenue stream for many Big Law firms. <br>Mr. Trump is also targeting the firms for their internal policies of “diversity, equity and inclusion,” including what the firms call “diversity pipelines,” which the White House reckons are illegal racial quota programs.<br>Several firms, like Paul, Weiss and Skadden Arps, have chosen to reach agreements with the White House whereby the punitive orders are withdrawn in exchange for supporting the president’s agenda. These terms have included banishing DEI programs and setting aside millions of dollars for different kinds of pro bono work, such as countering antisemitism.  <br>Other firms, like Perkins Coie, have elected to litigate the orders as unconstitutional. Perkins secured an injunction blocking the order against it from Judge Beryl Howell, an appointee of President Obama, who wrote, “If the founding history of this country is any guide, those who stood up in court to vindicate constitutional rights and, by so doing, served to promote the rule of law, will be the models lauded when this period of American history is written.”<br>Judge Howell determined that Mr. Trump’s order “presents an unprecedented attack” on the rule of law and “violates the Constitution in multiple ways.” Perkins Coie occupies a special place in the anti-Trump canon for the key role it played in the development of the Russia probe during Mr. Trump’s first term.<br>The order notes that “in 2016 while representing failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Perkins Coie hired Fusion GPS, which then manufactured a false ‘dossier’ designed to steal an election.” That arrangement was coordinated by a former partner of the firm, Marc Elias. Mr. Trump is likely to appeal Judge Howell’s ruling. <br>In addition to hiring Mr. Garland, Arnold &amp; Porter has a long record of liberal pro bono work. In particular, the firm has plowed resources into fighting Mr. Trump’s border polices and working on behalf of “voter rights” initiatives. The firm has also represented Black Lives Matter-supporting demonstrators who sued police departments after the George Floyd-related unrest.<br>Arnold &amp; Porter and Mr. Garland did not respond to requests for comment by press time.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R195" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">196</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/23/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">CHIẾN LƯỢC ĐÀM PHÁN CỦA VLADIMIR PUTIN:<br>Trên mạng Geopolitical Futures do ông sáng lập sau khi rời Stratfor, George Friedman phân tách chiến lược đàm phán của Putin sau khi tấn công Ukraine mà không xong.

Trump is constantly optimistic, Putin is constantly saying he wants peace (despite the fact that the situation makes a rapid settlement impossible), and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is helplessly caught in between.<br>I do not normally personalize geopolitics, but these talks are not about geopolitics, the reality of which is clear: Russia has failed to defeat Ukraine. The phase of the peace process we are in, such as it is, is what I call engineering. It is the process by which leaders of countries try to construct an edifice that is necessarily based in reality but is compatible with each side’s political needs – in terms of international relations and internal politics alike. The process of engineering is essential and extraordinarily difficult. The most difficult parts of this particular feat of engineering are Putin’s political needs.<br>I compare this phase of engineering to the negotiations that ended the Vietnam War. The U.S. went to war to block North Vietnam, a communist state, from conquering South Vietnam and extending Chinese and Russian power in Southeast Asia. The assumption was that U.S. military power would readily defeat the Viet Cong, and that doing so was a geopolitical necessity. The U.S. failed because it underestimated the power of the Viet Cong, supported as it was by the Soviet Union, and because it couldn’t craft an appropriate military strategy to defeat the enemy before it. The Viet Cong was fighting for fundamental national imperatives – including reunifying Vietnam under Hanoi’s control – while the U.S. was fighting for a marginal geopolitical imperative. In short, the U.S. lost the war by not winning it, and its defeat had domestic political consequences all around the world, particularly in the U.S. The negotiations to end the war took place from 1969 to 1973. Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon were negotiating an end to the conflict, of course, but they also had the political imperative to show the world U.S. power had not been diminished.<br>The Russians invaded Ukraine in 2022 to regain the buffer they had lost with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Moscow greatly overestimated its military capability and underestimated Ukraine’s will and the power of U.S. military aid. But where Vietnam was a marginal geopolitical issue for the U.S., Ukraine is a fundamental geopolitical one for Russia because it increases its strategic depth. Similarly, Ukraine, like Vietnam, is not an existential issue for the U.S., which obviously was never in any danger of being occupied by the enemy. A settlement that preserves the Russian nation is clearly possible geopolitically, but political considerations muddy the waters. Like the U.S., Russia has to protect its status as a great power while managing its internal political tensions. (Tensions were much more visible in the U.S. during the Vietnam War than they are now in Russia, but they are present nonetheless.) The negotiations to end the war in Ukraine are a matter of engineering, and unlike geopolitics, engineering is diplomacy, and thus, it is personal and political.<br>Russia invaded Ukraine but failed to achieve its goal of regaining a substantial buffer. Putin’s political imperative is to end the war, but without appearing to have capitulated or failed. He must therefore emerge from the talks by appearing not to have been forced into a settlement – ideally by gaining significant concessions. Thus, he is demanding substantial territorial concessions from Ukraine, territories that Russia has not conquered or had to retreat from.<br>Having repelled Russia from its initial attack on Kyiv and other crucial areas, Ukraine can accept the loss of the territories that Russia now holds but cannot voluntarily turn over territories Russia hasn’t taken, or ones it has failed to hold. More than a matter of pride, Ukraine cannot afford to surrender these lands for fear of later Russian reprisals at more favorable geographic positions.<br>For its part, the U.S. wants to unburden itself of the global security obligations it assumed after World War II. It sees the situation in Ukraine, then, as a good opportunity to reduce its commitment to and vulnerability in Europe. The U.S. wants to end the war in a way that confirms Russia’s limits. Washington has no inherent interest in Ukraine, but it sees Ukraine’s successful defense of itself as validation that the U.S. no longer needs to defend Europe.<br>Trump’s role is to engineer this outcome. A settlement is something that Russia can’t readily accept because it would confirm Russian weakness and, in this case, Putin’s failures. He will be held responsible for launching a war that he did not win, that cost many lives, and that severely damaged the Russian economy. At the same time, Zelenskyy cannot simply make concessions for a rapid settlement because he led a successful resistance (also at the cost of many lives). And Trump cannot allow Russia to emerge as victorious; his decision to disengage from Europe is predicated on the assumption that Russia is no longer a threat to Europe, at least not one that Europe can’t handle on its own.<br>Russia’s negotiation tactic will be to show that it has not been defeated, and that it is prepared to continue the war, even as it uses the war’s protraction as a means of extracting territorial concessions. He will try to let the pressure fall on Trump, who is under political stress at home and abroad to deliver the peace he promised. Having also claimed an understanding with Putin on ending the war, and also publicly made clear his leverage over Zelenskyy, Trump cannot appear to have been taken in by Putin.<br>The question now is what Putin would concede, openly or tacitly, that would allow him to seem to have won in the negotiations, and whether Trump would trust anything he promises. Trump has the option, as Putin knows, to declare the talks a failure and temporarily reengage in European defense by ordering more weapons and technology to be sent to Ukraine to block Russia. And all of this will hinge to some degree on whether the Russian political system – the public, the oligarchs and so on – will tolerate the loss of more soldiers and money.<br>Every course of action carries political risk. Zelenskyy will find it difficult to make territorial concessions after having spent so much blood in the war. Putin will have a hard time justifying three years of fighting with little to show for it. Trump will have a hard time being unable to execute a deal.<br>In my mind – and this is not a prediction because engineering is not predictable – this ends when Trump makes a credible threat to intervene militarily in some massive way, perhaps with troops, if Putin continues his aggressive stance. European military intervention is not only unlikely but also not politically and militarily possible. Therefore, the question is when will Trump make a threat of massive intervention so credible that Putin would have to accept failure.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R196" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">197</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/23/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ÔI THẮNG LỢI VĨ ĐẠI CỦA TRUMP:<br>CHO NHẬT BẢN ĐƯỢC CỨU THÉP MỸ<br>Ít ai đọc kỹ tin này - hoặc tìm hiểu sâu xa hơn về kỹ nghệ thép từ mấy chục năm trước - để thấy Trump bần thần, gật đầu, rồi lắc và nay lại gật để coi đó là công lao của mình. <br>Nên sẽ lại chụp hình rất huê dạng!<br>https://www.wsj.com/.../nippon-us-steel-deal-trump...<br>Business - Deals<br>Trump to Allow Nippon-U.S. Steel Deal to Move Forward<br>Japanese company pitched new American plant and billions of dollars in additional investments to win support from Washington<br>(By Bob Tita and Lauren Thomas - WSJ - May 23, 2025 8:48 pm ET)<br>U.S. Steel&#39;s Edgar Thomson Plant in Braddock, Pennsylvania.<br>U.S. Steel’s Edgar Thomson Plant in Braddock, Pa. Photo: Gene J. Puskar/AP<br>Key Points - What&#39;s This?<br>* Trump conditionally approved Nippon Steel’s U.S. Steel takeover, defining it as a partnership with key details pending.<br>* The deal, opposed by Biden and initially by Trump, could reshape the U.S. steel industry with Nippon investing in U.S. Steel’s plants.<br>*  U.S. Steel shares rose 21%; Nippon pledges no layoffs through 2026. It is aiming to offset declining sales in Japan.<br>Key aspects of the deal still need to be ironed out. But Trump’s announcement signaled that the Tokyo-based company could eventually enter the American steel market and make the big investments envisioned when it reached a $14.1 billion deal to take over U.S. Steel. <br>Trump defined the agreement as a partnership, spurring some confusion at the companies on Friday afternoon, according to people involved in the deal talks. Both Nippon and U.S. Steel were seeking more guidance from the administration about how much ownership Nippon could ultimately gain. <br>In a post on Truth Social Friday, Trump said the partnership between the two companies would result in at least 70,000 jobs, and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. The bulk of that investment will occur in the next 14 months, the post said. <br>“For many years, the name, ‘United States Steel’ was synonymous with Greatness, and now, it will be again,” said the post, adding that the company’s headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh. Trump plans to visit U.S. Steel’s operations in the city for a May 30 rally. <br>White House officials didn’t immediately respond to inquiries about the deal’s terms. <br>The announcement represented a remarkable turn for a controversial transcontinental deal that had been opposed by both Trump and former President Joe Biden, who moved to block it in January before Trump took office and rekindled discussions with the companies. The deal could also reshape the American steel industry, adding a deep-pocketed backer for U.S. Steel, whose older mills have been hurt by years of losses and deferred maintenance.<br>Nippon Steel’s investment plan, mentioned by Trump, confirmed reports in The Wall Street Journal and other outlets. Major projects already pledged include equipment upgrades at plants in Gary, Ind., and near Pittsburgh. The company has also committed to build a new steel mill at an undetermined location. <br>Nippon Steel and the Trump administration are working to complete a national-security agreement in the coming weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br>President Trump and Prime Minister Ishiba at a joint press conference.<br>President Trump held a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in February to discuss the steel companies. Photo: Hu Yousong/Zuma Press<br>Investors treated the announcement as though a big hurdle had been cleared. Shares in U.S. Steel gained more than 21% to $52.01 in Friday trading. For months, the stock traded at a steep discount to Nippon Steel’s $55-a-share offer, reflecting skepticism that a deal would clear regulatory hurdles.<br>Shares in U.S. Steel rivals faltered. Cleveland-Cliffs declined 7%, with Steel Dynamics down 3.5% and Nucor down 2%.<br>Executives at Nippon Steel, the world’s fourth-largest steelmaker, have pushed for full ownership of U.S. Steel. They argued that the large expenditures in equipment and steelmaking technology wouldn’t be possible without owning the whole company.<br>Still, the announcement from Trump was considered “good news” by the people close to the deal, who said it put Nippon a step closer to completing a transaction, without calling it one, which the president wanted to avoid.<br>In separate statements, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel commended the president and his efforts to protect American workers and industry. “President Trump is a bold leader and businessman who knows how to get the best deal for America, American workers and American manufacturing,” U.S. Steel said in a statement. <br>Trump had previously opposed the takeover proposed by the Japanese steelmaker, saying that U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned. The president signaled openness earlier this year to Nippon investing in but not owning U.S. Steel. <br>Over the past few months, Nippon Steel executives have met several times with Trump administration officials in Washington to outline their plans and spending commitments. <br>A new negotiating window opened between the administration and Trump when he ordered a second national-security assessment of the deal in April. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, sent its report to Trump this week.<br>The president typically has 15 days to act once Cfius issues its report. Nippon Steel had a deadline of its own: its merger agreement with U.S. Steel had been set to expire June 18, though the deadline could be extended. <br>Nippon Steel topped competing offers for the storied U.S. company with its blockbuster bid. Since then, Nippon Steel has touted investment pledges in U.S. Steel’s plants to win over skeptical union leaders, mayors and politicians. <br>The United Steelworkers union had been steadfast in its opposition to the deal. The union has accused Nippon Steel of undermining the American steel market for decades by selling unfairly low-price imports. <br>“Our concern remains that Nippon, a foreign corporation with a long and proven record of violating our trade laws, will further erode domestic steelmaking capacity and jeopardize thousands of good, union jobs,” USW President Dave McCall said Friday. <br>Nippon Steel pledged to honor the union’s bargaining agreements with U.S. Steel and refrain from layoffs and plant closings through the end of the current contract in 2026. <br>The company is keen on adding the U.S. business to help offset declining sales in Japan.<br>U.S. Steel, which generated nearly $16 billion in sales last year, primarily supplies sheet steel to the automotive, appliance and construction industries.<br>Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com and Lauren Thomas at lauren.thomas@wsj.com<br>Copyright ©2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)<br>The culture of Western society is Judeo-Christian. Its respect for individuals, its humanitarian morality, the need for empirical evidence, and entreaties such as &quot;Love thy neighbor as thyself&quot;&#39; (Leviticus 19:18) - echoed by Mark and Matthew in the New Testament - are the values that have formed the foundation for all education in the West.<br>As we have seen, however, as recently as this week, however, when two young innocent staffers at the Israeli Embassy in Washington D.C., were gunned down, there have been increasing attacks on these Judeo-Christian social values. Both anarchistic revolutionaries and many religious zealots apparently wish to eradicate and replace them, presumably on the way to a world order featuring themselves.<br>The Italian Marxist, Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937), instructed his supporters: [Tây Phương không nhớ, nên LẠI phải dạy!]<br>    &quot;Socialism is precisely the religion that must overwhelm Christianity. In the new Order, Socialism will triumph by first capturing the culture through infiltration of schools, universities, Churches, and the media by transforming the consciousness of society.&quot;<br>In the neo-Marxist view of these ideologues, &quot;Everything must be thrown into the supposedly great cause of social justice,&quot; as First Things editor R. R. Reno wrote. Social justice, according to them, incorporates the division of society into tribal, allegedly oppressed, racial, religious or gender-driven groups such as Black Lives Matter, pro-Palestinian groups, LGBTQ+ and so on. White males, for instance, are accused of &quot;toxic masculinity,&quot; of benefitting from &quot;white privilege&quot; and of being &quot;settler-colonialists,&quot; and are required to repent for a supposedly sinful status they were never given an opportunity to select.<br>In his books &quot;The Madness of Crowds and The War on the West&quot;, [Ít ai đọc – trừ những ai đã sống và chứng kiến chế độ độc tài toàn trị, từ bên trong!] social commentator Douglas Murray notes that &quot;contemporary social justice movements often operate less as genuine quests for justice and more as vehicles for retribution or revenge.&quot;<br>In the formerly sacred halls of academia, traditional standards of social conduct, empirical biology, merit and achievement, facts, fairness and justice - with some sort of due process and respect for others - are irrelevant. What instead seems to be considered important is the great new cause to refabricate society in accordance with a skewed view of social justice, that consists not of individuals but identity groups, and that decides which of those may, or may not, be members of some private global &quot;club.&quot; No wonder Western society, especially in Europe, seems to be bordering on implosion.<br>&quot;The Jewish people brought morality to the world thousands of years ago and some people are still mad about it,&quot; remarked, Safra Catz, CEO of technology giant Oracle, by way of diagnosing the open resurgence of Jew-hatred and anti-Judeo-Christian vitriol in Western societies.<br>The most recent wave of protests can be traced to the contemporary infiltration of Marxism, with its fixed view of the world as oppressors vs. oppressed, combined with increasing Muslim Jew-hate. The latter is being funded lavishly throughout both higher and lower education by Qatar and other Islamist proselytizing supporters of &quot;dawah&quot;: inviting both Muslims and non-Muslims to understand the worship of God (Allah) as taught in the Qur&#39;an and the Sunnah (traditions of Islam&#39;s Prophet Muhammad), and to inform them about the teachings and example of Muhammad.<br>The success of Israel in defeating at least some centuries-old jihadist terrorism, which no Western nation would - or should - tolerate, has resulted in vociferous protests in the West. The attitude often seems to be: &quot;How dare those settler-colonialists succeed against a minority. This is not social justice.&quot; Never mind that the Jews have resided on that land for nearly 4,000 years, or that the &quot;minority&quot; is not only bellicose but bloodthirsty, and that if this &quot;minority&quot; is oppressed, it is by their own leaders, not the Jews.<br>The plan by President Donald J. Trump to resurrect American civil rights laws that advocate colorblind equality and merit seems to have invigorated his domestic opposition.<br>To many, however, the eradication of a racist belief-system - one that has devastated Western culture, governments and universities while dividing friends and families, and confusing the gender identity of countless vulnerable youths – could not come soon enough.<br>What they assumed they had been witnessing was the destruction of civilization from within. It was proposed in a May 22, 1991 Muslim Brotherhood document entitled &quot;An Explanatory Memorandum On the General Strategic Goal for the Group In North America,&quot; written by an acolyte of the late Sheikh Yusuf al Qaradawi, who was head of the European Council for Fatwa and Research:<br>    &quot;The Ikhwan [Muslim Brotherhood] must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and &#39;sabotaging&#39; its miserable house by their hands and by the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God&#39;s religion is made victorious over all other religions.&quot;<br>The promotion of racial policies, initiated by the US government under President Barack Obama, then cemented under President Joe Biden, appeared to have become ingrained again in public life. [Quá đúng!]<br>It was probably to be expected with the election of President Donald J. Trump, and with the fearless leadership of Israel&#39;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that a repudiation of those policies by opponents in both countries, would focus all their resources on bringing these two statesmen down.<br>A favorite tactic now seems to be the practice of &quot;lawfare&quot; – employing legal procedural tools, usually targeting process, to frustrate efforts by the elected executive, in both the US and Israel, to carry out the mandates for which voters had elected them.<br>Netanyahu, commenting on the highly-suspect criminal charges against him, recently wrote:<br>    &quot;In America and in Israel, when a strong right wing leader wins an election, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people&#39;s will.&quot;<br>Netanyahu has been facing persecution by his opponents - through legal channels and the media - determined to remove him from office so that their policies, not voted for, can resume. During Israel&#39;s current struggle for its existence on many battlefronts, the trial court has insisted that Netanyahu continually make himself available for hours a day, several days a week, for cross-examination on charges that appear politically motivated and not to be holding up impressively in court - to the detriment of Netanyahu&#39;s ability properly to prosecute a war that threatens Israel&#39;s survival. The prime minister has been compelled to attend court on many days while this 7-front attack on a country smaller than New Jersey is raging on Israel&#39;s borders.<br>After the completion of the evidentiary stage in &quot;Case 4000&quot; - that has persisted for ten years - pertaining to a corruption charge, two of the PM&#39;s aides, in a criminal case having nothing to do with Netanyahu - were arrested on further charges of involvement in assisting Qatar. Netanyahu himself said in April:<br>    &quot;This is a political witch-hunt aimed solely at one thing - preventing the dismissal of the head of the Shin Bet and bringing about the downfall of a right-wing prime minister.&quot;<br>In March 2025, Israel&#39;s governing Likud Party accused the Attorney General of &quot;concocting false cases&quot; in charging the prime minister and his staff of supposed corruption:<br>    &quot;As the cases concocted against Prime Minister Netanyahu crumble in court, new and false cases are concocted against his people out of the personal interests of those leading the investigation.&quot;<br>Netanyahu filed a defamation lawsuit against Yair Golan, leader of one of Israel&#39;s opposition parties, regarding messages he had sent to supporters accusing the PM of peddling the country&#39;s security for money from Qatar.<br>For years before October 7, 2023, Netanyahu, as well as Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Prime Minister Yair Lapid, had permitted Qatar to fund the Gaza Strip&#39;s Hamas rulers with $30 million a month, in the hope, it seems, that if Hamas felt financially comfortable, it would remain quiet. This was similar to Biden&#39;s policy toward Iran. The Biden administration disregarded sanctions, enriching Iran with approximately $100 billion - which the Iranian regime then used for funding its proxies to attack Israel.<br>The supposed quiet between Gaza and Israel before October 7 2023, one which Hamas had gone to great lengths in order to lull Israel into complacency, was solidly in place. A few years earlier, for instance, when Gaza&#39;s Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist group attacked Israel, Hamas deliberately did not join, claiming it was now interested only in building security and peace.<br>As Netanyahu&#39;s detractors bring one charge after the other in a continual attempt to bring him down, one cannot but wonder who Israel&#39;s real enemies actually are.<br>It appears that some prominent politicians and high-level officials are possibly prepared to destroy their own nation in pursuit of their ambitions for power, and to impose their own ideologies on its people. Netanyahu and others no doubt see through their bogus proclamations they are &quot;protecting democracy.&quot; Their actions are anything but. As Netanyahu stated recently, compared to Israel&#39;s deep state, America&#39;s is &quot;a puddle.&quot;<br>Trump has also been forced to contend with countless legal challenges, all of which, so far, he has overcome. Upon his re-election, in command once again, his first actions were to issue executive orders eliminating all woke policies in government departments and federal agencies. Hundreds of officials have been dismissed; and whole departments and agencies shut down to eradicate divisive racist policies that are so damaging to the innovation, growth and democratic nature of America.<br>As in Israel, Trump and his newly appointed officials have been facing numerous legal challenges to prevent policies he was elected to implement, but that to many seem intolerable.<br>More than 119 of the Trump&#39;s directives have faced legal challenges, mainly, it seems, in cases presided over by partisan judges in cherry-picked district courts, who hold to a &quot;progressive&quot; outlook. In April 2025, for instance, a district court judge ordered the government to &quot;re-import an MS-13 member they deported,&quot; Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal alien, who had been convicted and ordered deported but had been granted a stay, which held until his criminal gang was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, at which point the stay no longer legally applied.<br>Columnist Matt Vespa reported in April:<br>    &quot;These judges are getting out of control. That&#39;s becoming an unfortunate evergreen statement ever since members of this gavel Gestapo have decided to engage in a campaign to wrest away authority explicitly outlined for the executive on numerous areas, like immigration policy. It&#39;s reached new levels of absurdity.&quot;<br>Now that an ultra-socialist sector of the Democratic Party has publicly come forth, something that, in the words of Stanley Kurtz in National Review, reveals that &quot;Explicit leftist radicalism is so deeply rooted in the party that efforts to disguise it are at once unavoidable and impossible&quot; - the future of the party looks dim. The majority of America voted against these destructive tribalist theories, seemingly based on circumstances over which the bearer had no control, such as skin color, gender and ethnicity, rather hard work or merit, when they elected a determined Trump to the presidency.<br>The battle against for truth, morality and freedom, however, begun in antiquity, will likely continue.<br>&quot;Hate never wins the final victory,&quot; said the late UK Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, &quot;freedom does&quot; - the freedom of respect for one another and to &quot;love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot;</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R198" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">199</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/23/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump has approved Nippon Steel&#39;s deal for U.S. Steel, White House sources said Friday.<br><br>Trump&#39;s decision clears the way for the deal to go forward nearly a year and a half since it was announced.

These South Africans assembled in front of the American Embassy in Pretoria Feb. 15 to thank President Trump for recognizing the genocide in their country.<br>This is a sequel of sorts to my blog of May 20, now titled “How World War II Created the Cultural Matrix of Today’s World,” though its original title was far less compelling.<br>I again address the issues raised in that post because I think that Jonathan Pageau, whose video sparked my comments, has pinned the tail on the donkey, as it were. (If you wish to connect that image with the mascot of the Democrat Party, I won’t stop you.)<br>In summary: In World War II, the United States and Great Britain allied with Stalin’s Soviet Union to defeat Hitler and the Nazis. All well and good, and wholly uncriticized until quite recently, when at last people from cultural observers to stand-up comedians are noticing what was there all along, hidden in plain sight: That in allying with Stalin, we partnered with a dictator whose evil equaled that of Hitler. Stalin’s Soviet Union not only murdered millions of citizens whose politics it didn&#39;t like (20 million is a conservative number) it signed a peace pact with Nazi Germany for the first two years of the war, 1939-41, leaving France, Poland, the USA and the UK to twist in the wind. The Communists were not good guys, not by any stretch of the imagination. They might never have fought the Nazis at all had Hitler not exposed his terminal insanity by declaring war on them, opening up a second front that guaranteed his defeat.<br>[Khi du học tại Paris, tôi chứng kiến chuyện đó: từ 1939 tới 1941 đảng Cộng sản Pháp hợp tác với Đức Quốc Xã, tên Tổng bí thư Maurice Thorez thì lưu vong tại Moscow và bị Lực lượng Kháng chiến Pháp kết án tử hình! Tới khi Hitler tấn công Liên Xô thì cộng sản Pháp mới… tham gia kháng chiến chống Đức, để cấp cứu “tổ quốc xã hội chủ nghĩa” là Liên bang Xô viết. Nhiều người cộng sản Pháp chẳng biết chuyện đó, khi tôi nêu ra là đòi đánh lộn – mà lại thua!]<br>So, what does this have to do with today’s political culture? Here’s a video from conservative commentator Matt Walsh, explaining how he has been branded a Nazi for reposting a critical comment that included a photo purportedly containing the hidden image of a swastika. Mind you, Walsh did not himself post the photo, he merely reposted it in order to answer the critic who did post it. But he’s the one being called a Nazi.<br>Here is the foundational consensus of post-WWII culture: Even the most tangential, the most hard-to-spot association with anything thought to be possibly Nazi-ish, including when the so-called “evidence” originates somewhere else, and… BANG you are Hermann Goering! If the image Walsh is accused of championing had contained a hidden hammer and sickle instead of a swastika, he would be in the clear. It’s okay to be an out-and-out Communist - they were our allies in World War II, you know? - but it’s not okay to step anywhere near the vicinity of Naziism, even inadvertently.<br>The myth works like this: The Soviet Union helped defeat the Nazis (the Russians claim they did it virtually by themselves, perhaps to deflect blame from having collaborated with Hitler) so they are good guys. We were good guys too, but… not anymore. Why? Because we have Western values, and the Nazis held Western - read, “white” - values above others and imposed them on other cultures. The latter is not true, the Nazis were viciously anti-Western and murdered millions of white people. Why do you think they gassed 6 million Jews, whose religion is the foundation of all Western spiritual belief? But the facts here don’t matter; only belief systems matter, and the belief system of the WWII myth says that the Communists were the real good guys, while the Western powers were essentially in sympathy with the Nazis but just wanted power over Europe. It’s a perfect reversal of the truth: Instead of us allying with evil to fight evil, the Leftist reading has the “good” Soviet Union allying with the “evil” West (for purely temporary and pragmatic reasons, of course).<br>A simplistic reading of the Left-Right political spectrum helps underwrite the lie. Nazis were supposedly on “the Right” (they weren’t, but you can’t fight consensus) and the Soviets on “the Left.” Now America is said to be on the Right, therefore (goes the WWII myth) everything American must be opposed. This applies especially to America’s majority population of European descent. The cry is everywhere that “White supremacy is the greatest threat to our democracy,” yet no evidence, neither empirical nor statistical, comes near that assertion. It is believed because it is cognate with the post-WWII moral consensus.<br>Not a week goes by that some brainless worshipper of the WWII consensus calls President Trump “Hitler.” Last week it was stupid Larry David, this week it’s the bullying, arrogant former vice-president Al Gore. David and Gore assert that deporting criminal aliens is the same as murdering millions of innocent people, that striving for peace is the same thing as making war, and that reducing the power of the government is the same as making government your overlord. (If this sounds familiar, credit a man who saw the WWII myth as it was being manufactured: George Orwell.) They are safeguarded in these statements by the millions of people who have neither the time nor the skills to think past what they are fed by the culture. They follow only one rule: The consensus/myth must be never be questioned; all moral and political judgements must stem from belief in it.<br>And it is everywhere. The obscenity of Pravda - a k a The New York Times - calling President Trump’s claim that white South Africans are the victims of a genocidal plan false, when evidence to the contrary exists, is statist pseudo-journalism at its finest. If Pravda (The NY Times) employed actual journalists, they would treat the president’s remarks as an honest claim and present his evidence alongside any evidence to the contrary, allowing readers to make up their own minds. But that would contradict the belief system of the WWII consensus. White people are always oppressors, never victims. Reverse that for people of color.<br>Pageau seems to think that the consensus is at last fading. More public intellectuals are pointing out the evil of the Leftist Soviet Union and rejecting the easy judgements made available by the post-WWII belief system. Here’s hoping. I suppose epochal myths must run their course, and that there is little to be done but wait. Even so, I find myself wondering how much longer this can go on without doing permanent damage to what remains of the Western world. I daydream about yanking a lever labelled, “Pull to Wake the WOKE.”</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R202" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">203</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">‘THUẬT QUỶ BIỂN’ LÀ “PERCEPTION MANIPULATION”!<br>Canada đã dùng mưu thuật đó, với sự hỗ trợ của Bắc Kinh, để đưa Mark Carney lên thay Justin Trudeau.

In the 2025 Canadian federal election, the Trudeau Liberals - under new leader Mark Carney - knowingly amplified a far-fetched threat of American annexation to frame the race as a battle for national survival. Voters were told that Donald Trump wanted to “break and own” Canada. What they weren’t told was that Carney had privately reassured Trump that his heated stump speech rhetoric was just for show.<br>If it weren’t so chilling, it might read as farce - poorly acted political theatre at the highest level.<br>A few events, in retrospect, appear as the keystones of what may have been a coordinated, disinformation-driven campaign. A campaign, with the benefit of hindsight, that dovetailed precisely with Chinese intelligence narratives.<br>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, days before stepping down and apparently ‘feathering a pass’ to Mark Carney - a hockey metaphor that never surfaced in the subsequent ‘elbows up’ campaign - appeared at a Toronto business summit and, conveniently, was caught on a “hot mic.” He warned, in casual tones, that Donald Trump “very much” wanted Canada’s resources, and that “absorbing our country” was “a real thing.” The timing was surgical.<br>Equally suspicious was Canada’s UN Ambassador and long-time Liberal heavyweight Bob Rae posting a distorted Arctic map on X, showing Canada and Greenland fully swallowed by a U.S. flag. His caption: “Theft by force.”<br>The narrative had been cast: the United States was preparing to take Canada. The Liberals would defend the nation. And anyone who doubted that premise was complicit in national surrender.<br>It began with an offhand comment at Mar-a-Lago in late 2024 -Trump joking that if Canada couldn’t meet its defense commitments, perhaps it should become the 51st state. By January, the joke had mutated into a real threat: Trump threatened 25% tariffs on Canadian goods and linked them to Canada’s failure to secure its borders. The Liberals seized on the moment.<br>Then came the hot mic leak.<br>In February, Prime Minister Trudeau, in a supposedly closed-door session, was caught warning that Trump’s “annexation” ambitions were “a real thing.” The remark was conveniently on-message, almost too perfectly timed as Carney prepared to take the reins. By March, with Trump’s tariffs in force and sovereignty rhetoric rising, B.C. Premier David Eby declared Trump was “campaigning against Canada’s independence.”<br>On March 15, Bob Rae posted his now-infamous map depicting Canada fully absorbed into the U.S. It wasn’t just visual. His accompanying tweet read:<br>“To emphasize, this is not about borders, or fentanyl. This is about a colossal land, water and resource grab. The tariffs are intended to weaken so this theft can take place. We’re not talking ‘purchase’ or ‘buying’. We’re talking theft by force. Fighting back will be hard, but it is the fight of our lives.”<br>Rae, a senior diplomat, had crossed the line into domestic campaign messaging. And it aligned perfectly with the pitch Carney was about to make.<br>Carney, newly installed as prime minister, wasted no time launching the “Elbows Up” campaign - framing the Liberals as the last line of defense against American imperialism. At every rally, Trump was the villain. Carney told Canadians, “We are in a fight for our country.”<br>Apparently, Beijing was too.<br>On April 7, 2025, the Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections (SITE) Task Force reported that Chinese state-affiliated accounts on WeChat had launched a coordinated “information operation” targeting the Canadian election. These accounts consistently amplified narratives portraying Carney as a principled defender of Canadian sovereignty against Trump’s alleged annexation ambitions. The operation, linked to the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, was assessed to have likely influenced Chinese-Canadian communities in key ridings - potentially swaying votes.<br>Meanwhile, just days after Carney’s incendiary rhetoric began, he engaged in a private call with President Trump. According to CBC reporting, Trump once again raised the 51st-state concept. Carney made no mention of it in the official government readout. Only after CBC brought the issue to light did he publicly acknowledge that the annexation idea had, in fact, been raised.<br>Notably, this disclosure appeared to give new momentum to the Liberal campaign’s annexation narrative - despite indications that Trump had begun moderating his tone. What CBC’s report did not include, however - if one accepts as credible a subsequent account from National Post columnist John Ivison - was arguably more consequential. Ivison reported that during the same call, Carney assured Trump that the anti-Trump messaging was a strategic necessity, not a personal indictment, and further characterized Trump as a “transformational” leader. In public, Carney framed Trump as a direct threat to Canadian sovereignty. In private, according to this reporting, he extended praise.<br>The contrast was cemented after the vote.<br>On April 28, the Liberals secured a strong minority government. Carney celebrated by declaring, “Donald Trump wants to break us, so that America can own us.” But less than a week later, standing beside Trump in the Oval Office, Carney dropped the defiance. He called Trump “transformational,” credited him for tackling fentanyl, and pledged Canada would be a good partner. By mid-May, he confirmed Canada was in talks to join Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile shield.<br>Notably, the region invoked by Bob Rae’s tweet - the Arctic and Canadian North - sits squarely within the strategic focus of that same U.S. missile defense system. On May 21, China’s foreign ministry lashed out at the Golden Dome project, calling it a threat and urging Washington to abandon it. The Liberal campaign had warned Canadians of U.S. ambitions to seize Canadian land and militarize the Arctic - yet Carney now aligns with the very policy China condemns most. The contradiction is stark, and telling.<br>The question isn’t whether Trump’s actions posed a real challenge to Canada. His tariffs and rhetoric were aggressive and unprecedented. The question is whether the Carney Liberals exaggerated that threat, weaponized fear, and manipulated public sentiment to win an election - only to reverse course immediately after.<br>If that’s the case, then a more unsettling question follows: can Mark Carney’s pledges - either to Donald Trump or to the Canadian people - be trusted going forward?<br>The Canadian people were told they were voting to protect sovereignty. In reality, they voted for a narrative. The real strategy - only visible now - was to create a crisis, stoke national anxiety, and cast Carney as a saviour.<br>Canada faces real threats: hostile state networks, aggressive election interference from Beijing, economic sabotage, and intellectual property theft. The take-down of Nortel by Huawei still resonates globally as a cautionary tale. Fentanyl trafficking from Canadian soil is rising. At the same time, there is growing consensus that Canada must finally unleash its vast natural resources to strengthen its geopolitical position. What matters now is not whether Mark Carney can win votes - but whether he can govern.<br>He campaigned on the word build.

Là vì cách uốn éo để tìm ra những lý do phi lý thay vì nói ra sự bệnh hoạn trong tâm trí ươn hèn: trừng phạt Tesla vì Elon Musk ủng hộ Trump - khác chi bọn cực tả gọi nhau đốt xe Tesla vì lý do chính trị!<br>https://jonathanturley.org/.../oh-canada-teslas.../...<br>Oh Canada: Teslas Banned from the International Car Show<br>(Jonathan Turley - International - May 23, 2025) <br>If you go to the Vancouver International Auto Show, you can see all the new models. However, if you want to see a Tesla, you must go down the road to check out a car without a political litmus test. The organizers are just the latest group to join the mob retaliating against Elon Musk for working with the Trump Administration to remove waste and fraud in government through his DOGE program. What was most striking was the pathetic rationalization of the organization for engaging in political retaliation.<br>According to the Canadian Auto Dealer, the organizers claimed a common rationalization for political discrimination: security. As we have seen on college campuses for years, where conservative speakers are barred due to security concerns, the Canadians claimed that they could not protect innocent parties if a single Tesla was allowed on the floor. Furthermore, they blamed Tesla, insisting the company was given “multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw.”<br>In other words, we only cancelled Musk when he refused to cancel himself.<br>Tesla already had a booth set up and had to take it down.<br>So, the solution to extremists is to give them precisely what they demand.<br>After all, some on the left are committing political violence and claiming that they were triggered by the mere appearance of Teslas or other symbols. This week, another person wearing a MAGA hat was assaulted. The woman was triggered by the hat on the head of a 72-year-old man so she attacked him.<br>The Canadians appear willing collaborators in this retaliation. Rather than simply posting proper security, they banished the victim of the political violence. By blaming it on Tesla, they can throw up their hands and say “we tried” but Tesla was unreasonable.<br>It is the same rationalization heard from those arrested for political violence.<br>For example, Natasha Cohen, 46, a New York therapist, was arrested for vandalizing Teslas and explained that she is “living in terror every day.” It is a familiar refrain as the rise in political violence becomes undeniable. On Friday, New York Times Chief White House Correspondent and MSNBC Political Analyst Peter Baker came under fire for admitting that leftist violence is on the rise, but noting that Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric “might excite people to take action.”<br>Cohen explained that it is all Elon’s fault:<br>    “Every time I see those cars, I see Elon Musk saluting the country as a Nazi…I made a mistake because I’m basically living in terror every day that the country is turning into Nazi Germany. I’m truly terrified, because Elon was unelected and they’re deporting migrants without a trial.”<br>However, people like Cohen are now safe from being triggered at the Vancouver International Auto Show. The organizers are only banning those who refuse to ban themselves.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R205" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">206</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">SỢ ĐỜI QUÊN, TRUMP LẠI LÊN CƠN HÓA DẠI!<br>Dọa tăng thuế suất 50% trên hàng nhập nội của Liên Âu và nhiều trò vớ vẩn khác.

Trump yells at Walmart. Wannabe citizens compete on reality TV. DOGE fumbles. Dems can’t find their Joe Rogan. And much more.<br>By Nellie Bowles - The Free Press - 05.23.25 - TGIF<br>Listen to Article<br>26 mins<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Welcome back. I loved meeting some of you at the San Francisco debate, where I handed out VIP wristbands to anyone who complimented my cropped trousers - which in SF is as close as we get to shorts - or who brought a book for me to sign (any book, I just like being asked to write my name). Let’s turn to the news.<br>→ The Biden aging cover-up: There’s a big new book out by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson on how Biden World covered up Biden’s senility, and nuggets from it have dominated the headlines all week. Biden’s campaign staged a simple town hall to get some good clips of him talking, and he couldn’t even muster coherent lines; members of Biden’s cabinet wouldn’t see him for months at a time; Hunter Biden was effectively “the chief of staff” for the Biden family. (Commander, the German shepherd, ran our Navy.)<br>Biden’s deterioration was profound, was visible as early as 2019, and was systematically hidden by a media that simply wanted to guzzle and regurgitate propaganda. Biden’s inner circle reportedly couldn’t believe how easily the mainstream media swallowed campaign lies, with one anonymous insider saying: “We were sort of amazed at some of the stuff we were able to spin. You guys should not have believed us so easily.”<br>And wow, did the media fall for the Biden White House spin. They loved it!<br>CNN blasted: “Fact check: Trump campaign runs ads falsely accusing Biden of using teleprompter.” The Associated Press writes confidently: “Biden did not use teleprompter to answer reporters’ questions.” Jen Psaki in 2021: “I can tell you, having traveled with him a fair amount, sometimes he’s hard to keep up with.” Well, maybe when he’s being pushed in his chair by a younger staffer. Here’s The New York Times in 2023: “Yet people who deal with him regularly, including some of his adversaries, say he remains sharp and commanding in private meetings.... He has at times exhibited striking stamina.” Hot. He’s literally Benson Boone, a virile, strapping man so fit it’s impossible for any woman to match the pace of his stride, according to the paper of record. He did a cartwheel, you just missed it. All videos showing what you think is a totally zonked old man are actually “cheap fakes.” (Remember that? Real video, but bad vibes, so the media called ‘em cheap fakes.) People have collected more greatest mainstream hits if you like that kind of thing. Here are all the good and trusted talking heads tearing into Special Counsel Robert Hur, for example, for having the audacity to suggest Biden was pretty out of it.<br>Some of the book tour has been profoundly uncomfortable. Here’s Tapper: “Alex and I are here to say that conservative media was right and conservative media was correct and that there should be a lot of soul-searching, not just among me, but among the legacy media.” It’s the kind of self-flagellation that would make Opus Dei proud.<br>→ Prostate cancer damage control: A few days ahead of the book launch, Team Biden announced that he had Stage 4 prostate cancer. Was it damage control? Probably. Did they think they could use it to undercut criticism? Well, maybe a little. Did it work? Let’s see.<br>Longtime Dem strategist David Axelrod certainly assumed it would work. He said comments related to the book about Biden’s mental acuity “should be more muted and set aside for now as he’s struggling through this.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says it’s inappropriate to ask questions about Biden’s age and health, and wondering about the timing of this announcement is conspiratorial: “Seems to me entirely inappropriate that at this moment in time when President Biden is dealing with a serious and aggressive form of cancer, there are Republicans who are peddling conspiracy theories.” And then Barack Obama thought it was the right moment to announce that Joe Biden is the world’s greatest scientist. He tweeted, “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe.”<br>Now I guess the last question to ask, and get your conspiracy flags ready and up is: How long did the White House know Biden had prostate cancer? And how much did they do to hide it? Here’s Zeke Emanuel, an oncologist and a brother of Rahm, on MSNBC saying the obvious: “He did not develop it in the last, 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency, in 2021. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any disagreement about that.” Can I just say (putting aside the fact that I believe in every single conspiracy here), there’s a certain indignity in being president that is so sad. He’s 80 years old, of course he has prostate cancer. All old men have prostate cancer. I assume all politicians have crazy things going on inside them and frankly I don’t need to know the details.<br>→ What’s the latest, Mr. President? And returning from a huge trip to the Middle East, President Trump, as far as regards Middle East policy goals on a 20-year time horizon and a reimagining of the JCPOA, had this to say on Truth Social:<br>“Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’ ”<br>→ Did you think it meant vibes? Someone opened fire on a group outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., murdering two young Israeli Embassy staffers, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. They were walking into an event for young professionals and the diplomatic community. While being handcuffed, our alleged new terrorist chanted “Free, Free Palestine.” Or as the mainstream media put it the next day: agencies are “seeking a motive.”<br>The alleged killer, Elias Rodriguez, was apparently a longtime leftist, and a few groups have come out to laud their soldier. Unity of Fields, an “anti-imperialist propaganda front” in the new anti-Zionist movement, is already selling a little booklet: Escalate for Gaza, Bring the War Home. They slapped the image of a machine gun and the name “Elias Rodriguez” to the front just in case you weren’t sure what they meant, which is kill people. Another vocal group in the “pro-Palestine” marches across New York City posted this:<br>They’re not wrong. Shooting up a Jewish museum is probably the highest expression of anti-Zionism. Unity of Fields also mocked those who condemn the killing. See, a lot of leftists wear T-shirts celebrating old-timey terrorists like Assata Shakur, but then when they see some young, hardworking terrorist out there giving it his all, they balk. And you know what, Unity of Fields? You’re totally right. If you’re gonna call yourself a Jacobin, you best be ready to operate the guillotine. Me personally, as someone these people want to kill hypothetically and literally, I’m not saying I’m in favor. I’m just saying Unity of Fields has a point about T-shirts having real meaning.<br>In other news, a sometime Bloomberg reporter was arrested earlier this month for storming the Columbia University library as part of another anti-Zionist effort. The writer Salman Rushdie, who has the gall to not die yet, was set to give a graduation speech at Claremont McKenna but backed out amid protests and a selfish desire to keep his other eye. And a man walking around London is just casually tearing off mezuzahs with a pocketknife. That’s weird!<br>I guess I really converted to Judaism just in time for the fun stuff. I thought I was in for jelly doughnuts and lighting candles and funny dances. But I converted just as Warsaw was getting its ghetto, right when Iraqis started looking around and saying “Hey wait, Baghdad is 25 percent Jewish?” I have one tan on a Spanish beach, and boom, King Ferdinand gets an idea. It’s perfect timing.<br>→ We do not need an immigrant competition show: The Department of Homeland Security wants to develop a reality show titled The American, where immigrants compete through a variety of challenges “for the honor of fast-tracking their way to U.S. citizenship.” This is real. And the challenges will be incredible: finding the rotisserie chicken aisle at Costco; binge-watching Yellowstone without peeing the longest; seeing how fast you can get diabetes. DHS has been working with writer and producer Rob Worsoff (supervising producer of The Millionaire Matchmaker, co-exec producer of Duck Dynasty), who, in his 35-page show proposal, said that the show will aim to “celebrate what it means to be American and have a national conversation about what it means to be American, through the eyes of the people who want it most.” It’s a Hunger Games. It’s a Squid Game. But it’s real people, trying to escape gang wars and starvation. By singing a Luke Combs song in front of a studio audience and then doing an obstacle course after eating a Big Mac. I hate myself because I know I’ll watch this.<br>→ Trump-onomics: Trump might be our first true anti-capitalist president. As Walmart works to absorb the shock of the tariffs, which might be softened but are still a thing, Trumpo is slamming them for planning to raise prices. Even though that is quite literally exactly what tariffs are meant to do. Walmart sells lots of cheap goods made in China, and the tariffs are designed to make those goods more expensive. But as Trumpo puts it: “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!”<br>Speaking of economically strange decisions, the Senate unanimously passed the No Tax on Tips Act. A scheme that sounds emotionally right but is in practice bizarre. Anyway, unrelated, the new cost of a Free Press subscription is 30 cents - the $9.70 on top of that is simply a tip.<br>→ Budget cutting stumbles: Elon spent a huge amount of political capital trying to streamline the government. Now fully 71 percent of Dems literally want him in prison (maybe Alcatraz?), according to a Rasmussen poll this month, which does seem extreme. And despite it all, despite those press conferences with little X on his shoulders, despite even Big Balls, government spending is higher so far in 2025. And after Elon said last month he’d be stepping away from DOGE, he said this week he will be doing “a lot less” political spending. It’s the end of an era. The conservative activist Chris Rufo has a smart essay on why it failed.<br>Meanwhile, anti-Harvard funding cuts have been just enough to kill off a number of really good long-running studies that really have nothing to do with Hamas or DEI. There’s the study that began in 1989, investigating the causes of breast cancer; and another longitudinal study on diet and lifestyle factors affecting men’s health going back to 1986. Things such as that. You show ’em, 47!<br>And DOGE has had to scale back its initial efforts to cut costs and make the Social Security Administration more efficient. Why? Because Social Security is pretty efficient. So they’ve been cutting into bone. The Social Security website crashes almost every day now, and basic sad little office supplies like phone headsets are running out.<br>I had high hopes for DOGE and Elon, generally. As one of Elon’s wives, I’m always rooting for him. I look at my little R&amp;KLX’s barrel chest and think, a man with these genes can’t go wrong. Call me naive, but I figured that the guy who leads Tesla and SpaceX and Starlink could make a real dent in wasteful spending, but nary a dent could be made. The bureaucracy wins again. There was a lot of trolling though! That was fun, right guys? But yeah, there were no dents. Cutting government spending is never happening in our lifetime. We now know that it is literally easier to settle Mars.<br>→ Bring those old boys back: Trump officials who were too radical a few years ago are coming back with a bang.<br>For example, there’s John Gibbs. He’s leading policy development and research at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. His nomination for a different position failed during Trump’s first term, with senators questioning his promotion of various conspiracy theories - which senators ask about now but only to make sure you believe in them. He also once created a “think tank” called “the Society for the Critique of Feminism” (a club Bari wishes she founded while at Columbia), which argued that women should not be able to vote and blamed the “unequivocally bad” growth of the federal government on women’s suffrage. Now? Welcome, John. Vibes have shifted. When I look around the world at successful nations, it’s the ones where women can’t vote that are thriving. You might not like it, but Eritrea is what peak human performance looks like.<br>→ Japan is another universe: Japan’s agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after saying he “never had to buy rice” and that it was always gifted to him by supporters. Amid the country’s rice shortages and rising price of the grain, the comments felt poorly timed, and there was backlash. Welp, what more can be done? “I asked myself whether it is appropriate for me to stay... and I concluded that it was not,” he said, and he resigned. Just like that. <br>Imagine coming from a culture with this kind of honor code. This much self-respect. I barely understand what he did wrong. Our politicians get a 30-minute time-out for sexting the interns, and are promoted if they manage to successfully make a move. Senators get a stern no-no for doing a hit-and-run only if it kills someone and only if the body is found, otherwise a minor maiming or a disappeared wife goes without fanfare. If you send a bomb to the wrong country, you say whoopsies and just sit in a box for the next few basketball games instead of courtside. I’ll show up an hour late to a nice dinner, forget the host’s name, spill wine on the sofa, check the simmering soup and sneeze directly into it, and consider the evening a success. That’s America.<br>→ Keir’s still big mad about immigration: Keir Starmer, prime minister of the UK and the leader of the leftist Labour Party, continues his anti-immigration tirade this week. “If you work here illegally or employ people who do, we’re coming for you. Illegal working raids are up 40 percent. And we won’t stop there,” he posted on X. The British people are getting riled up! I had no idea they had this much pep left. The vim and vigor! But Keir, honey, have you seen London? Places like Stratford-upon-Avon produce one child per five Hugh Grants. Sweet Keir. It’s over. Grow a beard and call it a day.<br>More on the Democrats’ search for their Joe Rogan, the hackers overseeing FOIA requests, James Comey’s seashell spectacular, and more. But first: a cartoon from Mr. David Mamet:<br>→ We had Joe Rogan: At a town hall in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, earlier this month, Arizona senator Ruben Gallego said that while the left is preoccupied with needing to counter “the manosphere,” it isn’t acknowledging its own errors. “We had Joe Rogan. We canceled Joe Rogan years ago. Democrats don’t want to admit this. We did.” Truly, it is one of the great political fumbles. Rogan and also Musk, a literal green tech entrepreneur. And: RFK Jr. The left hates a winner. They hate to see a man with big biceps get too many followers. The Biden White House would do things like gather electric vehicle makers for a White House summit but not invite Musk, perhaps because Tesla’s not a union shop, and that’s his villain (Republican) origin story.<br>Now there’s an effort to find the next Rogan, with Democrat donors being asked to spend tens of millions of dollars to help do so. Because nothing says hip to the kids more than Democrat donors forming committees to find a podcaster who doesn’t offend anyone and anointing him king. I can’t wait to see who Alex Soros and Laurene Powell Jobs pick for us. A pump of Botox will be sprayed into the air, and we’ll know the Dems have found someone new. They’ll hold aloft a bag of oats. The new Joe Rogan.<br>→ Klarna Karma: Klarna, the “buy now, pay later” company that offers interest-free loans for retail purchases, saw its losses double this past quarter to $99 million, as consumers failed to repay their loans. What are Klarna loans for? Is this a new sort of mortgage? No. Klarna gives little microloans for Apple Watches and DoorDash lunches. So people can go into debt for their fancy sandwiches. They can default over Nikes. Know that when the debt collector knocks on my door because my teenage son didn’t pay his interest on a quesadilla loan, I will hand him over immediately.<br>→ FOIA has been run by actual hackers: A government contractor tasked with running software services to process government records employed two twin brothers, Suhaib and Muneeb Akhter, both of whom had previously been convicted of . . . hacking into the State Department. Yes, the hackers were then hired by a company overseeing sensitive government data, working there for about a year until a background check led to their termination. While they were still in the process of being fired, Muneeb reportedly deleted several government databases, including one that contained FOIA request data across multiple federal agencies.<br>Here’s my thing: Are twins ever even permissible this high up in government? No offense, but we all know who twins look out for, and it ain’t the security of their country. It’s their built-in best buddy. Genius twins who can do hacking are a national security threat and this one is on us.<br>The story comes from Bloomberg, which leaves us ominously with this: “More than an hour after being fired, Muneeb Akhter inserted a USB drive into his laptop and removed 1,805 files of data related to a ‘custom project’ for a government agency, the cybersecurity report said. (It’s unknown what the project entailed or what the files contained.)”<br>→ This is technically still illegal: Trump’s Department of Justice opened a civil rights investigation into Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, alleging he hired city employees solely because of their race, after the mayor gave a speech saying he hires solely based on race. Here’s Mayor Johnson: “Detractors... will push back on me and say, ‘The only thing the mayor talks about is the hiring of black people.’ No, what I’m saying is, when you hire our people, we always look out for everybody else. We are the most generous people on the planet. I don&#39;t know too many cultures that have play cousins. That’s how generous we are.” He then lists all the city leaders who are black and all the reasons the black race is superior for these roles. Anyway, typical MAGA craziness going after a normal American mayor who is simply doing diversity.<br>→ Oh, Comey: James Comey earlier this month posted a photo of seashells spelling out “86 47,” with the caption “cool shell formation on my beach walk.” People quickly interpreted his post as a thinly veiled threat against Trump. He later took the post down and clarified that he didn’t know “86’ing” referred to anything violent.<br>He later said that he and his wife stumbled on the shell formation, and debated its meaning: “I think it’s a clever political message. And she said, ‘You should take a picture of it.’ I said ‘sure.’ And then she said ‘You should Instagram that.’”<br>Wow. You would throw your wife under the bus just like that? Not very gallant-like, Mr. Comey. I used to be neutral-negative on Comey until I watched the Martha Stewart doc, which revealed to me that he led the prosecution (and persecution) of her for her non-crime. Since then I am a full-time anti-Comey activist. 86 7. No, that is not an opaque reference to Comey because he was the seventh FBI director. Why would you even think that? Also I only said that because Bari made me. And I’m sorry but a man posting political messages via seashells? In my America, we send you to jail for that.<br>→ Portland’s largest office tower goes to seed: Poor Portland. A beautiful, cool city that didn’t have any normie lame moderates to combat their communists. Now the premier office building in downtown Portland is for sale at 80 percent below its previous value. That tower, the U.S. Bancorp Tower, currently sits half empty. Homeless people took over the empty floors, “starting fires in stairwells, smoking fentanyl and defecating in common areas.” But really: They’re just doing the work of community. It’s just not in a way you’re used to - interrogate that.<br>Shockingly, there are no potential buyers. And while I’m sad to read something like that, you must understand that for others, this is great news. It’s nothing short of the fall of capitalism! May the Bancorp Tower decay! May all industry around you cease and may you return to subsistence farming. The fence we build around Portland is to keep them safe (from capitalism). Sure, you’re all professional tarot card readers right now, but I know you’ll be great at scrounging for little potatoes. I’m sure you can keep sheep alive long enough to make a thin woolen sweater.<br>But that’s just Portland. Stepping back into the capitalist scrum we all live in, the news is actually great. Violent crime is falling nationwide. We’re actually on track to have the least murderous year since the 1960s. In heavily Democratic Pittsburgh’s mayoral primary, a moderate Dem just defeated the incumbent progressive mayor. Which is a problem for me because I got out of visiting my in-laws for years by claiming I couldn’t go to “commie cities” and that we’d do the holidays via Zoom. Now what am I supposed to do? Show up to freezing Pittsburgh and sound shocked when a Weiss cousin tells me how Pittsburgh has more bridges than Venice even though someone has told me that five different times? Is it even true? Eat another slice of the “famous almond torte” and be all “Wow, that IS light!” I don’t deserve it.<br>→ I love Marie: Moderate Washington State Democrat and perfect 10 Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez announced that she would work with a House committee to develop brightness regulations for car headlights. Because on new cars, they’re just too bright! It’s blinding! Ow! It’s dangerous for us all. Or at least, all of us who spend time online discussing car safety standards and watt overreach. As she puts it: “If you spend any time on certain subreddits, some of which have thousands and thousands and thousands of subscribers, you will know about overly bright headlights.” My heart is skipping. I’m batting my eyes.

Just what we need, the Wuhan of space. Also: Leave it to China’s space station to be the one making new creations with unique abilities. The American space station bacteria is slow, lazy, and just sitting there with the Play-Doh. Sorry, I try not to write about my children here.<br>→ Why must you know whether we made Covid?

But I thought we’d moved on from calling the lab leak “a conspiracy.” So I’m honestly impressed that in the year 2025 they’re still going for this one. Our author adds that “so many eminent scientists still believe the theory is a dead end” and concludes that it’s good it was suppressed.

The Son Chases Crypto Deals.<br>While Steve Witkoff travels the world as Middle East envoy, his son Zach is pitching foreign deals for his cryptocurrency venture with the Trumps<br>Steve Witkoff and his son, crypto entrepreneur Zach Witkoff, at the Republican National Convention last July. HANNAH BEIER/BLOOMBERG NEWS<br>(By Rebecca Ballhaus and Angus Berwick - WSJ - May 22, 2025)<br>A month before President Trump’s inauguration, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff flew to the United Arab Emirates with two goals: discussing regional issues with the Abu Dhabi royal known as the “spy sheikh,” and attending a cryptocurrency conference. <br>Less than five months later, Witkoff’s son, co-founder of the crypto venture World Liberty Financial, took the stage at a conference in Dubai to announce the company had struck a deal for the sheikh’s company to buy $2 billion of their new cryptocurrency. The expected tens of millions of dollars in annual profits would be split between the Witkoffs and their co-founders - and the Trump family, which holds a 60% stake in the company.<br>On May 15, the elder Witkoff and the sheikh, Tahnoon bin Zayed al Nahyan, met again, this time for the unveiling of an agreement, long sought by the U.A.E., that gives the oil-rich Gulf monarchy access to millions of advanced U.S.-made computer chips. <br>Since assuming his role as special envoy, Witkoff, a 68-year-old longtime friend of Trump’s, has crisscrossed the globe on diplomatic business. At the same time, his 32-year-old son, Zach Witkoff, and a crew of advisers and associates have traveled to at least four countries as they pursue cryptocurrency deals that would make World Liberty an industry leader. <br>The parallel father-and-son dealings with the U.A.E. are a stark example of how World Liberty’s efforts have coincided with official government business.<br>In pitch calls with crypto companies, Zach Witkoff has described Trump as like a godfather and said that World Liberty would be well positioned to take advantage of the growing number of crypto regulatory changes in the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter. His postings on X regularly cite his father’s work for the White House. <br>The extraordinary blurring of government negotiations and private business dealings is rewriting the diplomatic playbook for some foreign countries looking to gain traction with the new Trump administration. The extent to which Trump associates, including the Witkoffs, have sought business since the inauguration in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere hasn’t been previously reported. <br>In addition to hiring U.S. lobbyists and sending delegations to Washington to improve ties with the Trump White House, some countries seeking to advance their causes have met with family members of U.S. officials and their friends, according to people familiar with the discussions and photos and videos of the meetings posted on social media. In one case, a veteran finance minister from Pakistan met with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s sister-in-law and the 19-year-old son of a close friend of Donald Trump Jr. to discuss digital assets. <br>Eric Trump, Zach Witkoff, and Justin Sun speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai.<br>World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff, center, with crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, left, and Trump Organization executive Eric Trump, right, at Token2049, a crypto conference in Dubai, on May 1. Photo: Anna Nielsen for WSJ<br>White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said that Steve Witkoff is divesting himself from his assets, including World Liberty, doesn’t have an “operational role” in the company and doesn’t discuss company or personal business matters in his government role. Trump, she said, is “incredibly proud of Steve and all that he has accomplished.” Witkoff, who isn’t taking a government salary and flies around the world on his personal jet, hasn’t released a public financial disclosure. He has said he would transfer his holdings to his sons.<br>World Liberty spokesman David Wachsman said the company’s business deals have nothing to do with the U.S. government, and that the company “wouldn’t even have the ability or insight to discuss official government business.” He said that “attempting to frame WLFI and Ambassador Witkoff taking meetings in the same country as some sort of conflict of interest” is incorrect, adding that “one has nothing to do with the other.” <br>He denied that Zach Witkoff had referred to Trump as like a godfather, noting that Witkoff is Jewish and doesn’t have godparents. <br>The Trump Organization, the Trump family real-estate company, has pledged not to make new deals with foreign governments while Trump is in office. World Liberty has made no such commitment. <br>Before he got into crypto, Zach Witkoff worked as a project manager at his father’s New York real-estate firm, the Witkoff Group. In 2020, he took over the family office, with “a focus on blockchain,” according to his LinkedIn profile. He, his father and others founded World Liberty in September, seven weeks before the presidential election.<br>World Liberty issues a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency called USD1, which it envisions as a tool for companies and individuals to shuttle funds across borders outside the banking system. The company has pitched its token to foreign governments that are eager to improve their relations with the U.S., people who have dealt with the company said. <br>In addition to World Liberty’s meetings with officials in the U.A.E., Zach Witkoff met in Pakistan with some of the same top government officials who weeks later negotiated with the Trump administration over a cease-fire with India. He told them World Liberty could use blockchain technology to “tokenize” buying and selling of the country’s rare-earth minerals. At the same time, Pakistan has been in talks to strike a rare-earth and other minerals deal with the U.S. potentially worth trillions of dollars, according to a lobbyist working with Pakistan on the deal.<br>The World Liberty spokesman said that the company’s meeting in Pakistan had “nothing whatsoever” to do with any deals the country may be negotiating with the Trump administration, and that its leaders haven’t discussed a minerals deal with anyone in either government. <br>Zach Witkoff’s advisers and associates also have met with Malaysia’s foreign minister and prime minister and Kyrgyzstan’s president, and have spoken virtually at a Moscow crypto conference that featured the Russian deputy finance minister.<br>Steve Witkoff and Tahnoon bin Zayed al Nahyan at a meeting in Abu Dhabi.<br>Steve Witkoff, second from left, met Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al Nahyan, second from right, in Abu Dhabi this month. The photo was posted to the sheikh’s Instagram account<br>Helping facilitate some introductions for World Liberty’s foreign travels is Changpeng Zhao, founder of the crypto exchange Binance, who in 2023 pleaded guilty, along with the company, to violating U.S. anti-money-laundering laws. Zhao has been seeking a pardon from the Trump administration, a return of his company to the U.S. market, and an end to the compliance requirements imposed after a settlement with the Justice Department. World Liberty’s spokesman said Zhao and Zach Witkoff are friends but that Zhao doesn’t act as a fixer.<br>A Binance spokesperson said Zhao has been driving “global innovation” in the crypto industry, and that the company “would be proud to help make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet.” <br>World Liberty, which doesn’t publicly disclose who buys its tokens, has raised more than $550 million from token sales this year. Among the buyers who have disclosed purchases: Abu Dhabi-based crypto trading firm DWF Labs, which bought $25 million worth, and Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, who invested $75 million and is now a company adviser. On Thursday evening, he was set to attend a crypto-related dinner with Trump as a VIP guest.<br>The World Liberty team has held talks about potential token purchases with other firms based in the Gulf, saying such deals could aid any U.S. expansion plans they have, people familiar with the talks said. The World Liberty spokesman disputed that the company said the deals could help any U.S. endeavors. <br>Since taking office, Trump has moved to roll back government oversight of the crypto industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission has paused or dismissed more than dozen cases against crypto companies, including a case against Sun, who is World Liberty’s largest known outside investor.<br>Business is booming for World Liberty. USD1, only a month or so after its launch, is already the world’s fifth-largest stablecoin, by market value, thanks to the U.A.E. deal. Binance on Thursday listed USD1 for trading on its platform, which is likely to boost demand for the token.<br>“Only the beginning,” Zach Witkoff posted on X in May.<br>Crypto connections<br>Weeks after Trump won the 2024 election, Steve Witkoff, an old friend of Trump’s from New York real-estate circles, made a swing through the Middle East. Trump had named him Middle East envoy shortly after his win, and Witkoff told Biden administration officials he wanted to start working on remaking his connections there, according to a person familiar with the matter.<br>President Trump shaking hands with Steve Witkoff in the Oval Office.<br>President Trump and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at the White House in May.

He and his brother, Alex, had already taken the reins of World Liberty.<br>Their father Steve - a crypto novice - was involved at the time in talks for a deal between Zhao’s crypto exchange Binance and representatives of the Trump family, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Witkoff denied involvement in the talks. Zhao also denied the talks.<br>As Trump’s inauguration approached, foreign countries began exploring new ways to build ties. During the first Trump administration, Pakistan had a rocky relationship with the U.S., which in 2018 suspended $300 million in military aid to the country. Trump repeatedly accused the country of not doing enough to tackle militant groups. <br>Hoping for a fresh start, in early January Pakistan hired a U.S. lobbyist to help arrange meetings in Washington around Trump’s inauguration, where the country’s interior minister made a plea for more U.S. investment.<br>In late January, Texas financier Gentry Beach, a close friend of Donald Trump Jr., led a delegation of investors to meet with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his cabinet, telling officials he wanted to invest billions of dollars in luxury real estate and Pakistan’s minerals sector, which is rich in rare-earth minerals such as lithium. Earlier that month, at an event at Mar-a-Lago, Beach had crowed about the access he was getting to government leaders abroad following Trump’s win. “They treat me like President Trump,” he said.<br>His son, Gentry Beach Jr., now 20, landed a meeting in Islamabad in February with Pakistan’s finance minister, Muhammad Aurangzeb, a former JPMorgan Chase executive, to discuss opportunities to develop the crypto sector there. The ministry viewed crypto as a way of drawing in wary foreign investors and reviving Pakistan’s moribund economy.<br>With Beach Jr. were two representatives of a sheikh from Dubai’s ruling family, a Russian tech executive and the co-founder of a crypto project called IslamicCoin. Beach said his son didn’t know the other people there, and never represented himself as part of anything related to the U.S. government.<br>Also in attendance was another American with a connection to the Trump administration: Keli Whitlock, the chief business officer of a U.S. blockchain firm. Whitlock’s sister is married to Hegseth, the U.S. defense secretary. Her company’s CEO attended, too. A month earlier, Whitlock had sat behind Hegseth, next to her sister, at his confirmation hearing.<br>Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the department “is not and has never been involved in business trips or meetings conducted by Secretary Hegseth’s sister-in-law in her capacity as a private citizen.”<br>Pakistani officials weren’t persuaded that Beach Jr. was the right person to help to make Pakistan a regional crypto leader, said one person familiar with the meeting. The finance minister ordered the creation of a National Crypto Council to oversee the drafting of crypto regulations in the hopes of attracting investors.<br>He appointed as its head Bilal bin Saqib, a Pakistani tech entrepreneur who had attended a Binance yacht party in Abu Dhabi last December and was at the U.A.E. crypto conference that Steve Witkoff attended.<br>From left: Pakistani tech entrepreneur Bilal bin Saqib, World Liberty co-founders Zak Folkman and Zach Witkoff, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, and Chase Herro, another World Liberty co-founder, in Abu Dhabi.

In late February, the administration exempted from its foreign-aid freeze $397 million in security assistance to Pakistan. Trump thanked Pakistan in his State of the Union address for its assistance apprehending a terrorist, delighting Pakistani officials.<br>In April, Pakistan signed a deal to pay $200,000 a month to a lawyer and two advisers close to Trump - his former bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and a former top Trump Organization lawyer, George Sorial - to help the country establish a “long-term economic partnership” with the U.S., specifically related to rare earth and critical minerals, according to foreign-lobbying records.<br>Around the same time, Binance’s Zhao traveled to Pakistan and was named a strategic adviser to the Pakistan Crypto Council. <br>About a week later, World Liberty named Saqib an adviser, citing, among other things, his experience working with governments.<br>The Pakistanis now had a Trump connection. <br>On April 26, a private jet carrying World Liberty’s leaders touched down in Islamabad. Zach Witkoff and co-founders Zak Folkman and Chase Herro, escorted by an armed bodyguard, were greeted on the tarmac by Saqib. In a later ceremony with Pakistan’s finance ministry, Witkoff signed a memorandum of understanding that the ministry said would allow World Liberty to help position Pakistan as a global crypto leader, and use its stablecoin for remittances and trade.<br>Later that day, the group flew to Lahore, where a police convoy escorted them to an evening celebration at a centuries-old citadel. Fireworks were set off in their honor, as Coldplay’s “Fix You” blared. In a recorded “fireside chat” in Lahore’s Shalimar Gardens, Witkoff said: “You guys are sitting on trillions of dollars of rare earth minerals.”<br>A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan said it is a Trump administration policy to support the growth of digital assets, calling it a “new area of diplomatic work” for the U.S. mission there. The Pakistan ministry of finance didn’t comment, and the embassy in the U.S. didn’t respond to requests for comment. <br>While the finance minister was meeting with World Liberty, he also was trying to set up a meeting with the Trump administration, lobbying records show. A U.S. lobbying firm Pakistan hired in April, for $25,000 a month, spoke to a Treasury Department official in early May about facilitating a call with the minister, the records show. <br>Robert Seiden, a lobbyist for Pakistan, said talks for a rare-earth minerals deal with the U.S. government have been moving swiftly. Under the new administration, Seiden said, countries “see that there is now a pathway forward if there’s a willingness to make a commercial deal” with the U.S. <br>Trump has continued to speak favorably about Pakistan, telling Fox News last week: “They’re brilliant people. They make incredible products.” <br>From Pakistan, Zach Witkoff traveled to Abu Dhabi for a private Binance summit, where he visited Zhao, then to the Token2049 conference in Dubai, where he and Eric Trump announced that a $2 billion investment into Binance by Sheikh Tahnoon’s company, MGX, would be paid in World Liberty’s USD1 stablecoin.<br>Zhao has continued to open doors for World Liberty. In May, he traveled to Kyrgyzstan, where he met with the president and formally joined the country’s National Crypto Council. He and a World Liberty adviser also met with the Malaysian government to discuss a “digital finance partnership” between the two countries on crypto regulations. <br>Some Democratic lawmakers are examining whether World Liberty’s interactions with foreign governments and foreign nationals violate the law.<br>Last week, Zach Witkoff posted on X a letter responding to Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), who had requested details on World Liberty’s finances, its communications with the Trump administration, including Steve Witkoff, and other policies. <br>The letter said World Liberty had exercised “rigorous diligence” to comply with the law. It didn’t include the requested records. <br>It was signed by Teresa Goody Guillén, a lawyer at BakerHostetler who is representing the firm. Since February, she also has been lobbying on behalf of Binance.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R208" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">209</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">HẠT NHÂN CỦA TỘI ÁC LÀ GÌ?<br>Xin đọc kỹ bài quan điểm của Ban Biên Tập WSJ về vụ sát hại hai người trẻ vào tối qua.

Photo: will oliver/epa-efe/shutterstock/Shutterstock<br>Since the Oct. 7 massacre, the chant has rung out on campuses and at protests: “Globalize the intifada.” Perhaps some people at those rallies didn’t know what the phrase meant, but the leaders must have. What happened late on Wednesday in Washington is a terrible warning.<br>At about 9 p.m. a gunman opened fire outside the Capital Jewish Museum as people exited an event for young Jews working in foreign policy. He murdered two: Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, employees of the Israeli embassy. Friends say Lischinsky had bought a ring and planned to propose to Milgrim next week in Jerusalem.<br>“Free Palestine. I did it for Gaza,” said the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, who pulled out a red kaffiyeh, according to a witness. We don’t know if he had identified his victims or would have shot at anyone leaving the Jewish museum.<br>As it happens, Lischinsky was an Israeli Christian who called Israel “the only place in the [Middle East] where Christians can thrive.” Milgrim, an American Jew, worked to build friendships between Israelis and Palestinians as a path to peace. The event they attended was a panel on multifaith humanitarian efforts to aid Gaza and other Arab war zones.<br>Many Americans don’t realize it, but Jewish schools, synagogues and the like in the U.S have long required serious security. It’s only getting worse. A study of 63 Orthodox Jewish schools found that the average security cost in 2022-23 was $184,000 a year. That has risen to $339,000 in 2024-25. Many Jewish events now keep their locations private.<br>A purported manifesto from the suspect recites the usual slanders about Israel, though new ones are popping up all the time. This week a United Nations humanitarian chief claimed 14,000 Gazan babies could starve to death in the next 48 hours. All now concede that’s bogus, but not before it went viral.<br>In 2017 the newspaper of the Party for Socialism and Liberation identified the suspected gunman as a member, though it now disavows him and says he’s been out of contact since. The PSL, a communist group with links to China, has been a major organizer of anti-Israel rallies, including one in Times Square on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with the Hamas death squads.<br>If that sounds far out, consider what the campus fixture Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) did on Oct. 8. “Today, we witness a historic win for the Palestinian resistance,” it told its chapters, and provided them materials for a “Day of Resistance” at colleges. A pamphlet depicted a Hamas paraglider alongside student protesters, all waging one struggle.<br>We don’t know to whom the shooter listened or whether he had a history of mental illness. But the rise of Soviet-style anti-Zionism, including enthusiasm for the total destruction of Israel and efforts to ostracize its domestic supporters, is corrosive to America and is stirring up old dangers for Jews. Americans of all faiths and political views have a share of the responsibility to push back.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R209" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">210</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">NẾP VĂN HÓA SÁT NHÂN ĐÃ LAN RA TOÀN CẦU<br>Hôm nay, sáng lập viên và chủ biên The Free Press là Bari Weiss có bài viết về vụ thảm sát hôm qua làm hai người trẻ thiệt mạng.

Yaron Lischinsky, 30, had purchased an engagement ring for Sarah Milgrim, 26, a few days ago. They were meant to fly to Israel this coming Sunday so that she could meet his parents before he proposed. (via @yaron_li/X)<br>By Bari Weiss - Thursday, 05.22.2025<br>Last night, outside of the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., a gunman opened fire and murdered two young people because he thought they were Jews and because they were gathered in a Jewish place for an event hosted by a Jewish organization. Before I tell you about their alleged killer and the culture of lies that created the climate for his murderous rampage, I want to tell you about the people he cut down. Because I promise you: There will be no campaigns or hashtags or celebrities’ videos urging all of us to say their names.<br>Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. Those are their names. They met at work - they were staffers at the Israeli embassy - and fell in love. Yaron, 30, had purchased an engagement ring for Sarah, 26, a few days ago. They were meant to fly to Israel this coming Sunday so that she could meet his parents, who live in Jerusalem, before he proposed.<br>Yaron was born in Israel to a Jewish father and a Christian mother. He was raised partly in Germany - he spoke German, Hebrew, and Japanese - and the mixed nature of his life embodied the very best of the West and the openness of our civilization. His friend Mariam Wahba, a Coptic Christian born in Egypt, said he was a “kind and generous friend, a devout Christian, and a defender of Israel. We would sit and debate early Christian theology for hours over a gin and tonic, and he would check in on me after every attack on Christians in Egypt.” (Read Mariam’s obituary of Yaron here.)<br>Sarah Milgrim was a Jew raised in Kansas who began working at the embassy in November 2023 - a month after the Hamas massacre of October 7, 2023. She had two master’s degrees - one in international studies from American University, and a second in natural resources and sustainable Development from the United Nations University for Peace. Sarah was an idealist: she volunteered with Tech2Peace, which supports entrepreneurship between young Palestinians and Israelis. When she was a high school senior, in 2017, some swastikas appeared on her public high school. “I worry about going to my synagogue, and now I have to worry about safety at my school,” she told the local TV station at the time. “And that shouldn’t be a thing.”<br>An embassy official cleans blood off the sidewalk at the shooting location outside the Capital Jewish Museum on May 22, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Tasos Katopodis via Getty Images)<br>That Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim happened to be at an event about delivering humanitarian relief across the region, including to Palestinians in Gaza, was of no concern to the alleged murderer. He was there to “free Palestine” - the slogan he shouted after he executed them. According to several witnesses, after the shooting, he reached into a bag, pulled out a keffiyeh and said: “I did this for Gaza.”<br>That may sound nonsensical to ordinary people. How would killing two Israeli embassy staffers improve the situation in Gaza? Of course one could ask the same question about the slaughter of some 1,200 men, women, and children by Hamas militants who invaded Israel on a Jewish holiday on October 7, 2023, and brought so much ruin on Gaza.<br>But the shooter’s evil worldview has a demented logic, and, as he proved, it’s a risk to us all. It’s a worldview that says that Jews and those who support the Jewish state - wherever they live - are now acceptable targets. It’s a worldview that insists that a beautiful young woman and man in love in our nation’s capitol might look like innocents to the uninitiated, when in fact they are monsters deserving of death. One of the things I found when looking for news about the murder of Lischinsky and Milgrim last night was a video from October 12, 2023, of a dozen or so masked people waving Palestinian flags in front of the museum. It’s strange to watch it now. A few people wearing masks and shouting slogans. Others beat drums. Some hold up signs. If anyone even noticed it among the chaos that began in this country on October 8, they probably dismissed it as a few kooks or ignored it entirely. As if it were ever normal to target a Jewish museum in order to protest a war in the Middle East against a terrorist group. As if it ever had anything at all to do with “Palestine.” <br>Then, over the weeks and months, the flags turned into chants to “globalize the intifada,” and professional talkers dismissed it as a metaphor and not what it always was: a demand for open season on Jewish people worldwide. The more elite the institutions, the more the people who populate them glorified evil. At George Washington University, students projected the words “Glory to our martyrs” and “Free Palestine from the River to the Sea” in giant letters on campus buildings. At Cooper Union in Manhattan, Jewish students had to hide in the library from a mob of their fellow students pounding on the door. At Harvard, more than 30 student groups signed a petition that found a way to blame Jewish victims for their own deaths - saying that they “​​hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” Students and faculty members at Harvard menacingly surrounded an Israeli student and intimidated him, and faced no meaningful repercussions.Posters of women and children being held hostage by barbarians were torn down by people with PhDs, many of them smiling as they did so.<br>At the same time, the online world of know-nothing influencers and podcasters coalesced to condemn Zionists, to brand the movement for Jewish sovereignty in the Jewish homeland - as the Soviets had tried to do in the ’70s - as a form of racism.<br>Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. (Handout via family)<br>And this week, the professional talkers repeated obvious lies, such as the idea that 14,000 babies could die within 48 hours in Gaza, a statement that was made and then walked back by the UN’s undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, Tom Fletcher.<br>Venomous, untrue statements about Israel, its supporters, and the war against Hamas in Gaza chipped away at the old taboo against open antisemitism in America. Constant demonization of American Jews and Zionists is how a democratic state and its supporters have been made into targets. It is how the “permission structure” for violence against Jews in America has been erected. <br>Growing up, learning about Simon of Trent or other medieval blood libels, I wondered how something so unnatural, so deranged, could ever happen. How lies could spread so far, transmogrify into a movement, infect culture so comprehensively, and engender deadly action. <br>Those who participate in this culture of lies and who now want to distance themselves from yesterday’s violence will insist that the alleged killer’s acts do not represent them. That it harms their movement. But how can anyone honest with themselves not draw a connection between a culture that says Zionists are antihumans - even Nazis themselves - and the terrorists now attacking Jews across the globe?<br>As this terrorist attack was being carried out in Washington, I was sitting in another Jewish museum - the Jewish Children’s Museum in Crown Heights - for an evening memorializing Ari Halberstam, a 16-year-old murdered in 1994 on the Brooklyn Bridge by an Islamist terrorist. The murderer later said that he did it for a singular reason: “I only shot them because they were Jewish.”<br>The alleged shooter in Washington last night may have shouted the words “Free Palestine,” but that is why he murdered Yaron and Sarah. Because he thought they were Jewish. <br>Among the many impressive people that spoke last night, one of them was Michael Mukasey, the former U.S. attorney general. Here is part of what he said: “It’s hard to believe that it has been 31 years since Ari Halberstam was murdered in an act of antisemitic terrorism - and it is indeed hard - it is harder still to believe that we are living in the midst of a widespread resurgence of antisemitism. Not only around the world, but also in our own country, where many of us - and I include myself - believed that although there might be occasional anitsemitic incidents, antisemitism would never become a widespread phenomenon. Oh boy, were we wrong.” <br>Sitting on the dais behind him was the top brass of the NYPD. Everyone who spoke, including me, thanked them for everything they are doing to keep Jews - to keep all of us - safe. But no police force, not even the best in the world, can hold back a culture that has embraced violence as a means of expression, that has lost hold of the difference between life and death.<br>Join us tomorrow at 1 p.m. EST for a Free Press livestream with historian Jeffrey Herf on the murders in D.C. - and the roots of the global intifada.

In other words, we have been here before (or technically, most of the time).<br>  I am not in any way, shape or form dismissing the $36T heap of debt we carry, equating to an uncomfortable level of interest expense at today’s rates.  We are now at 18% of tax revenue going to service this debt, which is historically quite high.  Whether it’s raising tax rates/revenue (i.e., Tariffs), decreasing spending (i.e., DOGE), or growing the tax base (i.e., a supply-side tax bill and deregulation), it remains a very steep uphill climb to find a politically viable long-term solution.  Still, the things I am not worried about at all are the US paying its bills, the demise of the American spirit to drive innovation and productivity, and the honor and respect we pay to our fallen heroes who made any of it possible.

You said it has more to do with global populist politics than anything else.  That populist politics exploit the hourly workers and contribute to the wage gap?~ Scott S.<br>&quot;My comment was about a widening wealth gap between those with assets that have benefited from rising prices to the majority of America with less.  Couple that with an erosion of purchasing power in the past several years, and there is a large part of the population feeling frustrated and left out.  The allure of populism is for the average Joe to push back against that establishment, hoping for a simpler path to solving those complicated and longer-term secular trends.  The populist and polarized political era of today is the result. ~ Brian T.

The couple was gunned down outside the Capital Jewish Museum. A suspect then walked into the building, accepted water from those who thought he was a victim, and began chanting “Free Palestine.” He pulled a red keffiyeh from his pocket and invoked the old rallying cry: “There is only one solution. Intifada revolution.”<br>The man now in custody, Elias Rodriguez, was once associated with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a hard-left political group whose slogans echo in anti-Israel demonstrations across the country. In the hours before the shooting, the group posted: “End the genocide. Israel out of Gaza now.” Rodriguez had marched in their protests and spoken at their rallies. After the shooting, they disowned him with haste, but the slogans remained. The worldview remained. The atmosphere remained.<br>This was not the act of a lone figure drifting through conspiracy. It was the collision of ideology and permission. Rodriguez did not invent the language that filled his mouth after the murders. It was given to him – polished in activist workshops, passed around on college campuses, reinforced by social media algorithms and institutional silence. That language gave him certainty. It gave him moral clarity. And then it likely gave him a target.<br>American antisemitism has changed. The old forms never disappeared, but something else has emerged beside them – something sharper, more socially acceptable, more dangerous for its capacity to hide in plain sight. What used to belong to the political fringes now thrives at the heart of self-declared “progressive” culture. The far left has absorbed the theological and conspiratorial architecture of Islamic antisemitism and fused it with a distinctly Western aesthetic: the language of equity, resistance, and liberation. It no longer marches under swastikas. It marches under PLO flags, wearing keffiyehs and holding aloft banners declaring human rights and signs soaked in blood-red metaphors of genocide and apartheid.<br>Whether knowingly or not, this ideology does not distinguish between Israelis and Jews, between diplomats and soldiers. It sees every Jew connected to Israel as part of a structure to be “dismantled.” Its fantasies are drawn in absolutes, its slogans lifted directly from the rhetoric of terror movements. In all the furious rhetoric, the old instincts are laid bare for all to see. New language, same old message – blame the Jew, dehumanize the Jew, remove the Jew.<br>Rodriguez’s path is not unfamiliar. He studied literature. He worked in nonprofits. He protested with Black Lives Matter in Chicago. He wrote about injustice and power and inequality. From the outside, he looked like many others shaped by America’s culture of activism. But at some point, the language he spoke turned sour. It began telling him that the world’s horrors trace back to a single enemy. That resistance meant confrontation. That confrontation meant violence. Too often this message has echoed on campuses, politely excused in the left wing media, and repeated so often it has infected the brains of a whole generation of angry young people.<br>So inspired by the Palestinian culture the left idolizes, the killer brought the cause’s most famous cultural contribution to the streets of the capital of the free world: terrorism and bloodshed. And to think, some people want to create a whole state based on this ideology, right next to the only Jewish one.<br>No one should be surprised that this logic has arrived at murder. The slogans repeated endlessly – “from the river to the sea,” “by any means necessary,” “global intifada”– are not metaphors. They are invitations. And for those inclined to listen closely, they are instructions. If you tell a generation that Israel is a colonial imposition, that Jews are white oppressors, that Gaza is Auschwitz and the IDF is the SS, do not pretend to be shocked when someone opens fire at a Jewish event in a US city.<br>The institutions that ought to be confronting this – universities, media, political parties – have too often made excuses for it. Jew-hatred, when dressed in anti-Zionist garb, is tolerated, platformed, even celebrated. The standards applied to other hatreds are quietly suspended. The same universities that launch full-scale investigations into pronoun disputes allow their lecture halls to echo with calls for Jewish extermination, so long as the speaker mentions the fantasy state of Palestine.<br>The Trump White House moved quickly to condemn the murders – and to its credit, has shown far greater clarity and resolve on antisemitism than its predecessor. But beyond the administration, too many powerful voices continue to enable the very atmosphere that made this shooting possible. Just days earlier, the United Nations amplified one of the most grotesque blood libels in recent memory, warning the world that 14,000 babies in Gaza were at imminent risk of dying from starvation within 48 hours. The figure was false, the timeline absurd, and the implication unmistakable: that Jews were mass murderers of infants. It was the kind of narrative that stirs primal hatred, and yet it was broadcast with the solemnity of moral concern. Even now, after two Jews were gunned down on the streets of Washington, the UN Secretary-General’s statement managed to condemn the murders as if they occurred in a vacuum, with no reference to the culture of demonization his own institution has helped promote. These are not minor missteps. They are the foundations of the worldview that brought Elias Rodriguez to a Jewish event with a gun. And unless they are dismantled, he will not be the last.<br>A young man had bought a ring and was planning to propose. A young woman was at his side. They walked out of a museum and were assassinated for being Israeli. Their deaths did not emerge from nowhere. They emerged from an ideological climate that is becoming more fevered, more violent, and more sanctioned.<br>There is still time to dismantle the structures that produce this violence. But only if we are honest about where they are, and who is building them. The line from campus chants to bullets outside a Jewish museum is not abstract, but direct. It will not be the last if it is not broken.<br>Jonathan Sacerdoti</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R212" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">213</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ĐẢNG CỘNG SẢN TRUNG HOA LŨNG ĐOẠN CANADA TỪ LÂU RỒI!<br>Độc quyền của The Bureau: tay chân của đảng Cộng sản Trung Hoa (CCP) lũng đoạn chính trường Canada đã lâu và thực tế chi phối đảng Tự Do của đương kim Thủ tướng Mark Carney từ thời Thủ tướng Justin Trudeau!<br>https://www.thebureau.news/.../exclusive-ccp-tied-group...<br>Exclusive: CCP-Tied Group That Met Carney Joined 2019 United Front Gala at Wei Wei Mansion With Liberal Insiders—Months Before Casino Raid<br>(By Sam Cooper - The Bureau - May 22, 2025)<br>∙ Paid<br>TORONTO — New evidence reviewed by The Bureau reveals that the Jiangsu Commerce Council of Canada - the Chinese Communist Party-linked business group at the center of a controversial meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney during his leadership campaign - was among the key attendees of a lavish Lunar New Year gala in January 2019, attended by senior Liberal Party organizers and hosted by Wei Wei, a United Front affiliate and Chinese organized crime target, at one of Wei’s Toronto-area mansions.<br>A year later, another of Wei’s residences would become the focus of a high-level York Regional Police and CSIS investigation into underground casinos, weapons stockpiles, and transnational money laundering that police allege abetted international drug trafficking.<br>Evidence suggests Wei Wei’s properties were used for political donations to the Don Valley North Liberal Association, a campaign in Markham–Thornhill, and a Liberal nomination contestant in the Markham–Unionville riding.<br>One photo from the January 2019 gala at a Wei Wei mansion shows the host standing with three Jiangsu Commerce Council leaders, including a Liberal Party riding association boss for the Markham area. Another image from the event shows the same leaders alongside lawyer Bang-Gu Jiang - a former York Regional Police board member who contested the Liberal Party nomination for Don Valley North in 2019.<br>Elections Canada records show that both Wei Wei and the JCCC’s former president donated to Bang-Gu Jiang’s nomination effort in Markham–Unionville during Justin Trudeau’s tenure as Liberal leader.<br>The revelation deepens the controversy surrounding JCCC’s political access and linkages to figures investigated by Canadian police. During his campaign to become Prime Minister, Mark Carney denied meeting with JCCC leaders with links to Beijing’s United Front Work Department, after The Globe and Mail reported on the meeting.<br>The JCCC’s website was subsequently pulled offline. However, The Bureau published photographic and documentary evidence showing Carney did in fact attend a JCCC-sponsored event in Toronto - a high-level Chinese New Year reception involving key figures in the Liberal fundraising ecosystem. Among them were JCCC executives linked to a United Front PPE operation involving the same Markham riding boss photographed with Wei Wei at the January 2019 gathering at Wei’s lavish residence.<br>This Liberal Party official - listed as a director alongside Wei Wei of the Canada Hefei Friendship Association, which nominally hosted the January 2019 gala at Wei’s Toronto mansion - has long held fundraising and organizing roles for Liberal candidates across the Greater Toronto Area.<br>The newly surfaced 2019 gala - hosted on January 5, months ahead of the federal election - was held at one of Wei Wei&#39;s upscale Toronto-area homes and attended by over 40 community association leaders, business executives, and political operatives. While separate from his notorious 5 DeCourcy Court property, which was raided in a sweeping police operation, the interior photos confirm a similarly extravagant setting: crystal chandeliers, silk table settings, a decadent bar populated by dozens of wine and high-end Chinese liquor bottles, and banners for the Hefei Friendship Association (HFA).<br>Photographic and documentary evidence obtained by The Bureau confirms that among the attendees were Wei Wei, casually dressed and seated beneath red velvet lounge décor; the president of the Canada Hefei Friendship Association, who opened the gala with a speech promoting political and economic exchange with Anhui Province; Bang-Gu Jiang, a Liberal nomination contender in Don Valley North; and the Liberal riding boss tied to the JCCC, who played a central role in the party’s regional fundraising apparatus.<br>The gala also brought together leaders from the Confederation of Toronto Chinese Canadian Organizations (CTCCO), a group founded in 1985 and described in The Globe and Mail as linked to Peter Yuen, Carney’s chosen candidate to replace MP Paul Chiang in Markham–Unionville. According to The Globe, CTCCO is led by an individual who “has close ties to the Chinese consulate and attended sessions of the Chinese People’s Congress and Chinese People’s Consultative Conference, a top advisory body to President Xi Jinping.” That individual, along with the CTCCO, was debanked by TD Bank, which cited internal documents showing the organization’s transactions were flagged as involving “individuals or entity(ies) identified by media, law enforcement and/or intelligence agencies as being linked to criminal activities,” The Globe reported.<br>Yuen, a former Toronto Police deputy chief, ultimately failed to win the Markham riding after replacing MP Paul Chiang, a former York Region police officer who had resigned amid controversy for suggesting that Conservative candidate Joe Tay should be handed over to Chinese consular authorities in Toronto.<br>Bang-Gu Jiang, who unsuccessfully sought Liberal Party nominations under Justin Trudeau’s leadership, served on the York Regional Police Services Board from 2013 to 2018 as a provincial appointee. During her tenure, she played a direct role in governance, overseeing senior police executive appointments, operational budgeting, business planning, and the development of policing policies.<br>In 2014, Wei Wei donated $1,200 to Bang-Gu Jiang’s Liberal Party nomination campaign in Markham–Unionville. Another $1,200 came from Rui Jiang, a co-director of the Jiangsu Commerce Council of Canada, who has reportedly attended United Front-linked events with senior PRC officials - including Xi Jinping - and was pictured beside Mark Carney during the group’s 2025 New Year gala.<br>According to an intelligence source cited in The Bureau&#39;s earlier investigation into Wei Wei’s 5 DeCourcy mansion, a CSIS-linked warrant targeting United Front influence operations explicitly referenced Wei’s role with the Hefei Friendship Association.<br>Mandarin-language researchers assisting The Bureau’s investigation also discovered that a name matching Wei appears as a member of the Western Returned Scholars Association of Anhui in June 2018, and that this association is listed by the Anhui Province CCP United Front Work Department.<br>One Chinese-language report described the 2019 event at Wei Wei’s home, with guests enjoying homemade Anhui cuisine prepared in the host’s marble-appointed, high-end kitchen, a Brazilian dance performance by bikini-clad Latina dancers, and full bar service beneath a multi-tiered chandelier.<br>A separate report from JCCC described the event with similar details. An archived version - since pulled offline - praised the Canada Hefei Friendship Association’s ambition to position Toronto as a hub for Chinese diaspora cooperation - language that closely mirrors standard messaging associated with the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front Work Department. The report states that the Hefei group is controlled by the People&#39;s Consultative Conference of Hefei.<br>A message from JCCC posted to another event report - in language suggesting a tone of seniority - praised the HFA for its &quot;great progress,&quot; with sentences suggesting ideological alignment between the two organizations.<br>An additional source still online lists an astonishing number of associations attending the event, including the Yunnan, Ningxia, Hainan, Zhejiang, Quanzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, Fujian, Henan, Sichuan, and Jilin chambers of commerce, as well as the Canada-China Real Estate Investment Chamber.<br>The opulence of the setting - gold-trimmed chairs, marble bars, name-tagged Liberal Party members sipping cocktails under red-and-gold balloons - mirrored the fusion of wealth, politics, and foreign power projection. And it places at the center of that operation Wei Wei, a man who would soon become the subject of a national security and organized crime investigation involving York Regional Police, CSIS, and RCMP federal serious organized crime teams.<br>Project Endgame, a major York Regional Police operation, eventually targeted Wei’s mansion at 5 DeCourcy Court, which police allege had been transformed into an underground casino stocked with weapons, alcohol, and surveillance equipment. Officers seized more than $1 million in cash, $1.5 million in alcohol, 11 firearms, and arrested over 30 suspects on gambling, firearms, and money laundering charges. According to York Deputy Chief Brian Bigras, the casino profits were suspected to be funneled into broader criminal networks, including drug trafficking and prostitution. York police characterized the operation as demonstrating “opulence and audacity,” and CSIS joined the investigation amid concerns that compromising footage of political figures at the mansion could be used for blackmail or foreign interference.<br>Wei had multiple properties raided in 2020. On July 30, York Regional Police raided the 761 Woodland Acres residence in Vaughan, where they arrested Wei Wei, his wife Xiang Yue Chen, and daughter Chen Wei. Police also seized 51,000 Canadian dollars and 19,000 U.S. dollars in gambling cash at that location. According to Elections Canada, from this same address, Wei Wei’s wife donated $895 to the Don Valley Liberal Association.<br>While many charges were laid in Project Endgame, most charges against Wei Wei were later dropped after a high-end watch seized during the raid mysteriously disappeared while in police custody.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R213" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">214</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">OVER MY SHOULDER by MAULDIN ECONOMICS:<br>Hôm nay, tiết mục Over my Shoulder của Mauldin Economics giới thiệu quan điểm của giáo sư kinh tế Don Boudreaux: nói khu vực chế biến của Hoa Kỳ sa sút (như lý cớ gây thương chiến) là không đúng với thực tế.<br>Tôi thì nôm na cho là Trump nhìn vào kính chiếu hậu mà lao xe xuống vực - rồi vỗ ngực tự khen!<br>https://www.mauldineconomics.com/.../don-boudreaux...<br>Newsletter - May 22, 2025<br>Don Boudreaux: American Manufacturing is Doing Just Fine<br>Patrick Watson, Editor<br>Why You Should Read: Libertarian economist Don Boudreaux highlights some data many people seem to have missed.

But American manufacturing, in fact, is <br>thriving. In the twenty years from the first quarter of 2005 through the fourth quarter of 2024, real manufacturing output for the U.S. as a whole rose by 30 percent. <br>The St. Louis Fed has quarterly data on real manufacturing output also by state. Even in the rust belt, manufacturing output has increased over these twenty years. The inflation-adjusted aggregate manufacturing output of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin is today (the fourth quarter of 2024) 14 percent higher than it was in the first quarter of 2005. <br>Manufacturing is doing even better in the south. In the past twenty <br>years, the inflation-adjusted aggregate manufacturing output of <br>Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia has risen by 25 percent. <br>And in the west it’s going gangbusters. In Arizona manufacturing output is up by 114 percent, in California by 78 percent, in Oregon by 70 percent, and in Colorado by 39 percent. <br>The narrative – peddled today by pols and pundits across the political spectrum – that trade has “hollowed out” American manufacturing is the opposite of the truth. <br>Sincerely, <br>Donald J.

Not just Treasuries, but stocks, too, tumbled as investor concern over the US fiscal profile deepened.<br>The moves were reminiscent of Trump’s wrangle with the bond markets last month, when he blinked. In the early morning hours of April 9, Treasury yields surged as Trump’s steep retaliatory tariffs - the highest in more than a century - went into effect. While a months-long slump in equities barely fazed him, the bond market got his attention.<br>“The bond market is very tricky,” he said at the time, announcing that he was suspending most of the tariffs just hours after they went into effect. “But yeah, I saw it last night where people were getting a little queasy.”<br>If Treasuries continue to stay queasy, the higher yields not only threaten to dampen economic growth - as they translate into higher borrowing costs for everything from homes to cars - but to accelerate the government’s fiscal deterioration. As rates rise, so does the Treasury’s interest bill.<br>Read more: US Interest Burden Hits 28-Year High, Escalating Political Risk<br>“Investors are now asking themselves a very difficult question, which is, would you loan the US government money at 5% for 30 years?” said George Catrambone, head of fixed income and trading at DWS Americas. “That’s the question that we have and are facing the long end of the Treasury market.”<br>Unlike in April, Trump has not had Bessent - who has been speaking to investors in Saudi Arabia and meeting with Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Canada - hovering over his shoulder as he negotiated the House’s tax bill in the Oval Office. It was Bessent, a hedge fund veteran, who helped persuade Trump to pause the tariffs when bond markets sent distress signals.<br>Bessent last month played down the selloff in Treasuries as a function of deleveraging by some market participants.

Set at $10,000 in Trump’s 2017 tax law, Republicans from high-tax states like New York and California negotiated an increase to $40,000 as the price of their votes for the package.<br>But it was a 12-basis-point increase in 30-year Treasury yields Wednesday that seems to have provided the impetus for further spending cuts to make the bill palatable to Republican hard-liners.<br>“The bond market seems to have spoken,” said Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio, one of two Republicans to vote ‘no’ on the bill.<br>Tush Push<br>As the bond markets started to show unease this week, Trump redoubled his efforts to get the measure - formally named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act - passed in the House. He visited Capitol Hill, called lawmakers and invited holdouts to the White House.<br>With the Memorial Day holiday weekend coming up, Republicans felt an urgency to get a legislative win in a presidency characterized by a blizzard of executive orders.<br>“The bill has to be done as early as possible both because the American people deserve the money in their pockets and the changes in their lives, but it also needs to happen soon, so it can have the biggest impact,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a close Trump ally. “If we are in the middle of a Trump economic boom in 2026, we will keep the House.”<br>If Republicans fail to pass the tax package, just as tariffs create a drag on the economy, then voters could revolt in the midterms. “In 2026, the only question that will matter is: Is it working?” Gingrich added.<br>But there’s no guarantee that the uneasy truce among the party’s various factions will remain intact when the bill gets to the other side of the Capitol.<br>Senate Majority Leader John Thune - who will lead the effort to shepherd the bill through his chamber starting in June - called the ratings agency downgrades “a warning shot that we need to get serious about spending restraint.” He said this week that any final bill would need to make a meaningful dent in spending, but also boost faster economic growth.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R215" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">216</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỘT DÂN BIỂU DÂN CHỦ TỐ GIÁC SỰ GIAN TRÁ!<br>Dân biểu Dean Phillips tại Minnesota nhiều lần trực tiếp chứng kiến tình trạng sức khỏe suy sụp của Tổng thống Joe Biden nên kín đáo nêu vấn đề trong đảng từ giữa năm 2022.

Will They Listen Now?<br>“Constant lying and gaslighting the public about Biden’s health has cost the Democratic Party the public’s trust,” writes Dean Phillips. (Shawn Thew-Pool/Getty Images)<br>If a relatively little-known congressman like me knew that Biden was incapable of leading the country in a second term, what does that say about the complicity of the real party bosses?<br>(By Dean Phillips - The Free Press - 05.22.25 - U.S. Politics)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>This week, journalists Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper released a bombshell book detailing even greater depths of the cover-up of former president Joe Biden’s declining health. Also this week: Biden’s spokesperson decided to announce that the former president has stage 4 prostate cancer.<br>Coincidence? I think not.<br>Numerous doctors have pointed out how unlikely it is that Biden was just diagnosed with this cancer. Biden himself even slipped up and said he had cancer in 2022. Common sense tells us that the most powerful man in the world, with access to the best healthcare in the world, would have surely known.<br>As the father of a cancer survivor, I know firsthand how painful these diagnoses are for patients and their families. But as a former Democratic congressman from Minnesota who, for years, has demanded greater transparency and accountability from my party, I am outraged to see that the important lessons from the top scandal of the 2024 election have still not been learned.<br>Constant lying and gaslighting the public about Biden’s health has cost the Democratic Party the public’s trust. Rebuilding it first requires the courage and honesty to admit to what happened.<br>In 2021, I had a front-row seat on two occasions when he addressed the House Democratic Caucus. I also spent time in close proximity to the president during two flights on Air Force One, in 2021 and 2022, where I was alarmed to see the president’s obvious decline in communication skills, gait, and leadership capacity. After the White House holiday party in December 2022, at which the president’s decline was too graphic to ignore, I was left with no doubt in my mind - Biden was unfit to serve a second term.<br>My opinion wasn’t an outlier. My congressional colleagues, like me, had eyes; behind closed doors we acknowledged the reality, lamented our party leadership’s inaction, and recognized the impending disaster awaiting us in November 2024.<br>After many of the same hushed conversations, I tried to impress a sense of urgency. I made calls to potential presidential candidates, like Illinois governor JB Pritzker and Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, to urge them to run. But they didn’t even want their names mentioned - let alone return my calls.<br>Frustrated, I went public, calling for an open primary. I implored prominent Democrats like California governor Gavin Newsom, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Vice President Kamala Harris to throw their hats in the ring. But cometh the moment - cameth nobody.<br>By the fall of 2023, I realized not only that Biden was in serious decline, but that the polling was clearly showing he couldn’t win. My party was sleepwalking into a second Trump term. So, with no one else willing to step forward - I entered the race.<br>No one puts themselves forward for president if they don’t believe they’re prepared and would do a good job - and I was no exception. But I knew I had a longer-than-long shot. More realistically, I was trying to spark a competitive primary - and at the very least to force a single, televised debate for Americans to assess the president and other candidates firsthand. I simply wanted Americans to see up close what I had seen and what the White House was trying to hide from them, and before it was too late.<br>Immediately before entering the race, I made courtesy calls to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and President Biden - but his chief of staff, Jeff Zients, took the call and made it clear I would not be speaking to Biden or anyone else in the White House.<br>I announced that I was running for president on October 27, 2023. Almost immediately, the party mechanism was activated, and I became persona non grata. The media, in particular MSNBC, where former Biden staffers wielded positions of influence—essentially deplatformed me and those supporting me. Party activists, paid and volunteer, took to social media to attack and discredit me.<br>The Democratic National Committee announced proactively that there would be no debates. State Democratic parties took steps to keep anyone not named “Biden” from being on the ballot, forcing us to file several lawsuits. In Florida, state Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried moved immediately to prevent my name from appearing on the primary ballot - literally disenfranchising millions of Florida voters by denying them the opportunity to even participate in a primary.<br>This wasn’t a fight for democracy, rather a coordinated fight against democracy - executed by a private corporation with no accountability to voters.<br>For a party ostensibly focused on protecting democracy and expanding voter rights and access, denying Democratic primary voters a single alternative to Biden was nothing short of rank hypocrisy.<br>It was one thing for my fellow Democrats to stay silent, to avoid rocking the boat. But some even subjected me to vicious, underhanded attacks. Representatives Steven Horsford and Jim Clyburn even made veiled insinuations of racism when I focused my early efforts in New Hampshire - suggesting my run was somehow an affront to black Americans.<br>Ironically, their tactics and those who chose cowardice over courage and self-preservation over principle resulted in an affront to ALL Americans.<br>It has always been my contention that Biden wasn’t behind any of these decisions. And therein lies the problem; he was surrounded by advisers and a family falsely assuring him he was popular, able, and the best candidate to take on Donald Trump.<br>And where did it get us? All those months of carefully guarding the president, prewriting his speeches, prerecording his interviews? In the end, the only unscripted, significant event President Biden did during his campaign was the July 2024 debate that was an unmitigated disaster. His entire campaign crumbled in the most humiliating way possible.<br>It’s astonishing that, for so long, Americans have both enabled and tolerated a virtual monopoly on our democracy by two private corporations: the Democratic and Republican parties. In the United States, we should never tolerate monopolies, or in this case duopolies, in any category, never mind the most important one - our democracy.<br>In real terms, reform means breaking down barriers to access ballots and the electoral system; fostering and inspiring competent, common sense candidates; and encouraging the rise of at least one compelling third party that offers competitive candidates.<br>For too many Americans, the Democratic brand is now associated with rising costs, inefficiency, tenure over talent, bureaucratic complexity, poor customer service, and the “canceling” of people and ideas that diverge from the Democratic gospel.<br>          There must be an almost obsessive focus on real-world outcomes: lowering healthcare costs, expanding housing, improving public safety and public education, and managing cities, states, and our country in a fiscally responsible manner.<br>The Democratic Party can still redeem itself. But the first step is for everyone that was aware of Biden’s condition to come clean. No more evasions. No more insistence that he was sharp when you met him. The whole truth will come out, and they would be wise to get ahead of it. If a relatively little-known congressman like me knew that Biden was incapable of leading the country in a second term, what does that say about the complicity of the real party bosses whose names we all know?<br>American voters of all political perspectives are tired of being ignored, talked down to, lied to, canceled, and expected to choose between competing versions of increasingly similar political dysfunction. For Democrats, this is an existential moment. It’s time to acknowledge their misdeeds and move on.<br>Thomas Jefferson wrote, “Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.” Indeed, trust begins with telling the truth. Not a modified truth. Not a truth that polls say people want to hear. The full truth, and nothing but the truth.<br>Protecting a president or institution at the cost of its credibility is a shortsighted and losing proposition. Democratic leaders and messengers must understand that sunlight is not our enemy, but rather the only way to earn the public’s confidence in our party.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R216" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">217</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TRUYỀN THÔNG QUỐC DOANH VÀ QUỐC TRƯỞNG BỆNH HOẠN<br>Nền dân chủ Hoa Kỳ đang hồn nhiên lao dốc: Trong khi Hạ Viện Cộng Hòa vừa biểu quyết xong dự luật ngân sách với đa số chỉ có một phiếu thì truyền thông báo chí của đảng Dân Chủ xếp hàng bày tỏ nỗi kinh ngạc về bệnh tình của Tổng thống Joe Biden, khi đó vẫn được họ đồng ca là rất tốt đẹp. <br>Giáo sư Jonathan Turley trình bày hiện tượng ‘gia nô’ của truyền thông khi toa rập cùng chế độ Biden và đảng Dân Chủ để tìm nhiều cách che giấu sự thật trong cả năm trời:<br>https://jonathanturley.org/.../implausible-deniability.../<br>Implausible Deniability: Media Figures Continue to Spin the Coverup of Biden’s Decline Despite Crushing Polls<br>(Jonathan Turley - Uncategorized - May 22, 2025) <br>From Jake Tapper to Chuck Todd, the media in Washington has become a chorus of Claude Rains expressing how “shocked, shocked” they are about the mental diminishment of former President Joe Biden. These are some of the same journalists who attacked those who raised the issue for years. Now, polls are showing that the public is not buying the deflection. Sixty-three percent of those surveyed in the most recent poll say it is “likely” that “major media journalists were aware of Joe Biden’s declining mental condition, but covered it up.” The evidence is mounting of a coordinated campaign to conceal Biden’s demonstrable incapacity from White House staff to doctors to the media.<br>Reporters like Fox’s Peter Doocy were openly mocked by some of the same White House press corps members now expressing outrage over the cover-up. This morning Doocy recounted how he was virtually heckled in the press room when he raised questions of Biden’s diminishment.<br>Now, these reporters are insisting that they had no inkling it was this bad. No one is buying it, but it does not appear to matter.<br>Given the stories on Fox and a few outlets on the cover-up for years, it is insulting to tell the public that the degree of decline was kept from them. It is akin to describing rioting as “fiery but mostly peaceful.” The public could see the decline with their own eyes on the media outlets willing to cover the story.<br>In the meantime, the scope of the cover-up is coming to light. This week, it was disclosed that the White House devised an alternative to making Biden available to the press given his cognitive decline. They faked a town hall to take clips for the campaign to create the false image of Biden interacting with questions. The problem was that Biden could not stay focused and cogent for five minutes.<br>The footage was described as “unusable.”<br>So, in addition to hiding the President’s decline, White House and campaign officials tried to create a false image of Biden as being able to engage in the simplest interactions. One source said “the man could not speak” and showed an “inability to find words, to remember what he was saying, to stay on one train of thought. Aides would sometimes make the videos in slow motion to blur the reality of how slowly he actually walked … If he was off, editing footage in a way that cast him in the best light would require hours of work.”<br>So the same media that helped in this cover-up and attacked those pursuing the story will continue to report while claiming shock at the story.<br>“Let’s Go Brandon!” became a familiar political battle cry not just against former President Joe Biden but also against the mainstream media. It was first heard during an Oct. 2021 interview with race-car driver Brandon Brown after winning his first NASCAR Xfinity Series race. When NBC reporter Kelli Stavast’s questions were drowned out by loud and clear chants of “F— Joe Biden,” the reporter quickly and inexplicably declared, “You can hear the chants from the crowd, ‘Let’s go, Brandon!’”<br>“Let’s Go Brandon!” instantly became a type of “Yankee Doodling” of the political and media establishment.<br>The public’s response has been deafening. Readers and viewers have left mainstream media in a mass exodus. Despite falling revenues and ratings, most media outlets seem entirely clueless or, at least, unyielding. Even as media outlets plummet in revenue, editors and reporters continue to saw at the branch upon which they are sitting.<br>When Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos brought in Robert Lewis, a British media executive, to try to restore profitability and readership to the paper, he was met with a virtual mutiny. Lewis nevertheless dropped this truth bomb in the middle of the newsroom: “We are going to turn this thing around, but let’s not sugarcoat it. It needs turning around. We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff. Right. I can’t sugarcoat it anymore.”<br>The media continues to interview and write for itself. Tapper is being interviewed by the same media that joined him in actively suppressing the story.<br>Call it implausible deniability. It is enough to allow the media to continue to feign independence and objectivity. Everyone can return to the same inbred media circles and cocktail parties while blaming the White House for their lack of investigation. It is just a shrug and a spin from journalists who acted like a de facto state media.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R217" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">218</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">THÊM MỘT LỜI KHUYÊN CHO DONALD TRUMP!<br>Trên mạng Gatestone Institute, Bassam Tawil lại phải nhắc lại, rằng Iran và tay sai là lực lượng khủng bố Hamas muốn gì, để Donald Trump đừng tưởng bở và cho là mình sẽ tạo ra phép lạ! <br>https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/.../hamas-wants-to...<br>Do Not Be Fooled by Iran: What They Really Want Is to Destroy America, Israel Is Just in the Way<br>(by Bassam Tawil - Gatestone Institute - May 22, 2025 at 5:00 am)<br>*    The real nakba [catastrophe, for Palestinians] was that they started a war and lost it.

Pictured: Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (R) meets with the late Ismail Haniyeh (C), then head of the political bureau of Hamas, and Ziyad al-Nakhalah, Secretary General of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, on July 30, 2024. (Photo by the Iranian Supreme Leader&#39;s Press Office via Getty Images)<br>In many respects, Hamas, the Iran-backed terror group, has always been more forthright and honest about its goals regarding Israel than its rivals in the Palestinian Authority (PA). When one listens to leaders of the PA and the leaders of Hamas in Arabic, it is almost impossible to tell the difference between them. Their rhetoric, for instance, to vilify Israel, is identical: &quot;The Zionist Enemy&quot;, &quot;the Zionist Entity&quot;, the State of Occupation&quot;, and &quot;the Apartheid State&quot;.<br>Hamas and the PA both view the establishment of Israel as a &quot;catastrophe&quot; (nakba) and call for flooding it with millions of Palestinian &quot;refugees&quot; so that Jews become a minority to eliminate or cast out.<br>Hamas makes clear to everyone that its primary goal is to wage jihad (holy war) against Israel with the intention of replacing it with an Islamist state. The terror group&#39;s covenant proudly quotes Hassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood organization, as stating: &quot;Israel will exist and continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.&quot;<br>In mid-May, the PA and Hamas marked the 77th anniversary of &quot;Nakba Day&quot; (&quot;Catastrophe Day&quot;), a reference to the establishment of Israel in 1948.<br>Hamas, in a statement, said:<br>    &quot;The occupation [Israel] has no legitimacy or sovereignty over any part of our occupied land, and our people will continue to themselves through comprehensive resistance until the liberation of all of Palestine.&quot;<br>The terror group vowed that the &quot;resistance&quot; against Israel will continue until Palestinian refugees achieve the &quot;right of return&quot; to their former homes inside Israel.<br>Most of the so-called refugees are not real refugees. Most are descendants - now quite distant - of refugees who lost their homes when five Arab armies attacked Israel in 1948 in an attempt to prevent it from coming into existence. For Hamas and other Palestinians and Arabs, the fact that they failed to thwart the establishment of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people is a &quot;catastrophe.&quot;<br>The real nakba was that they started a war and lost it. Well, if you start a war, that is what can happen.<br>The PA and its president, Mahmoud Abbas, share Hamas&#39;s view. In a speech marking &quot;Nakba Day,&quot; Abbas, bizarrely referred to by some Westerners as a &quot;moderate leader&quot; even though he handsomely pays his people to murder Jews, described the establishment of Israel as a &quot;tragedy&quot; and as &quot;the catastrophe of catastrophes.&quot;<br>Like Hamas, Abbas called for flooding Israel with millions of Palestinian &quot;refugees&quot;:<br>    &quot;On behalf of the steadfast Palestinian people, and in the name of more than 15 million Palestinians, including seven million Palestinian refugees, we renew our pledge that we will remain adherent to our rights and will continue our legitimate struggle for freedom and independence until they are realized. Today, we commemorate not only this somber anniversary, but renew the pledge that the Nakba was not and will not be the permanent and inevitable fate of our people, and that the right of return, the right to self-determination, and the independence of the Palestinian State are steady and inalienable rights and will not be forsaken by our people.&quot;<br>Such statements by Hamas and Abbas show why the talk about a peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is, unfortunately, just a sick joke. If the Palestinians consider the establishment and existence of Israel a &quot;catastrophe&quot; and &quot;tragedy,&quot; this means that they have not – and will not – recognize Israel&#39;s right to exist.<br>By demanding the &quot;right of return&quot; for so-called refugees, Hamas and Abbas are clearly stating their intention to turn Israel into a country with an Arab Muslim majority. In this country, perhaps for a price – required Arab jizya payments are actually protection money - some Jews might be allowed to live on sufferance, as dhimmis, tolerated residents of a land conquered by Islam.<br>Those who continue to advocate for the creation of a Palestinian state need to consider that such a state would be backed, politically and militarily, by Iran and its ruling mullahs, whose declared goal is to eliminate the &quot;Zionist entity&quot; Israel, as well as the United States.<br>As Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has stated about the &quot;Little Satan&quot;: &quot;&#39;Death to Israel&#39; is not just a slogan, it is a policy.&quot; The same goes for the &quot;Great Satan&quot; and &quot;Death to America.&quot;<br>In the years leading up to its invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023, Hamas developed a concrete plan to destroy the Jewish state, in full coordination with Iran and its Lebanon-based terror proxy, Hezbollah. According to classified documents published by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, Iran was a critical player in funding Hamas&#39;s plan to destroy Israel.<br>On May 15, Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei reminded us, once again, that in his view, as he posted on X: &quot;The Zionist regime is illegitimate, and the formation of this regime was based on a false premise.&quot; He is actually repeating what he knows is the false claim that Jews have no religious, emotional or historical attachment to their homeland.<br>His post came on the occasion of &quot;Nakba Day.&quot; Many Arabs and Muslims, including Khamenei, continue to dream of the day when they would be able to destroy it. They do not conceal their support for the use of violence to achieve this goal. Furthermore, they never conceal their hatred for the &quot;Little Satan&quot; Israel, and the &quot;Great Satan&quot;, the U.S.<br>On May 4, Khamenei wrote:<br>    &quot;When we, the Muslim Ummah [nation], are detached from each other, the colonial powers – the US, the Zionist regime, and some European and non-European countries – impose their own interests over the interests of other nations.&quot;<br>Iran&#39;s supreme leader is telling Arabs and Muslims that they must unite to confront not only Israel, but also the US and other non-Muslims.<br>In another post on May 15, Khamenei wrote:<br>    &quot;Palestinian political, military and cultural fight should continue until those [Jews] who have usurped Palestine submit to the vote of the Palestinian nation.&quot;<br>For Iran&#39;s mullahs, the &quot;military fight&quot; means unleashing terrorism against Israel by their Palestinian, Lebanese, and Yemeni terror proxies: Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.<br>In the context of his anti-US rhetoric and policy, Khamenei recently scoffed at US President Donald J. Trump&#39;s visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates and his talk about achieving peace and prosperity. &quot;Trump said he wants to use power for peace,&quot; Khamenei wrote on May 17:<br>    &quot;Some of the remarks made during the US President&#39;s trip to the region aren&#39;t even worth a response at all. The level of those remarks is so low that they are a source of shame for the American nation.&quot;<br>He later added:<br>    &quot;Trump said he wants to use power for peace. He&#39;s lying.&quot;<br>The Trump administration should beware of countries where the mouth says one thing but the legs do the opposite. Believe the legs. The Iranians and Palestinians have not given up their dream of eliminating Israel and America.<br>The Trump administration also should realize that Palestinian and Iranian leaders tell Westerners one thing - what they like to hear - in English, while addressing their people with completely different messages in Arabic and Farsi. Believe the Arabic and Farsi.<br>Mahmoud Abbas has long been telling Westerners about his desire to make peace and establish a Palestinian state next to Israel; at the same time, he keeps calling for Israel&#39;s destruction.<br>Iran&#39;s leaders do the same thing. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reassures Americans that &quot;We are not seeking war, we favor negotiation and dialogue.&quot; Meanwhile, Khamenei calls for the elimination of the &quot;Zionist regime&quot; and endorses &quot;Death to America.&quot;<br>The Palestinians and Iran&#39;s mullahs believe that Americans and most Westerners are gullible enough to unreservedly swallow any lie – they so often have in the past.<br>It is time for the Trump administration and other Westerners to see that the Palestinians and the Iranian regime do not want Israel or America in the Middle East - period - and are prepared to do anything to achieve this goal, including with nuclear weapons.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R218" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">219</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ÔI LUẬT SƯ NẶC NÔ: EM TỒ VÀO MẶT CHÚNG!<br>Khi giới thiệu Ann Coulter là luật sư, ít ai rõ nếu không theo dõi từ vài chục năm.

[who provided] Mr. Trump with legal arguments he used to try to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.” <br>Further proving that this was Eastman’s idea all along, there&#39;s an 8-by-10-inch photo of him accompanying VanSickle&#39;s story, titled, &quot;At Supreme Court, a Once-Fringe Birthright Citizenship Theory Takes the Spotlight.&quot;<br>Upon publication of VanSickle&#39;s article, every journalist on TV became an expert on the issue, regurgitating her preposterous claim that Eastman is the brains behind the idea - oh, and by the way, this is the guy who tried to overturn the 2020 election.<br>So I guess you don&#39;t have to know anything more!I&#39;m not comparing Eastman to Hitler, except in the sense that Hitler was not the first person to come up with the idea that smoking is bad for your health - just as Eastman is not the first person to argue that the 14th Amendment has nothing to do with anchor babies. Why falsely identify him as the originator of that view (which happens to be correct) unless you&#39;re trying to discredit the argument without ever having to explain it, much less refute it?<br>This is like ad hominem by proxy. You find someone who&#39;s easy to attack, then designate that person as the sole purveyor of an argument you don&#39;t like.But just to be extra sure that Eastman is the inventor of the &quot;wacky idea&quot; that the 14th Amendment has nothing to do with illegal immigrants, VanSickle checked with Eastman himself. And guess what? He&#39;s delighted to claim full credit. (So in addition to being &quot;obscure,&quot; Eastman is also what&#39;s known as &quot;a delusional narcissist.&quot;) <br>E.g.:-- &quot;Mr. Eastman said that the president did not directly consult him about the birthright citizenship order but that several of his friends ... &#39;knew that my scholarship was kind of at the forefront of this.’”- &quot;Mr. Eastman said Mr. Trump was &#39;likely&#39; referring to him [when he cited many lawyers who agreed with him on anchor babies].&quot; <br>Is this really how the Times determines authorship? Ask the person claiming credit: Tell the truth. Is this your idea? (Glad they weren&#39;t on the Claudine Gay plagiarism investigation.) According to VanSickle, Eastman first made the argument in a 2004 amicus brief to the Supreme Court. The case had nothing to do with anchor babies, and Eastman&#39;s brief was not read by the court - much less by Donald Trump - but let&#39;s take 2004 as our marker. Here are just a few people whose scholarship on the issue far preceded Eastman&#39;s.<br>In 1985, Yale professors Peter Schuck and Rogers Smith - no slouches - published a book, &quot;Citizenship Without Consent: Illegal Aliens in the American Policy,” making this inarguable point: &quot;The parents of [illegals] are, by definition, individuals whose presence within the jurisdiction of the United States is prohibited by law and to whom the society has explicitly and self-consciously decided to deny membership. And if the society has refused to consent to their membership, it can hardly be said to have consented to that of their children who happen to be born while their parents are here in violation of American law.&quot;<br>Schuck and Smith simply take it for granted that anchor babies are not mandated by the 14th Amendment. They write that the debates &quot;establish that the framers of the Citizenship Clause had no intention of establishing a universal rule of birthright citizenship.&quot; <br>(In VanSickle&#39;s telling, this description of the debates doesn&#39;t appear in the Yale professors’ 1985 book: It&#39;s just a &quot;claim&quot; made by Eastman.)<br>In the summer of 1996, Dan Stein and John Bauer published an article in the Stanford Law &amp; Policy Review, also arguing that the Constitution does not mandate anchor babies: “Interpreting the 14th Amendment: Automatic Citizenship for Children of Illegal Immigrants?”<br>Then, in 2003, the late Richard Posner, 7th Circuit Appellate judge, wrote a concurring opinion in Oforji v. Ashcroft for the express purpose of demanding that Congress stop “awarding citizenship to everyone born in the United States.” He said he doubted that this was the meaning of the 14th Amendment and pleaded with Congress to pass a law and “put an end to the nonsense.” <br>Say you&#39;re a reporter for the Newspaper of Record, trying to fairly summarize the debate over the 14th Amendment and anchor babies. Do you cite Posner, the most-cited federal judge, regularly called a &quot;genius&quot; by his peers - including the late Justice Antonin Scalia - and one of the 100 judges listed in &quot;Great American Judges: An Encyclopedia&quot;? Two Yale professors? A Stanford legal journal? Or do you cite a disbarred, debunked &quot;obscure California law professor&quot; who helped Trump try to overturn the 2020 election? <br>The choice is obvious. You cite the kook.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R219" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">220</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/21/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">“ALL THINGS…” TUẦN NÀY CỦA KIMBERLEY STRASSEL:<br>Bỉnh bút xuất sắc của WSJ, sống cùng con tại Alaska mà điểm tin trong tuần còn chính xác hơn mấy cha nội đội nón ra vào thủ đô Mỹ. <br>Kỳ này, nàng điểm danh xem những ai có tội vì che giấu tình trạng sức khỏe của Joe Biden: năm loại, và loại tục tĩu nhất, đứng đầu là chị vợ cứ tự xưng là bác sĩ, rất vần với… con mỹ!

(and beyond), providing the inside track on both the overhyped and overlooked events of the week.<br>Who to Blame for the Biden Coverup<br>The code of silence that for years shut down any discussion of Joe Biden’s mental and physical decline was in some ways a collective-action failure - Democrats and the press were so invested in stopping Donald Trump and winning the election that they neglected truth and the country. But with those battles lost, the publication of “Original Sin” - the new Biden tell-all from Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper that hit the stands Tuesday - and Biden’s Sunday cancer diagnosis, seemed to open floodgates. Suddenly, everyone has a story about Biden’s incapacities, and suddenly people are more willing to name names.<br>The lucky Democrats are those who had limited contact with Biden, and who are now excusing their prior claims of his good health on situational grounds. As in: ”Well, the few times I was with him, he was fine.” And there are plenty of these, since “Original Sin” confirms that as time went by, Biden’s handlers walled off the president. But we are at least now hearing the name of the handlers who worked to keep Biden’s frailties secret, and anecdotes of other players who were clearly presented evidence there was a problem, yet did nothing. Let’s take stock:<br>1/    Jill Biden: The president’s wife wasn’t shy about her ambition to occupy the White House a full eight years. Interviewed by the New Yorker’s David Remnick, author Thompson recounts: “As someone put it within the family: All Presidents run for two terms. The First Lady’s team was already plotting ‘What are we going to do in a second term?’ very, very early on.” He says that Mrs. Biden was viewed as the head “protector” and that Biden aides described her “as one of the most powerful First Ladies in American history.” Thompson reported last summer that Mrs. Biden and her top aide, Anthony Bernal, went so far as to separate the president from the White House residence staff, blocking butlers and other household workers from interacting with Joe. Family members are of course those most likely to see mental decline and to recognize it; the former first lady even today insists her husband is fine.<br>2/    The aides: A picture is forming of that handful of aides trusted by the Biden family to act as intermediaries between Biden and the world, to limit his exposure, and to squelch any questions about his health. They included Bernal, Ron Klain (chief of staff until 2023), Bruce Reed and Annie Tomasini (deputy chiefs of staff), Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti (advisers), and national-security officials Jake Sullivan and Antony Blinken. A quote from a Biden cabinet secretary in “Original Sin”: “I’ve never seen a situation like this before, with so few people having so much power. They would make huge economic decisions without calling [Treasury] secretary [ Janet] Yellen.” Evidence is meanwhile surfacing that these aides didn’t just hide Biden from the public; they hid information from Biden, including the reality of just how many elected Democrats wanted him out.<br>3/    The doctors: In particular, Kevin O’Connor, who became Biden’s personal physician in 2009, helped with Beau Biden’s cancer care, and was tapped to become physician to the president in 2021. O’Connor, who is described as close with the Biden family, consistently pronounced Biden “fit for duty” - though he rarely took or answered questions. Reporting shows that O’Connor also continued to insist that Biden did not need a cognitive test, despite many doctors administering regular cognitive exams when their patients hit their 60s (Biden was inaugurated at 78). From the Thompson interview with Remnick: “Biden’s personal physician said, ‘Well, I see him every day. And the cognitive exam is made for physicians who only see their patients every several months. And if you doubt that he is cognitively capable - listen, he is doing the job.’” If O’Connor did see him every day, why didn’t he report what everyone else is now admitting? Add in the news that the president’s medical team failed to diagnose Biden’s metastatic cancer, which is advanced enough to have started years ago.<br>4/   The Cabinet: The book, as well as the recent release of the audio of former special counsel Robert Hur’s interview with Biden, further point to officials who should have understood there was a problem. “Original Sin” recounts that cabinet members were disturbed that the few cabinet meetings that occurred were almost entirely stage-managed, with scripts, so that Biden would look in command. Why did nobody say anything? And then there’s former Attorney General Merrick Garland, who was in possession of those hours of Hur audio recordings—and who refused to release them to the GOP House. Garland testified to the House last year that he hadn’t listened to the audio when he refused to release it. Why not? Republicans wanted the tapes to help judge Biden’s mental fitness. Had these cabinet members made a point of finding out Biden’s true state, they might have been expected to act. Nobody wanted to know.<br>5/   The press: “Original Sin” somehow manages to skip over the press’s own omertà when it came to Biden’s failing health. Tapper, one of the authors, was among those who berated anyone who questioned Biden’s fitness for office. The excuse: No one was willing to talk until after the election. But hard stories are hard for a reason, and few in the press made this a cause until late in Biden’s term.<br>Democrats now argue we should ignore the coverup because it’s old news; they lost, let’s move on. But let’s not forget that they had every intention of using it to win. And had they pulled it off, the country could at this moment be coping with a constitutional crisis (were Biden incapacitated and his inner cabal unwilling to give up power), or saddled with Kamala Harris if Biden stepped down. The country deserves the truth, in part to consider ways to guard against a repeat.<br>‘The Apprentice,’ Federal Edition<br>The administration on Friday officially asked the Supreme Court to reaffirm Trump’s power to issue his catchphrase - “you’re fired” -only this time to thousands of federal workers. The case is one of the more high-profile Trump-related issues destined for the high court, which could clarify the extent of a president’s power to manage the executive-branch workforce.<br>Solicitor General D. John Sauer’s emergency application asks the Supremes to lift a lower-court block on the administration’s efforts to fire federal workers across 17 agencies. California district court judge Susan Illston recently issued a sweeping restraining order, barring a Trump executive order that put into motion some 40 “reduction in force” (RIF) efforts across the government. Federal unions, nonprofits and local governments all sued, while more than 20 states have also filed amicus briefs supporting the workers. Illston ruled the workers were likely to win, on grounds that Trump cannot “engage in large-scale overhauls of federal agencies” without the approval of Congress.<br>Sauer’s application disagrees, claiming Congress has long “recognized the Executive Branch’s authority to carry out reductions in its workforce as the need arises,” and points to Bill Clinton’s order in 1993 that all federal agencies with more than 100 employees “eliminate not less than 4 percent of [their] civilian personnel positions” within three years. The solicitor general points out that “RIFs are indisputably permitted by federal law” and must be challenged in special administrative or judicial settings as defined by civil-service laws. He reminds the Supreme Court that only last month it lifted a stay on the administration’s efforts to fire probationary workers in six cabinet departments, and argues it should do the same here, as Illston’s order is even more expansive.<br>That’s also the catch. The sheer depth of the Trump cuts is what critics argue make the legal questions in this case different. Illston in her opinion focuses on several examples of Trump RIFs that the plaintiffs claim are so large as to reduce or end the capacity to administer certain programs. The judge claims that since Congress created these programs, it must have a role in deciding if they are altered or continued. Meaning the case may to some extent touch on bigger questions of presidential authority.<br>In any event, the Supremes won’t be deciding the merits now - simply whether to allow the administration to proceed until the case can be litigated in full. But their handling of the emergency application could provide hints as to future thinking.<br>The Senate Decides to Run the Senate<br>Majority Leader John Thune on Tuesday announced the Senate will push ahead this week with a vote to kill Biden waivers that allowed California (and other states) to establish aggressive electric-vehicle mandates that threaten to kill off the internal-combustion engine. The House already used the Congressional Review Act to kill the waivers in early May, but the Senate Republican caucus has been more hesitant.<br>Why? Because the Government Accountability Office - the nonpartisan agency that helps Congress fulfill its legislative duties - decided that the Biden waivers didn’t official count as a “rule” and thus wasn’t subject to the CRA, even though Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin submitted them as such. The Senate parliamentarian seconded the GAO’s opinion. Democrats are howling that Republicans are taking an unprecedented action that will demolish important Senate safeguards, an accusation that has made some Republicans nervous about moving ahead.<br>The better read: It’s the GAO that is acting in unprecedented fashion, given its longtime position that all actions an agency submits to Congress are to be treated as rules. The question is why it reversed itself for this very high-profile Biden rule. Moreover, GAO has no statutory role under CRA. As an unelected bureaucracy, it fulfills an informal, advisory role. It has historically said that its opinion counts only when agencies don’t submit actions to Congress that should be considered rules. (This excellent analysis goes through the legal and precedent problems with GAO’s opinion, while Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso lays out a strong argument for proceeding here.) As Republicans note, the weirdness of GAO’s move makes the likelihood of a repeat situation unlikely - knocking down Democratic claims that this is the beginning of the end of Senate safeguards.<br>The GAO oddity if anything heightens the need for Republicans to hold the vote. Yes, it is important to give deference to the (sometimes) neutral gatekeepers. But when those bureaucracies start making up things as they go, the Senate needs to reassure the public that it is the Senate still in charge.<br>BY THE NUMBERS:<br>[18] “Important” countries that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent now expects the U.S. to do trade deals with in its 90-day pause in tariffs (rather than the original target of 90 countries in 90 days).

The state will award 20,000 scholarships for the 2025-26 school year, to be used at some 200 participating private schools.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R220" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">221</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/21/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">OVER MY SHOULDER CỦA MAULDIN ECONOMICS<br>Hôm nay John Mauldin và Patrick Watson tóm lược năm lãnh vực chúng ta nên chú ý.

I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!”<br>Item two: “After causing catastrophic inflation, Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls . . . Her plan is very dangerous because it may sound good politically... This is Communist; this is Marxist; this is fascist.”<br>If you guessed that both are statements by Donald Trump, you have broken the code on the bizarro world of the President’s second-term economic policies. Last year he blasted Kamala Harris’s proposal for price controls on groceries. But now he is attacking Walmart for warning that it will have to raises prices in the wake of Mr. Trump’s tariffs.<br>Mr. Trump’s flip-flop on price controls is a rebuttal of his own previous tariff claims. For months he’s said that foreign producers pay the full cost of tariffs. But now he’s admitting that Walmart, an American retailer, will have to eat some of the costs or pass them on to Americans.<br>Despite his business background, Mr. Trump doesn’t know much about retail. Walmart’s net profit margin is below 3%, so it doesn’t have much room to absorb the higher costs caused by tariffs. Retail competition is intense, and Walmart’s longtime comparative advantage has been lower prices. [Đúng rồi, nhắc giáo chủ về kế toán may ra ngài bớt nói nhảm!]<br>Mr. President is telling a company how to run its business, along with a vague, implicit threat of retribution. Marxist?

Its coffers bled dry by a staggering debt that ranks second only to New York City. That debt is largely driven by the iron grip of powerful unions that have long dictated the city’s political pulse.

They tend to win.<br>Ted Dabrowski is president of Wirepoints, a Chicago-based non-profit pushing for an overhaul of how public union pensions are funded.<br>Ted Dabrowski: They’re not taking the taxpayer money to put it into the pension funds, but what they have been doing is giving it to the workers to get even bigger salaries, which makes even bigger pensions. So the hole keeps getting bigger. They keep giving out more benefits in order to buy off the unions and get votes. So you’ve got this kind of marriage between the politicians and the unions to take care of each other, and it’s the ordinary people who are left out having to pay bigger and bigger taxes.<br>Right now, Chicago’s pension funds are a shocking $53 billion short.

November 18, 2024. AP/Ohad Zwigenberg<br>ALAN DERSHOWITZ<br>(By ALAN DERSHOWITZ - NY Sun - May. 21, 2025 06:20 AM ET)<br>Updated: May. 21, 2025 07:27 AM ET<br>There can be little doubt that over the last quarter of a century Israeli voters have moved to the center from the left, and now to the right. The same is true, though to a somewhat lesser degree, of Israeli supporters in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and other countries with significant Jewish populations. The primary reason is obvious: The left has turned against Israel and against its supporters.<br>Jews have traditionally been on the left side of politics both in Israel and in the diaspora. When Israel was first established, it had widespread support among the left, even among the extreme left. At its founding, Israel was a socialist democracy surrounded by reactionary Arab dictatorships.<br>Not surprisingly, the Soviet Union supported its establishment in 1948, and Czechoslovakia even supplied it with arms to defend itself against invading Arab nations. This all changed in the 1960s when the Soviet Union decided to abandon left-wing Israel and support the right-wing Arab states that were seeking Israel’s destruction.<br>The reason for this switch was purely power politics: The undemocratic Arab states were rich in natural resources, especially oil and gas; they also had geographical advantages such as the Suez Canal. Israel on the other hand was an agrarian socialist state with few natural or geographic resources; they exported Jaffa oranges and mud from the Dead Sea.<br>When the Soviet Union turned against Israel and in favor of Arab Tyrannies, the European and American hard-left fell in line. Euro-communist parties followed the lead of the Soviet Union, as did the American Communist party. Most moderate leftists continued to support Israel, especially during the Six Day War in 1967.<br>Israeli voters generally continued to support left-wing candidates until 1977, when Menachem Begin won a surprising victory. Since that time the trend among Israeli voters has been slightly right, though left-of-center candidates such as Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak won elections in 1992 and 1999.<br>Then, two developments began to move Israeli voters discernibly to the right. The first was the immigration of hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews into Israel. These Jews had experienced discrimination and persecution from Communist regimes throughout the Soviet Union. Not surprisingly, they did not trust the left. These new immigrants asserted themselves politically and formed alliances primarily with center-right and right-wing parties.<br>Israel is a vibrant and dynamic democracy, where outcomes depend on the experiences, history, and ideology of the voters. So the influx of anti-Communist Soviet Jews had an immediate impact on Israeli politics, moving it to the right.<br>The second reason for the rightward movement by Israeli voters is the Arab rejectionism of Israeli peace offers. The most striking was the 2000-2001 peace initiative by a liberal prime minister, Mr. Barak, and President Clinton. Here is the way Clinton characterized the offer:<br>“[The] peace deal that we had worked out… would have given the Palestinians a state in 96% of the West Bank and 4% of Israel, and they got to choose where the 4% of Israel was. So they would have the effect of the same land of all the West Bank. They would have a capital in east Jerusalem…<br>“All this was offered including… a capital in east Jerusalem and two of the four quadrants of the old city of Jerusalem confirmed by the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barack and his cabinet, and they said no, and I think part of it is that Hamas did not care about a homeland for the Palestinians. They wanted to kill Israelis and make Israel uninhabitable.”<br>This rejection of a two-state solution was accompanied by an intifada in which thousands of Israeli and Palestinian civilians were killed. This led to the weakening of the Israeli left and the strengthening of the right. Many centrist Israeli voters grew frustrated with the failed efforts of the “peace camp” to achieve a two-state solution through negotiation and compromise. Israelis began to believe that terrorism could be prevented and/or deterred only through military actions.<br>Then came Hamas. In 2005, Israel’s conservative prime minister, Ariel Sharon, unilaterally ended Israel’s occupation of Gaza and turned Israeli equipment over to Palestinian leaders in an effort to create a viable Palestinian enclave - Singapore on the Mediterranean. Hamas then proceeded to murder Palestinian authority leaders and take over the Gaza Strip in an unlawful coup. <br>Hamas then proceeded to fire rockets into Israel for years.<br>This belligerency culminated in the October 7 massacres and kidnappings. The victims were primarily Israeli leftists and peaceniks who are active in efforts to bring about a two-state solution. Not surprisingly, October 7 weakened the left and strengthened the right.<br>The reaction of the left to October 7, and the positive support given by many to the Hamas barbarism, moved many Jews out of their traditional left-wing base and toward a more conservative perspective.<br>The above analysis is not intended either to justify or criticize this obvious right-ward movement among many Israelis and their supporters around the world. It is intended to explain a phenomenon that many seem not to understand. It should be expected that when the left turns against a nation and its supporters and the right turns toward them, there will be a change in attitudes and voting patterns. <br>Many people somehow believe, however, that Israelis and Jews should be different: They should continue to support the left even though the left has abandoned them. To expect Israelis and Jews to act against their interest, though, is to impose an unacceptable double standard.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R224" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">225</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỘT BÀI ĐIỂM SÁCH CÔNG PHU:<br> Trên Substack riêng (tên là LONG WALLS - Geopolitics, Grand Strategy, Economic Statecraft, Technology, Policy, and the defense of the West), hôm nay tiến sĩ Leonard Hochberg điểm cuốn sách của giáo sư Hal Brands thuộc Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies: “THE EURASIAN CENTURY Hot Wars, Cold Wars, and the Making of the Modern World” do nhà W.

W. Norton &amp; Company, 2025)<br> OVERVIEW<br> Dr. Hal Brands, a professor of American history and foreign policy at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, has written a useful and significant study of the international system from 1900 through the first quarter of the 21st century. The volume may be divided into three interrelated themes.<br> First, Brands rapidly traces the history of democratic versus autocratic geopolitical thought for the general reader. Halford Mackinder, Alfred Thayer Mahan, and Nicholas Spykman - the defenders of Western democracies - and Major General Karl Haushofer and Aleksandr Dugin - the proponents of Eurasian autocracies - each receive an appropriate mention. However, it is the work of Halford Mackinder that receives pride of place for having predicted the essential feature of the hot and cold wars of the modern world: In short, the offshore maritime powers of Great Britain, and later the United States, sought to maintain the balance of power in Eurasia. Why? To ensure that no one power or alliance of land-based powers would manage to unify Eurasia, thereby gaining undisputed access to the manpower and resources of that supercontinent. Such access would allow a unified Eurasia to build fleets that could threaten the thalassocracies of Great Britain and the U.S.<br> The second theme, a historical treatment of the hot wars and cold wars that erupted across Eurasia since the dawn of the twentieth century, comprises the bulk of Brand’s book. Approximately 40 pages is devoted to the origins, course, and consequences of World War I, World War II, the Cold War between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S., and the second Cold War between the P.R.C. and the U.S. These four chapters are strategic histories, as Colin Gray would have characterized them, rather than general histories of each period. The author elaborates the grand strategies of the protagonists, discusses military campaigns, evaluates the strategic dilemmas that decision makers attempted to resolve during their respective conflicts, and considers the consequences, intended and otherwise, of defeat or victory.<br> Third, Brands ends his book with policy recommendations. He draws these recommendations from how Great Britain and the United States managed to emerge victorious in the first three conflicts. The maritime powers frequently delayed addressing the dangers presented by the Eurasian autocracies - their quest for more territory, more manpower, more resources, more power - until it was almost too late. Brands suggests it is critical to maintain strong alliances to contain and deter such adversaries. Furthermore, military capability must be cultivated to issue timely and credible threats. The goal: keep Eurasia internally divided.<br> In effect, our current danger grew out of the fact that the United States assumed that, after the Cold War, liberal democracy was the wave of the future. However, the diffusion of our values and institutions depended not merely on the prestige that victory over the U.S.S.R. conferred on the United States, but more significantly on the maintenance of military capability. Reliance on a “rules based international order” is woefully insufficient in maintaining the hard power needed to guarantee national security. Furthermore, post-cold war hegemonic power of the United States prompted China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, despite their ideological differences, to eventually team up.[1] These revisionist powers seek to make the world safe for empire, their empires. Grey zone conflicts, proxy wars, and the threat of war have occurred across the Eurasian rimland.<br> CARTOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATIONS OF STRATEGIC HISTORY<br> There is much to recommend this book, not the least of which is the reintroduction of classical geopolitical theory to the general reader. Brands deserves applause for having done so as a way of making sense of our current situation. Many faculty will adopt this book as a secondary reading in advanced courses in the fields of American foreign policy, strategy, and national security. <br> Nevertheless, there is one troubling and obvious oversight that should be highlighted: The general reader and the student will search in vain for maps drawn specifically to highlight classical geopolitical thought and Brands’ geohistorical arguments. A historical atlas will need to be purchased and carefully interpreted to get the most out of The Eurasian Century.<br> Furthermore, while one should never judge a book by its cover, perhaps it is legitimate to judge a cover by the themes presented in a book. The cover of Brands’ book depicts three Eurasian maps along a horizontal timeline, ~1890 to ~2030. In the first, overlaid on the timeline from ~1890 to 1930-1945, Central and Western Europe are highlighted, presumably as the Eurasian geopolitical cockpit of the period; in the third, 1978-1992 to ~2030, China, Taiwan, and the territories along the southern and western borders of China are highlighted as the new flashpoint. But what about the map of Eurasia that corresponds to the period 1930-1945 through 1978-1992?<br> Given the thesis of the book, a reader might expect to see the territory of the U.S.S.R. and the Warsaw Pact highlighted - that is the power that threatened the stability of Eurasia during the Cold War. Instead, the territory of the Indian subcontinent (including Pakistan and Bangladesh) is highlighted! What? How did this cartographic error occur? Publishers, not authors, frequently have control over what book covers depict; yet, given this egregious mistake, did the publisher miss the point of the book? Why didn’t the author demand that the central map be changed to reflect the Soviet threat?<br> Maps in a book about geopolitics do not merely adorn the argument. They should, at the very least, depict the locations mentioned in the text, saving the reader from having to constantly consult a historical atlas. However, to be truly effective, maps should offer a visual display of strategic concepts, highlight theoretically relevant locations where military conflicts begin, intensify, and are resolved, and indicate the relationship of process to critical locations, such as international commerce to maritime chokepoints.[2]<br> GEOGRAPHY, EURASIA, AND MACKINDER’S HEARTLAND THESIS<br> The cartography on the cover is indicative of some deeper issues. Let’s start with the basics. Geographers frequently characterize regions as either “uniform” in nature or “functional.” A uniform region is characterized by its one essential and significant characteristic - for instance, an “industrial” region - to enable a comparison with another, different uniform region - such as an “agricultural” region. Brands frequently deploys “Eurasia” as a “uniform” region.[3] Why?<br> Brands may believe that the China-Russia-Iran-North Korea proto-alliance gives rise to a politically uniform region in which autocracy is the most salient characteristic. Or he may believe that the Trans-Siberian Railroad, when connected to the various transportation projects promoted by China under the Belt and Road and other infrastructure initiatives, has produced or will soon produce a single economic unit in Eurasia. Or he may have emphasized Europe and Asia as a unified source of danger to the United States as distinct from the China challenge in the Indo-Pacific region.[4] Geography is often gerrymandered for political purposes. These three points are mere speculation.<br> A fourth possibility is that Brands is simplifying his geographic terminology to appeal to an audience of general readers that, in the words of the old rock and roll song, “don’t know much about geography…” Turning to the text, Brands suggests that Mackinder’s stunning 1904 presentation on “The Geographical Pivot of History”[5] combined vague abstraction, meandering narration, distant history, and mountains of geographical detail. The talk featured a long, if graceful, discussion of rivers, steppes, peaks and monsoon lands; it was full of concepts (“Pivot Area,” “Inner Crescent,” “Outer Crescent”) that then probably seemed obscure.[6]<br> Mackinder was addressing an audience of geographers and imperial policy makers, most of whom knew where the Ural Mountains, Manchuria, the Volga River, etc. were to be found. Did Mackinder depict his “obscure” concepts with maps? According to Dr. Brian Blouet, Mackinder’s biographer, Mackinder “illustrated” his talk, probably to identify the location where his concepts applied to Eurasian and world history.[7] In the published version of “The Geographical Pivot of History,” Mackinder deployed five figures, the fifth of which explicitly showed the locations of these supposedly “obscure” concepts.[8]<br> So, how does Hal Brands define Eurasia? Much depends on this definition, as “Eurasia” is not visualized in a map, even though it is his key unit of geographic analysis.<br> As the name implies, Eurasia consists of the combined expanse of those two Old World continents of the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia. It includes the outlying islands of those continents, which are closely connected to them by Eurasia’s marginal seas, as well as North Africa, which is thoroughly linked to Europe by the Mediterranean as it is blocked from the rest of Africa by the Sahara. Eurasia thus runs from littoral Asia in the East to the Iberian Peninsula and the British Isles in the West, from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Indian Ocean in the south. This “world island,” as geographer Halford Mackinder called it, is a space unlike any other.[9]<br> All but the last sentence in this characterization is correct.<br> In his masterpiece Democratic Ideals and Reality,[10] Mackinder defines the “world-island” as comprised of six (uniform) subregions: (1) the Sahara, (2) the Southern Heartland,[11] south of sub-Saharan Africa, (3) Arabia, (4) the Monsoon Coastlands (of India, Southwest Asia, and China), (5) the “European Coastland,” and finally - Mackinder’s particular contribution to our understanding of geopolitics of the 20th and the first quarter of the 21st century - (6) the “Heartland.” Thus, despite Brands’ assertion that the boundaries of the “world-island” are conterminous with Eurasia, Mackinder includes in the world-island two subregions that fall outside of Eurasia.[12] This may seem to be a mere geographical technicality, but details matter, especially when it comes to what constitutes Brands’ key unit of analysis, Eurasia, which he argues is a regional “prize without equal: it is the strategic center of the world.”[13]<br> Halford Mackinder, when characterizing the world-island, did so as a “functional” region, that is, one in which the humans living in the subregions interacted with one another economically, socially, and militarily. At the strategic center of the world-island is the Geographic Pivot, occupied by Tsarist Russia, and later termed the Eurasian Heartland. In 1904 Mackinder asked,<br> Is not the pivot region of the world&#39;s politics that vast area of Euro-Asia which is inaccessible to ships, but in antiquity lay open to the horse-riding nomads, and is to-day about to be covered with a network of railways? There have been and are here the conditions of a mobility of military and economic power of a far-reaching and yet limited character. Russia replaces the Mongol Empire. Her pressure on Finland, on Scandinavia, on Poland, on Turkey, on Persia, on India, and on China, replaces the centrifugal raids of the steppemen [sic]. In the world at large she occupies the central strategical position held by Germany in Europe. She can strike on all sides and be struck from all sides, save the north. The full development of her modern railway mobility is merely a matter of time.[14]<br> Russia, as the “Pivot” or Heartland power, exerts pressure on the lands along its borders; however, as the Heartland power, it was relatively immune from the influence of maritime power due to rivers flowing to inland seas or the Arctic, and the way the polar ice cap limited the movement of shipping. With the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, Russia acquired not merely the means to access virgin agricultural land and new mineral resources, but also internal lines of communication, travel, and transport - factors essential for rapidly moving and deploying military force. For Mackinder, the Tsarist regime threatened to overturn the balance of power in Europe and beyond by suddenly transforming the territory of the Eurasian Heartland into an economically modern and politically unified new environment.<br> Hal Brands, in emphasizing Eurasia as his unit of geographic analysis, rarely mentions Mackinder’s Heartland thesis. Surprisingly, The Eurasian Century fails to note the Heartland in the index - either as a separate term or under Mackinder’s name. Yet, in one critical passage, Brands mentions the Heartland. He quotes, in an abbreviated fashion, Mackinder’s geopolitical catechism: “Who rules the Heartland rules the World-Island; whoever rules the World-Island commands the World.”[15] Yet here too, Brands misses Mackinder’s deeper point, which is suggested by the full quote from Democratic Ideals and Reality:<br> Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland:<br> Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island:<br> Who rules the World-Island commands the World.[16]<br> Why does East Europe loom so large in Mackinder’s formulation in Democratic Ideals and Reality? First, East Europe was the land over which Germanic and Slavic peoples competed - one of the fundamental causes of World War I for Mackinder. Second, East Europe was (and remains) the gateway to the Heartland. The Northern European plain and the Danube Basin provide the two major land-based invasion routes into the Heartland. Third, in Democratic Ideals and Reality, Mackinder reformulated the Heartland thesis from a geographic region into a strategic region, where the great European autocratic powers threaten the lands along the littorals of the Baltic and Black seas.[17]<br> Finally, Mackinder envisioned Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Great Bohemia, Hungary, Great Rumania, Bulgaria, Great Serbia, and Greece[18] as: (1) a make weight against the revival of German power, (2) a bulwark, keeping the post-war Russian Communist regime outside of Europe, and (3) the foundation for a restored European balance of power. One curiosity: although Ukraine is not explicitly mentioned in the text, it does appear (without territorial boundaries) on Mackinder’s map depicting Eastern Europe.[19] In short, the Wilsonian ideals of national self-determination of the East European states and collective security through the League of Nations needed to be brought into alignment with the realities of power. In Mackinder’s vision, these newly independent nations would align with France and Great Britain, thereby putting the League on a sound footing and restoring a balance of power to Europe.<br> According to Brands, “For Mackinder, then the most critical feature of the peace was not the League of Nations. It was the creation of a cordon sanitaire between Russia and Germany - a ‘tier of independent states’ that, in defending themselves, would keep Eurasia in balance.”[20] This interpretation is correct, but not quite good enough. For Mackinder, the independent states of East Europe, once allied with the democratic and maritime powers of Western Europe, would restore the balance of power and thereby stabilize the League as a mechanism for collective security.<br> Mackinder was not a modern “realist.”[21] He recognized that ideals, such as liberty, equality, and nationalism, had historically become institutionalized as features of reality.[22] Even collective security was on the verge of becoming institutionalized when Mackinder wrote. Such ideals needed to be considered when formulating a foreign policy designed to restructure the international order in the aftermath of World War I. Therefore, the fundamental issue for Mackinder wasn’t ideals versus the reality of power in the international arena; instead, it was how to reconcile democratic ideals with the reality of power. The title of Mackinder book was not Democratic Ideals or Reality.<br> Mackinder’s Democratic Ideals and Realty was written in recognition that post-World War I democratic populations were being carried away by an overly optimistic idea of what collective security could accomplish. A correction was needed; Mackinder supplied it by imagining a new geopolitical order that mobilized many of the hitherto submerged ethnic groups of the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and German empires as autonomous nation-states.[23]<br> Brands alludes to the importance of East Europe when he evaluates the geopolitical ideas of Major General Dr. Karl E. Haushofer, the thinker whose ideas are often associated with the rise of Adolph Hitler. According to Brands: “The world, wrote Haushofer, needed ‘a general political cleaning up, a redistribution of power.’ The young Eastern European countries lying athwart Germany’s path were ‘state fragments’ that ‘have no longer a right to exist.’”[24] Brands is no doubt correct in interpreting Haushofer’s sentiment toward the East European states as a quest for lebensraum.<br> But it was more than just that. Haushofer’s attack on the legitimacy of the East European nations as mere “fragments” of states was tantamount to an assault on the inter-war balance of power, which was upheld by the alliances led by France and Great Britain. In the absence of a full-blown interpretation of Mackinder’s purpose in writing Democratic Ideals and Reality, Brands cannot provide a nuanced appreciation of Haushofer’s geopolitical thought and rhetorical tactics.<br> CONCLUSION<br> In the final analysis, Hal Brands’ book deserves to be read and discussed among students of international relations and within the foreign policy establishment. However, it does not do justice to the subtleties of classical geopolitical thought. At times, the geography in geopolitics is suppressed in favor of an aspatial assessment of great power competition and conflict. Brand’s failure to provide cartographic visualizations of strategic interactions is a telling aspect of how the geographic component in geopolitics is obscured.<br> Indeed, had Hal Brands attended to Mackinder’s overriding goal in Democratic Ideals and Reality - how to reconcile the enthusiasms and ideals of democracies with the geopolitical realities of power in international relations - he might have offered a more nuanced appreciation of how ideology and geopolitics should interact in the formulation of foreign policy. While he is undoubtedly correct that “ideology and geopolitics are inseparable,”[25] this assertion is an insufficient guide to where, under what conditions, and at what cost maritime-commercial powers should ally with a territorial-autocratic regime of the Heartland to keep Eurasia divided.<br> Acknowledgements: The author thanks Paul Rahe, Jim Sheehan, Kelly Jordan, Geoff Sloan and Michael Hochberg for their comments.

In practice, however, the policy tremors emanating from Washington are shaking the regional foundations of the very economy the President hopes to build.<br> First came the funding freezes, threatening to choke off vital resources for research and innovation. Next came tariffs, which jeopardize the imports and exports that drive regional prosperity. And now the proposed dismantling of the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) signals a withdrawal of traditional federal support from local economic development almost completely.<br> One hundred and twenty days in, the dispatch from the ground is clear: The Administration’s top-down economic agenda needs to be suffused with some bottom-up perspective on how strong regions - and through them, a strong nation - are built.<br> Potential allies?<br> The President would find the field of economic development sympathetic to key elements of his worldview. Trained in cluster theory, most economic developers would agree that, for all the benefits of globalization, the United States also lost something important when high-end value chains once rooted domestically were scattered across the globe.1 The nation has had to relearn that the production process itself is a catalyst for innovation and source of competitive advantage.<br> Economic developers have their gripes with U.S. trade policy, too. Mainstream economics long focused on the macro (trade imbalances) and the micro (individual businesses and consumers) but overlooked the meso, or regional scale of labor markets and production networks. The “China Shock” body of work successfully flipped the script. Finally, there is widespread understanding that, because of their unique industrial mixes, regions are the scale at which trade policy comes to ground.<br> Economic developers would also find common ground with the President in recognizing that Americans identify as both consumers and producers. Communities, like people, derive a large part of their identity from what they produce. Incomplete or failed industrial transitions are therefore social problems in addition to economic ones.<br> And of course, economic developers love a good ribbon-cutting too.<br> But even if there is basic agreement around the ends, the means with which the White House is going about transforming the American economy will in fact make it harder for regions to develop and grow.<br> EDA: The bridge between federal intent and local action<br> Since the 1960s, the federal government has partnered with communities to support their economic development through the EDA. With modest resources - EDA’s budget stood at $464 million in FY2024 (around 0.02% of total discretionary spending) - the federal government empowers the development and execution of local growth strategies nationwide. Eliminating the only federal agency solely dedicated to economic development, as proposed in the President’s FY2026 budget, would devastate many localities’ ability to invest in their own future and undermine the Administration’s own economic goals.<br> For starters, EDA inspires local action. Its competitive grant programs incentivize communities to come up with the best ideas to achieve a goal - be it to improve tech-based workforce development or enhance regional resilience to economic shocks.<br> Take the new Tech Hubs program, launched with bipartisan-backing as the regional plank of the CHIPS and Science Act. The competition motivated nearly 400 regions to submit their best strategies for cementing American competitiveness and security in the technologies of the future.2 Such programs tap into Americans’ competitive zeal and can bring forth surges of civic entrepreneurship. Each administration can put its own imprint on such programs by setting the goals and shaping the application criteria.<br> EDA also serves as a delivery mechanism for key funding streams that support the President’s economic agenda. The Department of Labor administers Trade Adjustment Assistance for workers, but trade adjustment assistance to help firms and regions rebound from trade-related job losses is delivered through EDA.3 EDA’s core programs help communities navigate military base closures, power plant decommissions, and other economic shocks to smooth the transition to new industries. Its Economic Adjustment Assistance program is a swiss army knife of responsive support tailored to local circumstances. Few federal programs are as adaptable.<br> EDA also serves as a capacity builder. If the Administration’s envisioned future (with a dramatically diminished federal presence in the economy) is not to be one of widening regional inequality, communities will need to be able to fend for themselves. EDA’s planning and technical assistance grants help level the playing field. For small population communities, federal support in the form of EDA planning grants can make the difference between having a professional economic development organization and not.<br> EDA itself is a policy incubator. It serves as a uniquely flexible and remarkably experimentative corner of the federal government. EDA has emerged as the regional arm of American industrial policy. When disasters strike, Congress pushes long-term economic recovery dollars through EDA. When the federal government wishes to pilot new industry-aligned models of workforce development, it goes through EDA. EDA programs have been instrumental at critical junctures in the lives of some of the most innovative and entrepreneurial new economic development organizations to emerge in recent years - including around Opportunity Zones, demonstrating how EDA’s capacity-building programs can complement signature administration initiatives.<br> In a testament to EDA’s utility - and to how out of step the President’s proposal is with the bipartisan policy consensus that regards EDA as more valuable today than ever - Congress finally reauthorized the agency in January. The legislation passed 399-18 in the House and 97-1 in the Senate and empowered EDA with a whole new set of tools and authorities that this President can be the first to deploy.<br> To be sure, the nation’s economic development apparatus could use a healthy dose of disruption. Duplication across agencies and programs is a long-standing concern. Evaluation should be more rigorous. Too much federal economic development spending supports talking instead of doing. Strategic ambivalence between concentrating public investment in a few places versus distributing it widely plagues too many programs. But those challenges call for smart reforms, not wholesale elimination.4<br> That shaking feeling<br> The proposal to shut down EDA is the clearest signal yet that the Trump administration plans to jettison the federal government’s long-standing commitment to being a supportive partner in local economic development. But worse than a partner who moves on is one who actively undermines, and the President’s actions are simultaneously placing the two most fundamental pillars of economic development under strain: traded sectors and anchor institutions.<br> Traded sectors are the means by which regions earn their incomes: they power local economies by producing goods or services that get consumed (sold) outside the region, bringing money into it. Paying high wages, their strong multipliers make them engines of local job growth.<br> Sustaining and growing traded sectors is in many ways the very essence of economic development. These traded sectors are intricately woven into global supply chains. That makes them highly dependent on imports and highly vulnerable to export retaliation. A few regions may score new investments induced by tariffs to U.S. shores; more will likely emerge with weakened firms and dried up export opportunities. The inescapable economics of tariffs - concentrated winners; diffuse losers - applies at the regional scale, too.<br> Universities are the quintessential anchor institutions - those trusty stalwarts of economic development that prime local innovation ecosystems, invest heavily in their communities, and serve as stable sources of good jobs. Yet universities must now contend with massive uncertainty around the fate of science and innovation-related funding administered by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies. Even seemingly arcane changes such as the proposed cap on the amount of facilities and administration costs the federal government will reimburse threaten to upend how the country finances its R&amp;D infrastructure.<br> Regarded from the bottom-up, anchor institutions are precious assets. They are key sources of the competitive advantage that local economic development so assiduously seeks to cultivate. Assets sometimes underperform, of course, and many regions likely share the White House’s desire to get more out of them: more research, more innovation, more startups - and all of it faster. Smart federal efforts to invest differently, revisit incentive structures, and shake up sclerotic bureaucracies would likely be welcomed. But invest less? Viewed from the bottom up, such a move serves no local purpose. In fact, it would be economic development malpractice.<br> The regional foundations of national prosperity<br> A cardinal rule of economic development is to build on strengths. Coming off an historic period of legislating, the Trump administration inherits the most robust federal economic development apparatus - the most flexible and innovative tools with the most substantial funding authorizations and most activated network of local partners - of any President in recent history. The industries of tomorrow will be forged in the places where workers, firms, and ideas come together. In his drive to transform the U.S. economy, the President should take a moment to study what makes its regional economic engines tick.<br> Kenan Fikri is a senior fellow at the Economic Innovation Group. Until recently, he served as the inaugural director of the Regional Economic Research Initiative at the U.S. Department of Commerce. He has nearly two decades experience in economic development and a masters degree in Local Economic Development from the London School of Economics.<br> (1) It’s a testament to the enduring economic logic of industry clusters that the same basic geographic configuration would reemerge overseas. Geographic specialization now underpins China’s industrial might, as its deep networks of suppliers and customers derive competitive advantage from specializing locally, too.<br> (2) The Recompete Pilot Program is another new competitive grant program authorized in the CHIPS and Science Act that speaks directly to Administration priorities: closing the prime-age employment gap in left-behind areas such as Eastern Kentucky or formerly industrial cities such as Allentown, PA.<br> (3) The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms program expired in July 2022 and is no longer accepting new applications for assistance; Economic Adjustment Assistance for regions is ongoing. It’s worth reflecting on the extent to which the China Shock itself might have been mitigated had the federal government identified and responded to the crisis with increased TAAF and EAA support in real time.<br> (4) This discussion has focused on EDA, but the principles apply across federal agencies supporting economic development and innovation. For example, there is no shortage of proposals to reform the National Science Foundation or the National Institutes of Health that would have a far more constructive impact on American innovation than dramatically curtailing their grantmaking or cutting their funding.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R226" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">227</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3706px;left:-1px">SAU KHI BỆNH UNG THƯ CỦA BIDEN ĐƯỢC CÔNG BỐ…<br> Tiết lộ của các thuộc hạ bắt đầu rò rỉ, rồi tuôn trào như tháo cống!

They cower in fear of this cantankerous man, but when they smell blood in the water, they spill all the details. Weeks after that debate implosion, which led to his booting from the Democratic ticket, the staff leaks were numerous and damning. <br> Now, with the prostate cancer diagnosis, an affliction that Joe was likely suffering for years, more aides are leaking details, from knowing that something else might be off besides his mental health to whether he took the Prostate-Specific Antigen test at all. They feared another cover-up was happening. No, it was happening, folks.<br> Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and brother of Rahm Emanuel, said that this stage four metastatic cancer doesn’t magically appear. It takes years; Biden likely had it at the start of his presidency. It wasn’t disclosed. <br> The question is whether this test was administered. You can’t just take the president’s blood. However, at Biden’s age, this screening is an annual chore. It likely would have shown elevated levels. The New York Post had numerous aides come forward, some of whom alluded that Biden’s doctor isn’t discreet, and a PSA test would’ve led to a paper trail that the White House didn’t want at the time. We have another cover-up. Yet, some ran interference for Biden’s doctor (via NY Post): <br>  “I just don’t know how they just, kind of find this out on a Friday, and it’s this far advanced and serious,” the Biden White House aide said. “[If it’s] in the bones, there’s gotta be a discomfort … I think they just didn’t test.” <br>  Another longtime aide to Biden questioned why his presidential physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, didn’t perform a Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test, one of the most common ways to screen for prostate cancer. <br>  The test was not mentioned on Biden’s February 2024 physical report, his last such exam while in office. <br>  “I think the likely scenario, knowing Kevin O’Connor pretty well, is that they had a discussion on what a PSA test is, and they decided not to do one because it would likely be elevated and cause a story, since a lot of older men have high PSAs that are false positives,” this source said. <br>  “A blood test has a paper trail. They probably just didn’t do the test. I think it would leak if he had a PSA test they tried to bury.” <br>  “What’s ironic,” this person added, “is that if they didn’t give the president a PSA test because of the potential for optics of a possible false positive, that decision is ultimately going to lead to his death because they could have caught it earlier.” <br>  […] <br>  Both of The Post’s sources said they had trouble believing that O’Connor - known as “Doc” - had diagnosed Biden’s cancer while he was in office or that the loyal physician, who also worked with Biden during his vice presidency, would have known about any symptoms. <br>  “Frankly, residence staff talk. It would have gotten out,” said the former White House staffer.<br>  “I just know Doc could not have lived with himself if he knew this was happening and he didn’t do everything he could. Also, Doc isn’t discreet. Yes, he’s a doctor, but he’s always chatting.” <br>  O’Connor was never allowed to brief the press on his annual assessments of Biden’s health. He gave a single interview to a news outlet, proclaiming the then-president’s health was ‘excellent” last July when a Post reporter spotted him on the White House driveway and filmed a Q&amp;A. <br> Sorry, the timelines don’t lie. Someone had to have known. And please, when Lady MacBeth issued an order, you bet it was followed. Cancer this advanced, and no one knew. It’s simply unbelievable. Also, given the length the Democrats and the media went to hide Biden’s mental health circus, which up until recently we thought was the worst of the scandal, the trust balance with this clown car is negative. We can’t trust anything the Biden team says because they’re bonafide liars. Also, with this development comes the 2022 slip-up that likely wasn&#39;t:<br> Knowingly keeping a sick, dementia-ridden man in the driver’s seat in a craven attempt to hold onto is unsurprising behavior exhibited by today’s Democratic Party. Also, Jill Biden, you allowed this to happen, didn’t you? You are an awful, miserable woman. <br> It’s also clear again that the Biden White House was clueless, which explains so much regarding the country&#39;s state once this crime lord left.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R227" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">228</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:8557px;left:-1px">ĐÀI LOAN TRONG CÕI BẤP BÊNH<br> Bài tiểu luận trên Foreign Affairs nêu ra những bất nhất của Hoa Kỳ trong đối sách về Đài Loan, trước sự hăm dọa của Trung Cộng.

U.S. strategy broadly revolves around deterring China from attacking Taiwan, and for the past three presidential administrations, it has consisted of three central components: increasing the ability of the United States and Taiwan to defend the island militarily; using diplomacy to signal U.S. resolve to protect Taiwan while also reassuring China that Washington does not support Taiwanese independence; and using economic pressure to slow China’s military modernization efforts.<br> But there is little consensus on the right balance among these three components - and that balance determines to some degree how deterrence looks in practice. Some contend that diplomatic pressure - along with military restraint, to avoid antagonizing China - will keep Beijing at bay. Others warn that unless Washington significantly strengthens its military posture in Asia, deterrence will collapse. And a third approach, outlined recently in Foreign Affairs by Jennifer Kavanagh and Stephen Wertheim, emphasizes that bolstering Taiwan’s self-defense and enabling offshore U.S. support is the best route to sustaining deterrence while also mitigating the risk of escalation.<br> These prescriptions have merit but fall short of grappling with the paradox at the heart of U.S. strategy: deterrence can fail in two ways. Do too little, and Beijing may gamble it can seize Taiwan before Washington is able to respond. Do too much, and Chinese leaders may conclude that force is the only remaining path to unification. Navigating this dilemma requires more than a stronger military or bolder diplomacy. It requires a calibrated strategy of rearmament, reassurance, and restraint that threads the needle between weakness and recklessness. Combined properly, forward-deployed capabilities, diplomatic restraint, and selective economic interdependence can reinforce one another to maintain credible deterrence while avoiding provocation.<br> So far, however, the Trump administration’s approach to Taiwan has veered between harsh transactionalism, such as the imposition of a 32 percent tariff on most Taiwanese goods last month, and quiet reaffirmations of support for Taipei through bipartisan visits and a pause on the highest tariffs. The administration still has time to settle on a coherent strategy, but the window of opportunity is closing.<br> LOOSE LIPS START WARS<br> Currently, the U.S. military is improving its force posture in the vicinity of Taiwan, most notably through expanded access to bases in the Philippines and by reinforcing capabilities in southwestern Japan and the broader western Pacific. In the Philippines, thanks to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, the United States gained access to four new strategic sites, bringing the total there to nine. Several, such as those in Cagayan and Isabela Provinces, are just a few hundred miles from Taiwan.<br> The story is similar in Japan’s case. Washington and Tokyo agreed in 2023 to restructure the U.S. Marine Corps presence in Okinawa from the artillery-focused 12th Marine Regiment, part of a force of roughly 18,000 marines stationed in Japan, into a 2,000-strong Marine Littoral Regiment, a quick-reaction force designed to operate along the so-called first island chain encompassing Indonesia, Japan, portions of the Philippines, and Taiwan. To complement this effort, the U.S. military has increased joint military exercises and expanded integrated air and missile defense systems across allied territories.<br> But U.S. military capabilities in the Pacific need more than just quantitative upgrades; they require qualitative shifts to be able to block China from forcibly unifying with Taiwan. The United States needs a greater forward presence in the region, as well as specific capabilities that would prevent an invading force from making its way across the Taiwan Strait, such as strategic bombers, submarines, and antiship missiles. Once those were deployed, they would also require significant operational flexibility. For example, Washington should prioritize securing forward-deployed submarine tenders in Japan and the Philippines to enable submarines to reload, resupply, and rearm without returning to Guam or Hawaii. And it should work to establish permanent bomber bases in Australia and the Philippines and deploy antiship missile systems in Japan’s southwestern islands and the northern Philippines.<br>  The trade war could make a shooting war seem more appealing to Beijing.<br> So far, the U.S. military has stopped short of seeking such changes because they are politically sensitive both at home and abroad: host countries worry they might become greater targets of Chinese aggression, and some U.S. policymakers worry that such moves could cross a redline for Beijing. But if Washington follows a few principles, such improvements will not necessarily provoke Chinese aggression. First, the United States should not make a public announcement or a spectacle of enhancements to its military force posture. As U.S. forces increase their activities around and in Taiwan, be they joint exercises, freedom of navigation exercises, or training, U.S. officials should refrain from making statements to which China might feel forced to respond. Military upgrades should be concealed or downplayed until they are fielded to minimize the likelihood that China will effectively launch a coercive campaign against their deployment.<br> Bolstering Taiwan’s independent military capabilities - a long-standing U.S. policy - presents an arguably even bigger risk of provocation. Beijing worries that Taiwan will become so certain of its ability to protect itself that it will consider declaring independence. In recent years, Taiwan has acquired defense capabilities with the aim of deterring potential Chinese aggression. It has bought asymmetric warfare systems, such as coastal defense cruise missiles and HIMARS rocket systems, moving away from traditional high-cost platforms such as submarines. It has also pledged that its defense budget will exceed three percent of GDP in 2025 and that it will prioritize precision-guided munitions, air defense upgrades, command-and-control systems, equipment for reserve forces, and anti-drone technologies. These are sensible steps, but they also pose a risk: the less Taiwan depends on U.S. assistance, the more China’s leaders worry that Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, could be emboldened to declare independence unilaterally - further incentivizing Beijing to invade sooner rather than later.<br> To prevent deterrence from morphing into provocation, the United States should provide Taiwan mainly with capabilities that rely on continued U.S. support. In 2024, for example, the Biden administration approved the sale of three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems to Taiwan in a deal that was brokered to increase U.S.-Taiwanese interoperability. In other words, this system was designed to function best in tandem with U.S. support. The United States should continue to encourage Taiwan’s asymmetric defense, particularly by prioritizing the speedy and reliable delivery of systems such as the highly mobile precision HIMARS rockets; advanced air defense missile systems such as the NASAMS; and antiship missiles such as the RGM-84L-4 Block II Harpoon. But Washington should also highlight the aspects of Taiwan’s military capacity that are linked to the United States, reassuring Beijing that the island cannot act alone.<br> WORDS AND DEEDS<br> Reassuring Beijing is a critical component of a successful deterrence strategy. But during both the Trump and the Biden administrations, the United States has relaxed its longstanding policy of “strategic ambiguity,” wherein U.S. policy has avoided defining whether and under what circumstances Washington would intervene to defend Taiwan. Instead, the United States has been signaling to China its determination to defend Taiwan - especially by making incremental moves toward establishing formal diplomatic relations with the island, such as direct interactions between American and Taiwanese officials.<br> Joe Biden was the first U.S. president to invite Taiwan’s diplomatic representatives to attend his inauguration, for example, and he repeatedly referred to a U.S. “commitment” to Taiwan’s defense, even saying once that U.S. forces would defend the island in the event of an “unprecedented attack.” (White House officials stated at the time that there was no change to the official policy of “strategic ambiguity.”) Officials in the second Trump administration, including Mike Waltz before he was ousted as national security adviser, have advocated ending strategic ambiguity and moving toward “strategic clarity.” And in February, the State Department removed a statement about not supporting Taiwan’s independence from its website - a deletion that China interpreted as provocative.<br> Although they may seem merely symbolic, such diplomatic slights have real consequences, making it harder for Beijing to maintain a veneer of progress toward unification of the mainland with Taiwan. Chinese leaders see any drift toward Taiwanese independence as a threat to their legitimacy. So, far from deterring Beijing, U.S. provocations - official diplomatic interactions, references to Taiwan as a country, calls for a U.S.-Taiwanese alliance - could incentivize Beijing to undertake a cross-strait invasion.<br> Reassurance that Washington does not support Taiwanese independence should include public criticism when Taiwan’s leaders make statements or take actions that suggest otherwise. For example, in December 2003, President George W. Bush publicly rebuked Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian during a joint press conference with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, stating that the United States opposed any “unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo,” noting that Chen’s “comments and actions” had indicated “that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change” it. In 2006, after Chen angered Beijing by scrapping a government council that had been established to guide unification with China, the Bush administration once again signaled its disapproval, denying the Taiwanese leader’s request for a high-profile U.S. stopover during a presidential trip to Latin America. These sorts of reassurances helped convince Chinese leaders that future “peaceful reunification” remained possible, reducing the likelihood of an invasion.<br> The United States should also keep trying to build a multilateral consensus for peace in the Taiwan Strait. For instance, joint statements issued at the G-7 summit last month and at the Munich Security Conference in February reaffirmed cross-strait stability and expressed opposition to any unilateral actions that threaten peace in the Taiwan Strait, including through force or coercion. Washington should pair these diplomatic signals with a clear reaffirmation that its “one China” policy remains in place, that any resolution must be nonviolent, and that the United States is not against peaceful unification with Taiwan’s assent.<br> FROM TRADE WAR TO SHOOTING WAR<br> These changes to military capabilities and to U.S. diplomacy are easy compared with what is required in the third area of U.S. deterrence strategy: economic pressure. Economic pressure can undermine deterrence and reassurance alike. Since the first Trump administration, the United States has pursued an economic containment strategy to slow China’s long-term growth and deny it advanced technologies, with the aim of hampering its capacity to match U.S. military investments. This began with the first Trump administration’s tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese goods. The Biden administration not only kept these tariffs in place but also added export controls on strategically important technologies, such as semiconductors and telecommunications. The United States also pressured American companies to shift their supply chains and manufacturing operations away from China.<br> The second Trump administration has threatened to accelerate an economic decoupling from China with even wider-ranging, unconditional tariffs, although the prospect of financial pain for the United States seems to have given it pause for now. Nonetheless, these policies portend lasting damage to the Chinese economy, especially in view of China’s looming demographic and environmental challenges. For Washington, the hope remains that Beijing may be unable to keep pace militarily as its relative growth rate slows.<br> But the ongoing U.S.-Chinese trade war and escalating American export and investment restrictions have deepened Beijing’s mistrust and reinforced its claim that Washington seeks containment rather than peaceful coexistence. This economic pressure not only risks hardening China’s resolve but also enables Beijing to recast itself as a defender of global trade norms and to shift blame for any global economic slowdown to the United States. At the same time, the United States risks forfeiting its long-term leverage, as the tariffs may goad Beijing to deepen its commitment to what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) calls “domestic demand expansion,” or selling more products at home instead of exporting them. Such a shift in China’s economy would encourage domestic production and innovation and accelerate efforts to reduce reliance on foreign markets.<br> This U.S. strategy will also have limited effects on China’s long-term military prowess. China has pursued military modernization at historically low costs, avoiding the classic “guns or butter” dilemma. China has not matched U.S. defense spending dollar for dollar, as challengers did in earlier great-power rivalries. Nazi Germany, for instance, spent twice as much on its military as the United Kingdom did between 1933 and 1939. And during the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet defense budgets signaled direct competition: the United States spent an average of 32 percent more than the Soviet Union until 1970, when the Soviet Union took the lead, outspending the U.S. by an average of 26 percent until 1988. In contrast, China has made targeted investments intended to give it an advantage in a quick, limited war, while keeping its overall defense spending relatively modest: Beijing’s defense spending has risen from five percent of U.S. levels in 1995 to 32 percent in 2017. In this way, China has sustained both economic development and military modernization, but avoided a Cold War­–style arms race. China will therefore be able to continue its military modernization program even with a stagnant economy, especially if it increases its military spending as a share of GDP.<br> Fighter jets on a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in the East China Sea, November 2024<br> Fighter jets on a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in the East China Sea, November 2024 Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters<br> Indeed, instead of hampering China’s military, the trade war could make a shooting war seem more appealing to Beijing. Currently Chinese leaders would consider an invasion of Taiwan only in a specific, narrow scenario: if China could take the island before U.S. forces could intervene. For Beijing, a larger-scale, protracted war would be too costly. This is partly because of the economic value of the U.S.-Chinese relationship. But if U.S. economic pressure increases, Chinese leaders could conclude that the benefits of continued economic engagement are low and that conflict with the United States is the only way to get out from under the American thumb. This would make them more willing to risk war over Taiwan.<br> Concrete economic and diplomatic concessions that increase China’s benefits from maintaining the status quo and credibly convey benign U.S. intent would be effective reassurances. Pausing or reversing the economic decoupling is an obvious place to start; Washington should rescind tariffs on Chinese imports (or at least make them conditional on reasonable Chinese reciprocation) and relax its restrictions on exports and on incoming investment in all but the most sensitive technologies and sectors. This would not only quell Beijing’s perception that the United States seeks to weaken and “split” China but also allay any brewing domestic instability that could threaten the CCP’s legitimacy and encourage Chinese leaders to forcibly take Taiwan to boost nationalist legitimacy. Perhaps most important, sustaining economic interdependence, especially the asymmetric sort that currently exists, gives the United States enormous leverage over China by allowing it to threaten heavier sanctions in the event of war. Unilateral U.S. sanctions could set the Chinese economy on a path of permanent decline. Pausing or circumscribing an economic decoupling would give U.S. sanctions maximum bite and bolster deterrence.<br> Of course, bolstering economic interdependence also requires limiting U.S. reliance on key Chinese imports, such as rare-earth minerals, transformers for the electric grid, scarce medicines, high-tech electronics, and other industrial, infrastructural, and military inputs. The United States should diversify its sources for these imports and reduce the proportion that China provides to acceptable levels. But Washington does not need to immediately reduce imports of Chinese consumer goods, even though substitutes can be found relatively easily. Allowing such imports to continue would enable the United States to avoid destabilizing China while retaining the threat of painful sanctions. Finally, to maximize its deterrent leverage against China, Washington should coordinate a sanctions coalition with allies, which may require offering them subsidies or other concessions.<br> For many in Washington, deterrence has come to mean projecting an uncompromising and even hostile posture toward China. But such gestures do not meaningfully augment Taiwan’s security. Instead, the United States should invest quietly in its military readiness and capabilities, speak carefully, and maintain economic resilience and even some interdependence. The dilemma of deterrence - the fact that it can so easily slide into provocation or procrastination - necessitates such a tightrope approach. And if there’s one place where striking the right balance could pay enormous dividends, it’s Taiwan.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R228" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">229</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3791px;left:-1px">ĐẢNG DÂN CHỦ VƯỢT LẰN RANH ĐỎ ĐỂ...

From Democratic members of Congress to judges to city council members, officials claim that their official duties include obstructing the official functions of the federal government. It is a type of liberal license that excuses most any crime in the name of combating what Minn. Gov. Tim Walz called the “modern-day Gestapo” of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).<br> The latest claimant of this license is Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), who was charged with assaulting, resisting, and impeding law enforcement officers during a protest at Delaney Hall ICE detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. McIver is shown on video forcing her way into an ICE facility and striking and shoving agents in her path.<br> This was not a major incursion, but these state and federal officials joined a mob in briefly overwhelming security and breaching the fence barrier after a bus was allowed through the entrance. Federal officials were able to quickly force back the incursion.<br> McIver and House Democrats insisted that McIver’s forcing her way into the facility might be trespass and assault for other citizens, but she was merely exercising “legislative oversight.” Rep. Alexandria Ocacio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) declared “You lay a finger on someone – on Bonnie Watson Coleman or any of the representatives that were there – you lay a finger on them, we’re going to have a problem.”<br> Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) even ominously warned the federal government that Democrats would bring down the house if it tried to charge McIver: “It’s a red line. They know better than to go down that road.”<br> Well, the red line was crossed in a big way after Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba charged McIver with a felony under Title 18, United States Code, Section 111(a)(1).<br> The ACLU called the charged “authoritarianism” and insisted that these state and federal politicians “have every right to exercise their legally authorized oversight responsibilities for expanded immigration detention in New Jersey.”<br> The problem with the oversight claim is that McIver’s status as a member of Congress does not allow her access into closed federal facilities. Congress can subpoena the Executive Branch or secure court orders for access. However, members do not have immunity from criminal laws in unilaterally forcing their way into any federal office or agency.<br> If that were the case, Rep. Alexandria Ocacio-Cortez would not have posted images of herself crying at the fence of an immigrant facility, she could have climbed over the fence in the name of oversight.<br> Conversely, Republicans in the Biden Administration could have simply pushed their way into the Justice Department to seek the files on the influence-peddling scandal.<br> Yet, the point of the claim is less of a real criminal defense and more of a political excuse.<br> It is the same claim being heard this week from Worcester City Councilor Etel Haxhiaj who was shown in a video shoving and obstructing ICE officers attempting to arrest a woman on immigration charges. Two other individuals (including a Democratic candidate for a school board) were arrested, but not Haxhiaj who claimed that she was merely protecting “a constituent.” After the melee, the city manager issued an order preventing city police from assisting in any way in the carrying out of such civil immigration enforcement efforts by the federal government.<br> Even judges are claiming the same license. In Wisconsin, Judge Hannah Dugan has been charged with obstructing a federal arrest of an illegal immigrant who appeared in her courtroom. Dugan heard about agents waiting outside in the hallway to arrest the man and went outside to confront the agents. She told them to speak to the Chief Judge and that they needed a different warrant.<br> The agents complied and the Chief Judge confirmed that they could conduct the arrest. In the interim, however, Dugan led the man out a non-public door and facilitated his escape (he was arrested after a chase down a public street).<br> Judge Duggan also claimed that she was carrying out her duties even though her hearing was over, the charges were not part of state matter, and the arrest was being carried out outside of her courtroom.<br> As Democratic leaders like Walz engage in rage rhetoric and paint Republicans (and federal law enforcement) as Nazis, political violence is on the rise across the country. Many of the people burning Teslas and engaging in such crimes claim the same type of license that the ends justify the means. That includes affluent professionals who are now shoplifting from Whole Foods as a “protest” against Jeff Bezos meeting with Trump.<br> When the Administration sought to investigate those burning Teslas and dealerships, Rep. Dan Goldman (D., N.Y.) denounced it as a “political weaponization” of the legal system. The comments suggest that such arson is somehow a form of political expression on the left.<br> House Minority Leader Jeffries was correct that a “red line” was crossed but not the one that he was thinking of in threatening consequences for any charges. The red line is the one separating political expression and criminal conduct.<br> Border Czar stressed repeatedly to political leaders that they can protest and refuse to help but “you can‘t cross the line” into obstruction and interference with their operations.<br> If oversight means that members can force their way into any federal facilities, we would have 535 roaming inspectors general who could wander at will through the executive branch.<br> Rep. McIver would be better to claim a different type of oversight, in allowing her passion to briefly overwhelm her judgment in rushing into the facility.<br> In the end, however, McIver and Duggan may have a license of a different kind.<br> Both have the advantage of being charged in liberal districts where they would appear before sympathetic jurors. They need to just convince a single jury to engage in “jury nullification,” to vote based on the cause, not the crime, in the case.<br> Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and the author of “The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage.”<br> This column appeared in the New York Post.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R229" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">230</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3333px;left:-1px">TRUMP VÀO QUỐC HỘI RĂN ĐE CÁC DÂN BIỂU CỘNG HÒA<br> Với đa số quá mỏng tại Hạ Viện, phe Cộng Hòa lại thiếu thống nhất về ưu tiên ngân sách khi phải kịp biểu quyết dự luật trước sự chống đối tron vẹn của phe Dân Chủ.

Photo: Ken Cedeno/Reuters<br> Key Points: - What&#39;s This?<br> * Trump pressured House Republicans to unite behind his budget reconciliation bill.<br> * The bill includes extending tax cuts, boosting border spending, and repealing climate tax credits.<br> * Factions are divided over Medicaid cuts and raising the cap on state and local tax deductions.<br> WASHINGTON — President Trump visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday to do what he does best: Use his bully pulpit to pressure unruly Republican lawmakers to get on board with his agenda.<br> In a closed-door meeting with the House Republican conference, the president urged fiscal conservatives to give up efforts to expand Medicaid cuts and moderates to drop their drive for further blue-state tax relief, pushing them to unite around his “one big beautiful” budget reconciliation bill, according to people familiar with his comments. <br> “Don’t f— around with Medicaid,” he said, according to attendees.<br> Trump’s visit comes at a high-stakes moment: House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) has said he wants to vote on the package as soon as Wednesday, with passage no later than the coming Memorial Day weekend. But party factions remained far apart on a series of sticking points.<br> The measure funds a series of the promises Trump made on the campaign trail including extending his 2017 tax cuts and making new ones, boosting border spending, repealing climate tax credits and more. <br> A senior White House official said Trump “made clear he’s losing patience with all holdout factions.” The president backs work requirements for Medicaid and exclusion of unauthorized immigrants, but doesn’t want additional changes, and further changes to SALT deductions can be tackled in a future bill, the official said. <br> House Republicans are racing to mend party divisions and pass President Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful” tax-and-spending bill. WSJ’s Olivia Beavers explains key disagreements within the party ahead of its Memorial Day deadline. Photo Illustration: Elise Dean<br> Heading into the meeting, the president warned of the consequences of failing to pass his bill, noting that taxes would rise for many American households should Congress fail to extend the tax provisions from his first term and that Republican holdouts could face primary challenges.<br> “What Republican would vote for that? Because they wouldn’t be a Republican much longer. They would be knocked out so fast.” Trump said to reporters before the meeting, arguing the party is united—except for “one or two grandstanders.” He took aim at one of the House Republicans expected to vote against the bill, saying Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.) should be “voted out of office.”<br> Rep. Michael Baumgartner (R., Wash.) compared the meeting to a locker room before a big football game. <br> Trump “told every Republican House member what play he is calling - put the bill on the floor, vote for it and score a touchdown for America,” Baumgartner said.<br> Republicans can afford to lose only a handful of votes in the House, where they have a 220-213 majority. Democrats are united in opposition, saying the proposal cuts Medicaid to fund tax cuts for the wealthy.<br> Trump is trying to close the deal amid continued grumbling from different wings of his party. <br> “It’s a deficit-spending bill. It actually grows the deficit this Congress,” said Rep. Warren Davidson (R., Ohio), a deficit hawk and Trump ally, who said ahead of the meeting that he was a “no” vote. Asked if Trump could say anything to get him to change his mind, Davidson said there has to be a “plan to actually cut spending.”<br> The bill would cut taxes by nearly $4 trillion, compared with doing nothing, while generating about $1.6 trillion in spending reductions and other deficit-reducing policies. <br> Some fiscal conservatives are seeking to enact deeper and faster changes to Medicaid, which serves 70 million low-income and disabled people, to limit the growth of the federal deficit. But centrists and other Republicans warn that further cuts would hurt the party’s chances of keeping the House majority in the midterm elections. On Sunday night, four conservative holdouts allowed the bill to proceed through the Budget Committee, but they said their concerns weren’t fully resolved.<br> TRUMP&#39;S TAX PLAN<br> Some members are pressing the idea of cutting back on the share the federal government contributes to Medicaid. Johnson has repeatedly taken that idea off the table, but spending hawks say it needs to be part of the mix, citing rising budget deficits and saying that the matching rate is unfair to states that declined to expand Medicaid to cover more low-income people, as permitted by the 2010 Affordable Care Act.<br> A day earlier, Johnson held a series of meetings with various factions. He met with the Republican Main Street Caucus, where people familiar with the meeting said he was in listening mode, making notes on a writing pad as his GOP members raised issues with Medicaid and energy tax issues, including about nuclear power.<br> Johnson then jetted to another meeting, largely composed of conservative House Freedom Caucus members and a group of centrists, where they tried to iron out various sticking points, according to people familiar with this meeting.<br> Johnson also met with the New York Republicans insisting on an increase in the SALT cap, seeking to nail down a deal with them. These SALT Republicans, however, were dismissive of the offer Johnson put forward. Rep. Mike Lawler of New York described the latest proposal as “insufficient,” while heading into the meeting with Trump. <br> Inside the room Tuesday, Trump pushed Republicans holding out for better terms on SALT to accept the latest offer from Johnson, according to people in the room. The initial GOP proposal called for raising the cap to $30,000 from $10,000, and Johnson made another proposal on Monday night. Trump called out Lawler specifically on the matter, the people said. <br> Some centrists felt conservatives were hurting the deal they felt they made when it came to Medicaid.<br> “We negotiated in good faith, in the committees - won some, lost some, and the committee votes it out. And then these guys want to undo it,” said Rep. Don Bacon (R., Neb.), one of the three Republicans who represents a district won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. “I thought we found a good compromise.”</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R230" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">231</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:6065px;left:-1px">TÂM SỰ CỦA NGƯỜI GÀN!<br> Hôm nay, Sharyl Attkisson đi bài phỏng vấn dân biểu Cộng Hòa Thomas Massie của tiểu bang Kentucky.

His no-nonsense libertarian flair has made him a Kentucky fan favorite since 2012 where he’s racked up landslides past 80 percent at the polls. He may be Mr. Popular at home, but in DC he’s dubbed Mr. No. And his contrarian ways have put him in President Trump’s crosshairs. Today, he’s holding nothing back - calling out his overspending colleagues and the corrupting ways of the swamp.<br> The following is a transcript of a report from “Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson.”<br> Watch the video by clicking the link at the end of the page.<br> Rep. Thomas Massie: I think the uniparty here is on the same path they were on before President Trump was elected.<br> Republican Thomas Massie frequently says the quiet part out loud.<br> Massie (May 1, 2024): It is because Mike Johnson was doing Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden’s bidding.<br> Even when it’s talking out of school about fellow Republicans, their House leader Mike Johnson, the Trump agenda, and The Swamp.<br> Massie: That’s the real untold story here. And I think we may be on a collision course, like I think there’s three cars coming together at an intersection and they don’t realize they’re gonna hit. And one of them is Congress with Mike Johnson driving, is in one of these cars. Trump obviously is one of these cars. Maybe he’s the train. And then there’s another car, which is DOGE. And I don’t think Elon Musk is gonna suffer these fools once he finds out how foolish they are or duplicitous they are. You don’t land rockets backwards, you don’t get cars to drive themselves on the interstate, by ignoring the fools that you’re working with.<br> Sharyl: What fools are you referring to?<br> Massie: Mike Johnson.<br> Sharyl: Because?<br> Massie: He’s the leader of the fools. I mean we can just - anybody following him now as a fool as well.<br> Sharyl: Because?<br> Massie: Because.<br> Sharyl: The spending primarily? Or?<br> Massie: It’s a suicide pact to, to suspend us into oblivion.<br> A fiscal hawk and MIT-educated engineer, Massie’s record in Congress is a highlight reel of lone dissent. He even wears his obsession on his sleeve, actually his lapel, sporting a mini-debt clock he designed, ticking up the nation’s $36 trillion tab in real time.<br> In 2020, he infuriated both parties by forcing lawmakers back to D.C. for an in person vote by name on a $2.2 trillion Covid relief bill he saw as fiscally reckless.<br> Massie (March 27, 2020): Mr. Speaker I came here to make sure our republic doesn’t die by unanimous consent and empty chamber and I request a recorded vote.<br> In 2022, he was the only House member to reject a resolution against antisemitism. He argued it threatened free speech. He’s continued taking solo stances this year.<br> Massie: Well, I’ve stood alone three times so far in three months. I was the only dissenting Republican on making Mike Johnson the speaker. I was the only dissenting Republican on our budget. And I was the lone dissenting Republican on the continuing resolution, which is a cut copy paste of Biden’s last 15 months in office, which is going to do the same thing for the first nine months of Trump’s administration.<br> He calls colleagues two-faced on Trump’s government-shrinking agenda - like plans to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development or USAID.<br> Massie: There are Republicans, for instance, that want that USAID money. I mean there was a surreal moment for me at the State of the Union when Trump talked about cutting all these DOGE things that they had discovered. And my colleagues all stood up and cheered. And I’m like, ‘You are the ones who funded all of this’. Like DOGE is cutting the things that you all did and now you’re applauding. And Elon Musk is at odds with a lot of those Republicans who stood up and clapped. But they’re playing along with it right now, and they’re gonna do sort of a, I would call it Rope a Dope maybe to use a Kentucky boxer analogy here. They’re just letting Elon wear himself out.<br> Massie is also a standout for rejecting what he sees as the corrupting cash grab in Congress. Both parties push members to hit fundraising quotas in order to get rewarded with prime spots on committees. Then they use those roles to rake in donations from the very industries they oversee - blurring ethical lines.<br> Sharyl: Wait, you’re describing a relationship where you have to raise money for yourself or for the party..<br> Massie: For the party<br> Sharyl: to get a good position on a committee?<br> Massie: To get a good committee. This is why I’ll never be on what’s called an ‘A’ committee. Those committees are like Financial Services, Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce. Energy and Commerce by the way, regulates the pharmaceutical companies.<br> Sharyl: Because then when you’re on the important committee, you’ll do the lobbyists’ bidding or whatever they prefer, theoretically?<br> Massie: Yeah, if you find that somebody is on a committee that oversees the pharmaceutical companies, you’re gonna see - that’s who the pharmaceutical companies donate to. But you’re told before you get on the committee, “Don’t even ask for one of these ‘A’ committees unless you’re ready to do the hard work ‘across the street’.” ’Across the street’ means you can’t call up and ask for money here in this building we’re in right now, you have to walk across the street to the NRCC and make those phone calls. So they’ll tell you ‘unless you’re ready to do the hard work across the street, don’t ask for one of these committees.’<br> Sharyl: I hear they have like a board up that tells how much, who’s raised how much and what they’re supposed to raise?<br> Massie: It’s the Wall of Shame. So there’s a board that shows what your quota is based on your committee assignment. So if you’re on a lesser committee, you may only have to raise $300,000 every election cycle. But if you’re wanna win these bigger committees, it’s more like a million dollars or half a million dollars you need to raise and give to the party to stay in their good graces. If you look on the wall of shame, I’m at zero.<br> Sharyl: No ‘Dialing for Dollars’ for you?<br> Massie: I haven’t done it. I’ve not done it. I do, by the way, I do help the party. I do give money to candidates who are running in close elections, who have what I believe are sound principles. So I will help them in that way. I’ll go to the fundraisers and help ’em raise money, but I just don’t agree with the sort of extortion that goes on with these committee assignments<br> Massie’s relationship with Trump is a Capitol Hill soap opera. In 2020, Trump branded him a ‘third rate grandstander’ and tried to oust him over forcing the in-person Covid vote, but later endorsed Massie for re-election. Massie endorsed Ron DeSantis in 2024 then switched to Trump.<br> Massie: I’ve had three conversations or interactions with the president in the last nine months. One: He called and left condolences for my loss of my wife, which was very kind. I think it’s part of the president a lot of people don’t see. He didn’t need to do that. It didn’t gain him anything politically. But he took time out of his day to call me and offer his condolences. And then I talked to him about two weeks before the election about endorsing him, which I ultimately did that same day. And I initiated that phone call and he took my call on the second ring. And then I talked to him two weeks after the election, roughly about cabinet secretaries. There was discussion and, RFK Jr was a big fan of this, and the people that are supporting him was, hoped to see me be Ag secretary. And I would’ve done it, it’s not my life ambition, I think I could do a good job of it, but I spoke to Trump about that as well.<br> Sharyl: So you didn’t get picked for that - I didn’t know you were even considered.<br> Massie: Maybe I was, maybe I wasn’t. I don’t know. But three great positive interactions.<br> That was before Massie’s was the sole GOP “no” vote on two important Trump-backed bills that passed anyway: one on the budget, another a spending bill that avoided a government shutdown. He said both were fiscally irresponsible.<br> Trump lashed out on Truth Social, branding Massie a “GRANDSTANDER” and vowing to “lead the charge” to get him defeated in his next election.<br> Massie: This is deja vu. He’s called me a ‘grandstander’ again. But this time he didn’t qualify it as ‘third rate.’ So I think I’m moving up in the world. But what people know about me is if you attack me, I’m probably gonna dig in. You’re not gonna move me. I’m not bullied. I have no hard feelings toward the president. Sometimes he’s a bull in a China shop, and if a few of my dishes get broken, I’m okay.<br> Sharyl: Do you think that’s more about swampy people around him trying to have his ear about you?<br> Massie: Oh, I absolutely do. I think people were whispering in his ear, ‘You need to do something, Mr. President.’ That day, or about a day before that attack, I had come out against getting involved in a war with Iran. And I think there are people in and around the administration who are whispering in his ear, you know, ‘You need to whack this guy. He’s feeling his oats here and talking about not having a war and not getting involved in the Middle East and give him a dose of medicine.’ The tune-up doesn’t work on me. I think it’s performative to influence other members of Congress who might not be able to weather this. I joke that I’ve got Trump antibodies from a natural infection in 2020. This was my booster.<br> Sharyl (on-camera): For more on this story, listen to my podcast Full Measure After Hours.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R231" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">232</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:6693px;left:-1px">LÁ THƯ CẢM ĐỘNG CỦA HAI HỌC GIẢ GỬI CHO TRUMP<br> Họ quá lương thiện và kính trọng chức vụ Tổng thống nên thiếu lời nịnh hót.

(Photo by Atta Kenare/AFP via Getty Images)<br> ***<br> Dear Mr. President,<br> You are about to make a decision for which you will be remembered by history. Your legacy will either be as a world leader who saved, or failed to save, many lives. The decision concerns Iran&#39;s intention to develop a nuclear arsenal. There can be no reasonable doubt that Iran&#39;s mullahs are determined to obtain nuclear weapons, despite their assurances to the contrary. Nor can Israel, which is the intended target of an Iranian bomb, be expected to rely on deterrence or containment. Iran must be prevented from achieving their dangerous goal.<br> Obviously it would be better if the mullahs could be stopped by negotiation rather than military action. Previous negotiations resulted in a terrible deal under President Barack Obama. You yourself understood that under the Obama deal, Iran would almost certainly have obtained a nuclear arsenal, and so you quite correctly withdrew from the agreement. Now there are rumors that your administration is working on a &quot;better&quot; deal – longer and stronger. But unless your deal includes the complete and total destruction of all Iranian nuclear facilities, there will be no guarantee that its scientists could not surreptitiously use civilian nuclear infrastructure to build military weaponry. The only deal that would prevent this catastrophe would be one modeled on the agreement made with Libya made back in 2003. That deal completely dismantled Libya&#39;s nuclear facilities and made it impossible for them to weaponize nuclear energy infrastructure. Anything short of that will create an unacceptable risk.<br> We urge you to use your incredible negotiating skills to achieve the goal that you have set out: namely a 100% certainty that Iran will never get a nuclear bomb. You should give the mullahs a short period of time to dismantle and destroy, subject to American inspection, their entire nuclear program. If they refuse or fail to do so, the military option should be deployed.<br> Nearly a century ago, the British and French governments faced a similar decision with Germany, and they failed, costing tens of millions of lives.<br> A military attack on Germany in the mid-1930s, when its war machine was still weak, might have saved many of these lives. Here is what Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote in his memoir:<br>  &quot;In 1933 a French premier ought to have said (and if I had been the French premier, I would have said it): &#39;The new Reich chancellor is the man who wrote Mein Kampf, which says this and that. This man cannot be tolerated in our vicinity. Either he disappears or we March!&#39; But they didn&#39;t do it. They left us alone and let us slip through the risky zone, and we were able to sail around all dangerous reefs. And when we were done, and well armed, better than they, then they started the war!&quot;<br> The rest is tragic history. Germany built up its armed forces without countermeasures by its intended enemies, conquered most of Western Europe and killed millions of people. Most of those deaths could certainly have been avoided had Great Britain and France engaged in preventive military action before Germany became &quot;well armed&quot; and capable of inflicting so much damage on the world.<br> At the moment in history when Great Britain and France could have prevented the horrendous harm done by Nazi Germany, there was no way of knowing in advance the extent of what Adolf Hitler would do.<br> Yes, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, but many would-be conquerors do not follow through on their threats. (Recall the threat of the Soviet Union&#39;s Premier Nikita Khrushchev to &quot;bury&quot; the United States, yet he backed away from a nuclear confrontation over Cuba.)<br> There was no way of predicting, with any degree of certainty that Hitler would turn his belligerent rhetoric into military invasions of Poland, Europe and then the Soviet Union - and ultimately the Holocaust. It was, as it always is, a question of cost-benefit probabilities. This was a classic case of a false negative: implicitly predicting that Hitler would not do what, in fact, he did, and failing to take action in an effort to prevent it. If France and Great Britain had accurately predicted Hitler&#39;s actual harm correctly, they would almost certainly have taken preventive military action even if the cost were high – because it would never have been nearly as high as it turned out to be in the absence of such action.<br> But history is blind to the predictive future. Had Great Britain and France engaged in preventive military action in the 1930s that resulted in the deaths of, say, 15,000 British and French soldiers and civilians, the leaders who undertook such a military campaign would have been condemned as warmongers, because no one would ever know how many deaths they prevented by the sacrifice of those 15,000 lives. Ignorance of the hypothetical future is often the reason for failure to act in the present. That is the dilemma of failing to take preventive military action.<br> Mr. President, we are once again at a decisive decision point. And you are the decider. We urge you to do the right thing: take the necessary actions that will assure, with absolute certainty, that Iran will never obtain a nuclear arsenal, even if the only way to secure that certainly ends up being through military action.<br> ___<br> (Alan M.

Photo: Christopher Pike/Bloomberg News<br> Key Points - What&#39;s This?<br> * Elon Musk plans to reduce his political spending, stating he believes he has done enough.<br> * Musk previously spent a considerable fortune helping to elect President Trump in 2024.<br> * Musk indicated he might increase spending again if conditions change, but currently sees no reason.<br> Elon Musk says he plans to cut back on political spending, after making huge donations in the 2024 election to boost President Trump.<br> “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” he said in a video interview at the Qatar Economic Forum. “I think I’ve done enough.” <br> Musk, the world’s richest person, who according to filings spent close to $300 million in 2024 to help Trump and other Republicans, indicated he still could increase spending again if conditions change.<br> “If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,” he said. “I do not currently see a reason.”<br> Musk played a polarizing role in the early weeks of the Trump administration, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency as it slashed federal spending and jobs.<br> In April, Musk said he was going to spend less time in Washington and more overseeing Tesla, his electric-vehicle company. Investors had grown worried that he had taken his eye off the ball, with Tesla’s sales and share price dropping during his time in the White House.<br> On Tuesday, asked if he would still be chief executive of Tesla in five years, Musk said, “Yes.” He then added a caveat, saying, “Well, I might die.”<br> President Trump said last month that he would like to keep Elon Musk “for a long time” after the billionaire announced he would devote less hours to the Department of Government Efficiency. Photo: Mandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images<br> The Wall Street Journal recently reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that Tesla board members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Tesla’s next CEO. The board members, concerned that Musk was spending too much time in Washington, told him he needed to spend more time on Tesla. <br> Tesla later issued a denial and Musk criticized the article on X, his social-media platform.<br> Musk shrugged off declining Tesla sales - deliveries fell 13% in the first three months of the year compared with a year earlier - saying that while the company had lost some liberal customers over his prominent role in the Trump administration, it had gained others among his political supporters.<br> “Our sales are doing well at this point,” he said. “It’s already turned around.”<br> Last month when Tesla reported first-quarter earnings, the electric-vehicle maker’s net income fell by 71%, in part, on weaker demand. <br> In an interview on CNBC later Tuesday, Musk said Tesla was “seeing a major rebound in demand” and brushed off concerns about consumer reaction to his political activities. “When you buy a product, I mean how much do you care about the political views of the CEO?” <br> Musk also said that he expected a handful of autonomous robotaxis would be on roads in Austin, Texas, by the end of June. From there, Tesla will expand to other cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles. He predicted by year’s end there will be hundreds of thousands of self-driving Teslas in the U.S., though not specifically robotaxis. <br> After initially planning to stay out of the 2024 election, Musk became one of the largest individual donors in U.S. election history. Musk then turned his sights to the state level, pouring more than $23 million into a Wisconsin state Supreme Court race in April to boost a Republican-backed candidate. But the effort resulted in a loss - the liberal candidate won.<br> Musk dismissed potential conflicts of interest in his role as a top adviser to Trump and his extensive business interests, which include SpaceX, a leading commercial space-exploration company and government contractor, and xAI, an artificial-intelligence startup.<br> “I have not seen any case where there has been an accusation of conflict,” he said, adding that his work is only advisory - leaving it up to others in the administration to choose whether to enact his suggested cuts. <br> When asked on Tuesday about the Journal’s reporting last year that Musk had been in regular contact with Vladimir Putin since late 2022, Musk said he spoke to the Russian president once. “The reported conversations are false.”<br> Write to Eliot Brown at Eliot.Brown@wsj.com and Tali Arbel at tali.arbel@wsj.com</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R233" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">234</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:5143px;left:-1px">OVER MY SHOULDER CỦA MAULDIN ECONOMICS<br> Hôm nay, trong tiết mục này, Patrick Watson giới thiệu phúc trình rất hay của Gavekal nhằm nêu ra một số yếu tố dự báo tương lai giữa hai kịch bản là giảm thuế (qua dự luật ngân sách liên bang) hay tăng thuế nhập nội (tariff theo sáng kiến của Trump).

Gavekal’s Will Denyer and Tan Kai Xian examine the possible scenarios.<br> Key Points:<br> * Other things being equal, higher tariff revenue will help reduce the federal deficit.<br> * Congress seems likely to raise the deficit with tax cuts that outweigh spending cuts.<br> * The key question is whether tariff revenue will rise enough to offset the other fiscal expansion.<br> * Net deficit contraction would likely be negative for US equities.<br> * The more likely scenario, an expanded budget deficit only partially offset by tariff revenue, would be positive for growth, US equities and the US dollar, and negative for Treasury bonds.<br> * The risk is that upward pressure on yields could morph into a market panic, driven by foreign investor selling.<br> * Bottom Line: An uncomfortable reality is the stock market likes deficit spending, at least in the short run, since most of the money becomes revenue for US businesses. This is why serious attempts to balance the budget are usually bearish for stocks. But so are the higher bond rates that a rising debt may produce. There’s no easy way out of the box we are in.<br> - Patrick Watson<br> __<br> RẤT NÊN ĐỌC NGUYÊN BẢN CỦA GAVEKAL:<br> Tax Cuts vs. Tariff Hikes - bY Will Denyer, Tan Kai Xian | May 20, 2025 <br> US equities and treasuries brushed off Moody’s rating downgrade of US sovereign debt as old news and inconsequential. Its stripping of the US government’s AAA “risk free” rating comes two years after Fitch and 14 years after S&amp;P did the same. It does not matter since all three rating agencies still classify US debt as investment grade, meaning there will be no wave of forced sales to meet regulations or fund mandates. What does matter for investors <br> is how negotiations over the domestic budget and, separately, import tariffs play out - and their effect on US budget deficits. <br> Anything is possible on both fronts, as the domestic budget is still being negotiated by Congress, while import tariff rates are still being negotiated between the Trump administration and foreign trade partners. But we can consider possible scenarios, assess <br> which seems most probable, and consider the market consequences. <br> First, a few simplifying assumptions. For now, we ignore government spending cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, assuming they will be a rounding error as a factor <br> driving the US’s fiscal outlook in the next decade. There have always been good reasons to be skeptical that DOGE will significantly move the needle on deficits in the current context <br> (see DOGE Versus Reality). And thus far, there is no verifiable evidence that DOGE is having a large and lasting impact on federal spending. <br> The second simplifying assumption is that US GDP growth will average something close to its structural rate of 2%, as assumed by most professional forecasters. Of course, this will be wrong to some degree: US tax cuts and deregulation could boost growth, while tariffs, stricter immigration and policy uncertainty could detract from it. For now, we assume these positives and negatives will roughly net out over the next decade. Finally, we assume all policy changes are “permanent”. Of course, tariffs, domestic taxes and spending plans can - and will - change over the next 10 years, but we do not want to get confused by Congressional gimmicks, such as sunsetting tax cuts to reduce long-term cost estimates, knowing these cuts are likely to be extended. <br> While the situation is fluid, increased tariffs will contract the deficits, while it seems likely that Congress will increase deficits. It is just a question of how much, for both. This leaves us with two probable scenarios: <br> 1. Trump’s tariffs contract the deficit more than domestic tax cuts increase it. <br> 2. Domestic tax cuts expand the deficit more than tariffs contract it. <br> What would be the market consequences of these two scenarios? <br> The first scenario - in which increased tariff revenues outweigh domestic tax cuts resulting in a net deficit contraction - would likely be negative for US equities. Some of the burden from higher tariffs would be borne by US firms and a net contraction in deficits would <br> probably constrain US growth - which, in turn, would weigh on the US dollar. The impact on US treasuries is less clear. Slower growth and debt issuance could support treasuries, but with tariffs being the primary driver of the contraction, the dominant effect may be reduced foreign demand for US government paper, potentially weighing on its price. <br> The second scenario - in which the domestic budget expands deficits, and this is only partially offset by tariffs - should be positive for growth, US equities, and the dollar. At least that would be a normal market reaction to deficit expansion. It would also likely be negative for treasury bonds - on stronger growth and more issuance. The risk in this scenario is that upward pressure on yields due to an expansionary budget morphs into a market panic <br> driven by foreign investor selling (see The Meaning Of The Dollar Rout and Investing After Exceptionalism). This would be akin to the reaction seen in the UK in 2022 after the government announced unfunded tax cuts (see Trump Risks More Liz Truss Moments). <br> Both scenarios are possible, but the second one is more likely. While the tariff situation is fluid, it seems they will settle somewhere between the April 2 reciprocal rates (call it a worst-case scenario) and current rates (which is probably fairly close to a best-case <br> scenario, with most countries already at the new baseline of 10%, though there is room for improvement if the fentanyl-related tariffs on China are dropped). The Yale Budget Lab estimates that if all new tariffs imposed in 2025 were made permanent at current rates, the US government would raise roughly US$2.3trn over 10 years, including dynamic effects that change economic behavior. If negotiations go poorly and tariffs revert to April 2 rates, this <br> would increase revenues by an estimated US$2.5trn over 10 years - again accounting for dynamic revenue effects. For now, it seems reasonable to expect tariffs to increase revenues by around US$2.3-2.5trn over the coming decade. <br> Turning to the budget. The CBO currently estimates, before incorporating new tariffs or budget changes, that US budget deficits will remain roughly flat at around 6% of GDP for the next 10 years, with only a decline to around 5% in the coming few years due to the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts, which is thereafter reversed due to rising interest costs. For simplicity, think of the current baseline impact on budget deficits, on a 10-year horizon, as <br> roughly flat. <br> [Quan trọng:] As noted, tariffs will contract deficits. Domestic tax cuts will increase them. Will the domestic budget increase deficits by more than US$2.5trn over 10 years? Quite likely. <br> It is possible that deficits contract in the current year, due to increased tariff revenues and before some of the new tax cuts go into effect. That could provide a temporary drag on growth, but in this piece we are focused primarily on the long-term fiscal outlook and will do a more careful analysis of the very near term after we get more details. <br> The independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that if all temporary provisions in the latest House budget draft were made permanent they would add US$5.2trn to deficits in the next 10 years. Fiscal hawks in the House want more <br> spending cuts, but some Republicans from high-tax states want to lift the deduction for state and local taxes further - which would further crimp the Federal tax take. The Senate <br> also tends to favor less spending cuts, and more deficits. We will have to monitor how talks proceed, but for now, the second scenario - of expanding deficits - seems the more likely long-term US fiscal outlook.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R234" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">235</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3133px;left:-1px">KHÔNG CHỈ VIẾT BÌNH LUẬN, LÀM BÁO CŨNG CẦN TRÍ NHỚ….<br> Nhờ đó sẽ cười ha hả khi đọc trên To The Point tin tức và hình ảnh lãnh tụ Cu Ba Cu Bốn lù lù trong cõi âm mà… chết không được! <br> Bao giờ sẽ tới Putin khi cánh tả tại Mỹ vẫn chưa thổ tả và đòi (như ghi tên tờ NY Times) “we do the thinking for you”? <br> Đọc đến đây lại cười phá: trí thức cánh tả của Mỹ đúng là chồn cáo, chỉ biết giật lùi!

A little over three weeks before (November 😎, Donald Trump stunned the world being elected President, and now the Babylon Bee couldn’t help celebrating both that and Castro croaking on November 25. For me, it was an opportunity to discuss why those on the Left so often have a compulsion to worship the worst of humanity rather than the finest.]<br> It was the summer of 1992. Our youngest son, Jackson, had been born in May, and I was staying put, not traveling anywhere to remain at home to help Rebel take care of him.<br> A friend of mine named Ray Kline called. Ray was a legendary intel guy in Washington, having been the Deputy Director of the CIA under John Kennedy, and later Director of the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency at the Pentagon).<br> It was Ray Kline who, in the fall of 1962, drove down the George Washington Parkway from Langley CIA headquarters to the White House, entered the Oval Office, and placed the satellite photos of the Soviet missile emplacements in Cuba on Kennedy’s desk to personally explain them to the President of the United States.<br> That’s how the Cuban Missile Crisis began.<br> Ray was calling to tell me about a 30th anniversary conference of the veterans of the Crisis he had just come back from. The conference was in Havana, Cuba.<br> “You went to Cuba, Ray?” I asked, amazed. “Jack, the Soviet Union has vanished off the map [December 1991] and a lot of Castro’s people are nervous” he replied. “They are trying to convince him to make his peace with the US. They even asked me if I knew of a conservative organization that would send a delegation to Havana and talk to them.”<br> Ray paused for effect. “I suggested you and your Freedom Research Foundation.”<br> “You’ve got to be kidding, Ray,” was all I could say.<br> “Jack, Cuban intel knows all about how you instigated the Reagan Doctrine, which is why they no longer have their Soviet patron. Who better than you to go and see if they are for real?”<br> I told him I would think about it. I decided to go and told Rebel, my reason: “I want to look Fidel Castro in the eye and tell him that someday the Cuban people will urinate on his grave.”<br> She decided to go with me – in order to prevent me from doing any such thing.<br> Thus it was in October of 1992, with my Mom looking after little Jackson, that Rebel, our oldest son Brandon (just turned 😎, a group of donors to the Freedom Research Foundation, and I went to Cuba.<br> Most countries run by a dictator are ubiquitously festooned with pictures of their Dear Leader - like Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe or North Korea with the Kims.<br> So the very first thing I noticed in Cuba is that Castro was invisible: No pictures, statues, huge posters or other depictions of him anywhere. There were only billboards and signs with the Slogan of the Revolution: Socialismo o Muerte – Socialism or Death.<br> Not once did I see the rebellious defacement the sign was begging for: the “o” scratched out and replaced with “es” – Socialism is Death.<br> Walking down a street in Havana, Rebel and I came upon a middle-aged man engaged in make-shift repairs on his bicycle. Fluent in Spanish, Rebel struck up a conversation with him. I noticed the bike was made in China and had a label in English: “Forever.”<br> When Rebel asked him about his bike, he said it was no good. Trying to make our talk light-hearted, I said, “Tell him the bike is called Forever.” Rebel translated his reply: “Nothing is forever.”<br> I couldn’t help myself. Instantly I said, “Like Fidel Castro.”<br> When the man heard Rebel say this in Spanish, he was not startled nor fearful. Instead his eyes went blank, glazed over with utter incomprehension. He simply could not conceive of a Cuba without Castro.<br> The Castros rule through a secret police and informer network who are everywhere and look like everyone else – the “government in the crowd.” But at this moment, there was no one nearby who could overhear our conversation. And there didn’t need to be.<br> Castro rule and constant presence have been internalized by Cubans. Their lives have been controlled for so many years, he has turned them into a nation of obedient robots.<br> You could see it in this man’s eyes, in the eyes of the Cuban people in general. The lights are on, but nobody is home. They have checked out.<br> Last Friday (11/25) at age 90, Fidel Castro finally croaked. Cuban-Americans danced in the streets of Miami. Liberals mourned. A mystery that has puzzled me for almost 60 years rose again to confront me.<br> When I was 14 years old in 1958, my father was able to take my family to Moscow on a filming assignment. Our Intourist guide was named Valya. She took us to Red Square where I was entranced by the fabulous St. Basil’s Cathedral built 400 years ago by Russia’s first Czar, Ivan the Terrible (1530-1584), and named after an eccentric Russian saint known as Basil the Blessed (1468-1552).<br> Then we went to Lenin’s Tomb.<br> On the Kremlin side of Red Square, it housed the waxy embalmed corpse of the Soviet Union’s founder, Vladimir Lenin, who died in 1924 – and that of Joseph Stalin as well, who had died just a few years ago in 1953. (Stalin’s corpse was removed from Lenin’s tomb on the order of Nikita Khrushchev in 1961, and buried some 300 feet away under the Kremlin wall.)<br> A huge line of Russians, hundreds of people, waited their turn to enter and see the corpses encased in glass displays.<br> Valya took us to the front of the line, as we were “foreign guests.” Everyone from the guards to the people in line to Valya were so reverential, as if this were a holy, sacred place. There was complete silence as we entered the tomb with a number of Russians and proceeded past the two bodies under glass, nobody making the slightest sound. It was impossibly creepy.<br> It was also hard for me not to laugh. All over Moscow we had seen huge statues of Lenin and Stalin, making them look like giants towering above the rest of us mere pygmies. Yet I had learned in the research I’d done back home that they were not much taller than midgets – Lenin was five-foot-one, while Stalin was under five-four[i].<br> What really got to me was all the pretending that these two monsters were moral giants. What would the world think of Germans flocking to the tomb of Hitler, with Hitler’s body on display under glass and worshipped?<br> I was only 14, yet I knew that these men had murdered millions, that they were among the most evil men who had ever lived, that they were moral equivalents of Hitler. The reverential silence, the worship of evil, displayed by these Russians all around me as we slowly shuffled past their corpses was terrifying and mysterious. Suddenly, I didn’t want to laugh.<br> When we came out again onto Red Square, I felt overwhelmed by a question: Why would people worship evil?<br> Why would they worship monsters as heroes, monsters who took away their freedom, who slaughtered and starved them, put them in concentration camps, caused them to live a life of fear?<br> The question puzzles me to this day. I saw one answer in the eyes of Cubans in Havana: helplessness.<br> When people feel helpless, they submit. An old aphorism explains this exactly: “When you have a man by the balls, his heart and mind will follow.”<br> But… why do Russians today, 25 years after the extinction of the Soviet Union, continue to line up in droves every day to pay Zombie Reverence to the monster in Lenin’s Tomb?<br> Why do they continue to worship evil when they are under no compulsion to do so?<br> Even more puzzling is affluent and free liberals in America worshipping evil.<br> It’s no puzzle seeing many of the world’s fascist scumbags show up to pay homage to their dead hero in Havana. But why does the BBC or USA Today headline them as “World Leaders”?<br> Why would NBC’s Andrea Mitchell be in tears over her “revered” Castro’s death, or ABC’s Jim Avila compare him to George Washington? Why did so much of the US media have a love affair with Castro for more than a half-century?<br> Not all liberals worship evil. In Richard Cohen’s On The Left column yesterday (11/29), he condemned Obama’s citing “the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation.” Cohen’s acid retort:<br>  “If individual lives were altered by torture, imprisonment, execution or mere harassment then I suppose the president is on to something and once again using language creatively. But this is thin gruel for Castro’s victims, some of whom might have expected the president of the United States to acknowledge their suffering. Alas, they got nothing.”<br> In the Washington Post (11/26), Dr. Carlos Eire, Riggs Professor of History at Yale University denounced the “Kafkaesque moral disequilibrium” affecting so many of his academic colleagues regarding Castro, listing 13 of his horrors that should be etched onto his tombstone.<br> They are the exceptions that “proves” (meaning “tests”) the rule of liberals rooting for America’s enemies. That’s virtually a defining characteristic of liberals – to be so embarrassed over America’s success in world history that they are on the side of anyone anti-American no matter how evil.<br> The good news is that very soon we will no longer have a liberal embarrassed-to-be-American president, and instead have a president who will make liberals everywhere, from the media to academia to Hollywood, irrelevant.<br> Within hours of the announcement of Castro’s death, President-elect Donald Trump issued this statement:<br>  “Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.<br> “While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.<br> “Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.”<br> This is exactly how a real American President would describe the death of an evil monster. At last, we have a president of whom we can be proud of once again.<br> Which is why we no longer have to mind if liberals worship evil. We no longer have to mind because they no longer matter.<br> __ <br> Ps: No, we didn’t get to meet Fidel, who sacked his underlings for inviting us. Rebel was relieved.<br> [i] Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, who adopted the made-up pseudonym of Lenin, was five-one according to British Marxist historian of the Soviet Union, Eric Hobsbawn.

Currently, earnings sit just over 14% for Q1. With market volatility in April effectively forcing a truce on hard trade stances globally, deregulation and the potential for a tax bill are now on the horizon, both of which are favorable for markets. The question will be whether Q2 earnings, with all that volatility reflected, will show something different, and whether employment will start to weaken as a result. So, all that aside, why is sentiment so low with most feeling worse off over the past 5 years than otherwise? One reason is purchasing power; another is the wealth divide.<br> * Netting out the violence of data swings during the peak of the pandemic, and looking from June of 2020 until today, purchasing power has eroded with inflation. The cumulative effect of inflation over that period moved prices higher by 24.6%. Average hourly earnings did rise every year as well, but at a slower pace, a cumulative 22.7%. That said, this excludes government transfer payments and anything related to accretion to total net worth. <br> In other words, while real wages slipped, home equity is higher, investment balances (401(k)s, IRAs, etc.) are higher, and savings balances are higher. To put that in perspective, total US net worth in June of 2020 was $60T, and it is roughly $170T today. <br> [Then chốt:] This, of course, helps wealthy folks much more than non-wealthy, which is why the conversation of wealth divide is just as important a topic as real wage growth (or decline) in the past 5 years in explaining why most feel left out. <br> This phenomenon has been occurring for a generation, and not just in the US, but much of the developed world. I would argue this has more to do with the global populist political era today than almost anything else. <br> Ask TBG:<br>  I have noticed that there is usually a comment in the newsletters about expected rate cuts by the Fed. And the expectations bounce around quite a bit. Why is this significant for investment purposes that it deserves so much mention? Thanks.~ Rod M.<br> There is a dichotomy about what the Fed futures tell us about where Monetary policy is headed, as well as the economy. Market participants monitor these for glimpses into where asset prices may move, and what they say about loose or restrictive policy in response to increasing or decreasing economic activity and inflation. Monetary policy itself has implications for liquidity, lending rates (mortgage, auto, credit card), the entire fixed income market, inflation expectations and economic growth. Do I think too much attention is paid to the Fed and monetary policy? Yes, I do. <br> However, because the world we now live in involves a larger role of the Fed than was ever dreamed, the direction of policy in advance (Fed Futures) is more widely watched. Monetary Policy has become more than just an adjustment of short-term lending rates based on a dual mandate of supporting stable prices and full employment. <br> The dramatic shift post-GFC, utilizing the power of the Fed balance sheet to be the buyer of last resort during a liquidity crisis, has morphed this simple mandate into an effective perpetual ‘put’ on market volatility. The benefit in the short run may be some perceived safety net, and the travesty over any other longer period is the erosion or at least interference of efficient capital markets. Simply put, capital market movement is now more sensitive to this data, so the investment purposes of paying attention to it all are just that. It should never drive investment decisions in and of itself; fundamentals and individual investor goals should, but it&#39;s pertinent, nonetheless.~ Brian T.

W. Norton &amp; Company, 2025)<br> OVERVIEW<br> Dr. Hal Brands, a professor of American history and foreign policy at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, has written a useful and significant study of the international system from 1900 through the first quarter of the 21st century. The volume may be divided into three interrelated themes.<br> First, Brands rapidly traces the history of democratic versus autocratic geopolitical thought for the general reader. Halford Mackinder, Alfred Thayer Mahan, and Nicholas Spykman - the defenders of Western democracies - and Major General Karl Haushofer and Aleksandr Dugin - the proponents of Eurasian autocracies - each receive an appropriate mention. However, it is the work of Halford Mackinder that receives pride of place for having predicted the essential feature of the hot and cold wars of the modern world: In short, the offshore maritime powers of Great Britain, and later the United States, sought to maintain the balance of power in Eurasia. Why? To ensure that no one power or alliance of land-based powers would manage to unify Eurasia, thereby gaining undisputed access to the manpower and resources of that supercontinent. Such access would allow a unified Eurasia to build fleets that could threaten the thalassocracies of Great Britain and the U.S.<br> The second theme, a historical treatment of the hot wars and cold wars that erupted across Eurasia since the dawn of the twentieth century, comprises the bulk of Brand’s book. Approximately 40 pages is devoted to the origins, course, and consequences of World War I, World War II, the Cold War between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S., and the second Cold War between the P.R.C. and the U.S. These four chapters are strategic histories, as Colin Gray would have characterized them, rather than general histories of each period. The author elaborates the grand strategies of the protagonists, discusses military campaigns, evaluates the strategic dilemmas that decision makers attempted to resolve during their respective conflicts, and considers the consequences, intended and otherwise, of defeat or victory.<br> Third, Brands ends his book with policy recommendations. He draws these recommendations from how Great Britain and the United States managed to emerge victorious in the first three conflicts. The maritime powers frequently delayed addressing the dangers presented by the Eurasian autocracies - their quest for more territory, more manpower, more resources, more power - until it was almost too late. Brands suggests it is critical to maintain strong alliances to contain and deter such adversaries. Furthermore, military capability must be cultivated to issue timely and credible threats. The goal: keep Eurasia internally divided.<br> In effect, our current danger grew out of the fact that the United States assumed that, after the Cold War, liberal democracy was the wave of the future. However, the diffusion of our values and institutions depended not merely on the prestige that victory over the U.S.S.R. conferred on the United States, but more significantly on the maintenance of military capability. Reliance on a “rules based international order” is woefully insufficient in maintaining the hard power needed to guarantee national security. Furthermore, post-cold war hegemonic power of the United States prompted China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, despite their ideological differences, to eventually team up.[1] These revisionist powers seek to make the world safe for empire, their empires. Grey zone conflicts, proxy wars, and the threat of war have occurred across the Eurasian rimland.<br> CARTOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATIONS OF STRATEGIC HISTORY<br> There is much to recommend this book, not the least of which is the reintroduction of classical geopolitical theory to the general reader. Brands deserves applause for having done so as a way of making sense of our current situation. Many faculty will adopt this book as a secondary reading in advanced courses in the fields of American foreign policy, strategy, and national security. <br> Nevertheless, there is one troubling and obvious oversight that should be highlighted: The general reader and the student will search in vain for maps drawn specifically to highlight classical geopolitical thought and Brands’ geohistorical arguments. A historical atlas will need to be purchased and carefully interpreted to get the most out of The Eurasian Century.<br> Furthermore, while one should never judge a book by its cover, perhaps it is legitimate to judge a cover by the themes presented in a book. The cover of Brands’ book depicts three Eurasian maps along a horizontal timeline, ~1890 to ~2030. In the first, overlaid on the timeline from ~1890 to 1930-1945, Central and Western Europe are highlighted, presumably as the Eurasian geopolitical cockpit of the period; in the third, 1978-1992 to ~2030, China, Taiwan, and the territories along the southern and western borders of China are highlighted as the new flashpoint. But what about the map of Eurasia that corresponds to the period 1930-1945 through 1978-1992?<br> Given the thesis of the book, a reader might expect to see the territory of the U.S.S.R. and the Warsaw Pact highlighted - that is the power that threatened the stability of Eurasia during the Cold War. Instead, the territory of the Indian subcontinent (including Pakistan and Bangladesh) is highlighted! What? How did this cartographic error occur? Publishers, not authors, frequently have control over what book covers depict; yet, given this egregious mistake, did the publisher miss the point of the book? Why didn’t the author demand that the central map be changed to reflect the Soviet threat?<br> Maps in a book about geopolitics do not merely adorn the argument. They should, at the very least, depict the locations mentioned in the text, saving the reader from having to constantly consult a historical atlas. However, to be truly effective, maps should offer a visual display of strategic concepts, highlight theoretically relevant locations where military conflicts begin, intensify, and are resolved, and indicate the relationship of process to critical locations, such as international commerce to maritime chokepoints.[2]<br> GEOGRAPHY, EURASIA, AND MACKINDER’S HEARTLAND THESIS<br> The cartography on the cover is indicative of some deeper issues. Let’s start with the basics. Geographers frequently characterize regions as either “uniform” in nature or “functional.” A uniform region is characterized by its one essential and significant characteristic - for instance, an “industrial” region - to enable a comparison with another, different uniform region - such as an “agricultural” region. Brands frequently deploys “Eurasia” as a “uniform” region.[3] Why?<br> Brands may believe that the China-Russia-Iran-North Korea proto-alliance gives rise to a politically uniform region in which autocracy is the most salient characteristic. Or he may believe that the Trans-Siberian Railroad, when connected to the various transportation projects promoted by China under the Belt and Road and other infrastructure initiatives, has produced or will soon produce a single economic unit in Eurasia. Or he may have emphasized Europe and Asia as a unified source of danger to the United States as distinct from the China challenge in the Indo-Pacific region.[4] Geography is often gerrymandered for political purposes. These three points are mere speculation.<br> A fourth possibility is that Brands is simplifying his geographic terminology to appeal to an audience of general readers that, in the words of the old rock and roll song, “don’t know much about geography…” Turning to the text, Brands suggests that Mackinder’s stunning 1904 presentation on “The Geographical Pivot of History”[5] combined vague abstraction, meandering narration, distant history, and mountains of geographical detail. The talk featured a long, if graceful, discussion of rivers, steppes, peaks and monsoon lands; it was full of concepts (“Pivot Area,” “Inner Crescent,” “Outer Crescent”) that then probably seemed obscure.[6]<br> Mackinder was addressing an audience of geographers and imperial policy makers, most of whom knew where the Ural Mountains, Manchuria, the Volga River, etc. were to be found. Did Mackinder depict his “obscure” concepts with maps? According to Dr. Brian Blouet, Mackinder’s biographer, Mackinder “illustrated” his talk, probably to identify the location where his concepts applied to Eurasian and world history.[7] In the published version of “The Geographical Pivot of History,” Mackinder deployed five figures, the fifth of which explicitly showed the locations of these supposedly “obscure” concepts.[8]<br> So, how does Hal Brands define Eurasia? Much depends on this definition, as “Eurasia” is not visualized in a map, even though it is his key unit of geographic analysis.<br> As the name implies, Eurasia consists of the combined expanse of those two Old World continents of the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia. It includes the outlying islands of those continents, which are closely connected to them by Eurasia’s marginal seas, as well as North Africa, which is thoroughly linked to Europe by the Mediterranean as it is blocked from the rest of Africa by the Sahara. Eurasia thus runs from littoral Asia in the East to the Iberian Peninsula and the British Isles in the West, from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Indian Ocean in the south. This “world island,” as geographer Halford Mackinder called it, is a space unlike any other.[9]<br> All but the last sentence in this characterization is correct.<br> In his masterpiece Democratic Ideals and Reality,[10] Mackinder defines the “world-island” as comprised of six (uniform) subregions: (1) the Sahara, (2) the Southern Heartland,[11] south of sub-Saharan Africa, (3) Arabia, (4) the Monsoon Coastlands (of India, Southwest Asia, and China), (5) the “European Coastland,” and finally - Mackinder’s particular contribution to our understanding of geopolitics of the 20th and the first quarter of the 21st century - (6) the “Heartland.” Thus, despite Brands’ assertion that the boundaries of the “world-island” are conterminous with Eurasia, Mackinder includes in the world-island two subregions that fall outside of Eurasia.[12] This may seem to be a mere geographical technicality, but details matter, especially when it comes to what constitutes Brands’ key unit of analysis, Eurasia, which he argues is a regional “prize without equal: it is the strategic center of the world.”[13]<br> Halford Mackinder, when characterizing the world-island, did so as a “functional” region, that is, one in which the humans living in the subregions interacted with one another economically, socially, and militarily. At the strategic center of the world-island is the Geographic Pivot, occupied by Tsarist Russia, and later termed the Eurasian Heartland. In 1904 Mackinder asked,<br> Is not the pivot region of the world&#39;s politics that vast area of Euro-Asia which is inaccessible to ships, but in antiquity lay open to the horse-riding nomads, and is to-day about to be covered with a network of railways? There have been and are here the conditions of a mobility of military and economic power of a far-reaching and yet limited character. Russia replaces the Mongol Empire. Her pressure on Finland, on Scandinavia, on Poland, on Turkey, on Persia, on India, and on China, replaces the centrifugal raids of the steppemen [sic]. In the world at large she occupies the central strategical position held by Germany in Europe. She can strike on all sides and be struck from all sides, save the north. The full development of her modern railway mobility is merely a matter of time.[14]<br> Russia, as the “Pivot” or Heartland power, exerts pressure on the lands along its borders; however, as the Heartland power, it was relatively immune from the influence of maritime power due to rivers flowing to inland seas or the Arctic, and the way the polar ice cap limited the movement of shipping. With the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, Russia acquired not merely the means to access virgin agricultural land and new mineral resources, but also internal lines of communication, travel, and transport - factors essential for rapidly moving and deploying military force. For Mackinder, the Tsarist regime threatened to overturn the balance of power in Europe and beyond by suddenly transforming the territory of the Eurasian Heartland into an economically modern and politically unified new environment.<br> Hal Brands, in emphasizing Eurasia as his unit of geographic analysis, rarely mentions Mackinder’s Heartland thesis. Surprisingly, The Eurasian Century fails to note the Heartland in the index - either as a separate term or under Mackinder’s name. Yet, in one critical passage, Brands mentions the Heartland. He quotes, in an abbreviated fashion, Mackinder’s geopolitical catechism: “Who rules the Heartland rules the World-Island; whoever rules the World-Island commands the World.”[15] Yet here too, Brands misses Mackinder’s deeper point, which is suggested by the full quote from Democratic Ideals and Reality:<br> Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland:<br> Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island:<br> Who rules the World-Island commands the World.[16]<br> Why does East Europe loom so large in Mackinder’s formulation in Democratic Ideals and Reality? First, East Europe was the land over which Germanic and Slavic peoples competed - one of the fundamental causes of World War I for Mackinder. Second, East Europe was (and remains) the gateway to the Heartland. The Northern European plain and the Danube Basin provide the two major land-based invasion routes into the Heartland. Third, in Democratic Ideals and Reality, Mackinder reformulated the Heartland thesis from a geographic region into a strategic region, where the great European autocratic powers threaten the lands along the littorals of the Baltic and Black seas.[17]<br> Finally, Mackinder envisioned Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Great Bohemia, Hungary, Great Rumania, Bulgaria, Great Serbia, and Greece[18] as: (1) a make weight against the revival of German power, (2) a bulwark, keeping the post-war Russian Communist regime outside of Europe, and (3) the foundation for a restored European balance of power. One curiosity: although Ukraine is not explicitly mentioned in the text, it does appear (without territorial boundaries) on Mackinder’s map depicting Eastern Europe.[19] In short, the Wilsonian ideals of national self-determination of the East European states and collective security through the League of Nations needed to be brought into alignment with the realities of power. In Mackinder’s vision, these newly independent nations would align with France and Great Britain, thereby putting the League on a sound footing and restoring a balance of power to Europe.<br> According to Brands, “For Mackinder, then the most critical feature of the peace was not the League of Nations. It was the creation of a cordon sanitaire between Russia and Germany - a ‘tier of independent states’ that, in defending themselves, would keep Eurasia in balance.”[20] This interpretation is correct, but not quite good enough. For Mackinder, the independent states of East Europe, once allied with the democratic and maritime powers of Western Europe, would restore the balance of power and thereby stabilize the League as a mechanism for collective security.<br> Mackinder was not a modern “realist.”[21] He recognized that ideals, such as liberty, equality, and nationalism, had historically become institutionalized as features of reality.[22] Even collective security was on the verge of becoming institutionalized when Mackinder wrote. Such ideals needed to be considered when formulating a foreign policy designed to restructure the international order in the aftermath of World War I. Therefore, the fundamental issue for Mackinder wasn’t ideals versus the reality of power in the international arena; instead, it was how to reconcile democratic ideals with the reality of power. The title of Mackinder book was not Democratic Ideals or Reality.<br> Mackinder’s Democratic Ideals and Realty was written in recognition that post-World War I democratic populations were being carried away by an overly optimistic idea of what collective security could accomplish. A correction was needed; Mackinder supplied it by imagining a new geopolitical order that mobilized many of the hitherto submerged ethnic groups of the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and German empires as autonomous nation-states.[23]<br> Brands alludes to the importance of East Europe when he evaluates the geopolitical ideas of Major General Dr. Karl E. Haushofer, the thinker whose ideas are often associated with the rise of Adolph Hitler. According to Brands: “The world, wrote Haushofer, needed ‘a general political cleaning up, a redistribution of power.’ The young Eastern European countries lying athwart Germany’s path were ‘state fragments’ that ‘have no longer a right to exist.’”[24] Brands is no doubt correct in interpreting Haushofer’s sentiment toward the East European states as a quest for lebensraum.<br> But it was more than just that. Haushofer’s attack on the legitimacy of the East European nations as mere “fragments” of states was tantamount to an assault on the inter-war balance of power, which was upheld by the alliances led by France and Great Britain. In the absence of a full-blown interpretation of Mackinder’s purpose in writing Democratic Ideals and Reality, Brands cannot provide a nuanced appreciation of Haushofer’s geopolitical thought and rhetorical tactics.<br> CONCLUSION<br> In the final analysis, Hal Brands’ book deserves to be read and discussed among students of international relations and within the foreign policy establishment. However, it does not do justice to the subtleties of classical geopolitical thought. At times, the geography in geopolitics is suppressed in favor of an aspatial assessment of great power competition and conflict. Brand’s failure to provide cartographic visualizations of strategic interactions is a telling aspect of how the geographic component in geopolitics is obscured.<br> Indeed, had Hal Brands attended to Mackinder’s overriding goal in Democratic Ideals and Reality - how to reconcile the enthusiasms and ideals of democracies with the geopolitical realities of power in international relations - he might have offered a more nuanced appreciation of how ideology and geopolitics should interact in the formulation of foreign policy. While he is undoubtedly correct that “ideology and geopolitics are inseparable,”[25] this assertion is an insufficient guide to where, under what conditions, and at what cost maritime-commercial powers should ally with a territorial-autocratic regime of the Heartland to keep Eurasia divided.<br> Acknowledgements: The author thanks Paul Rahe, Jim Sheehan, Kelly Jordan, Geoff Sloan and Michael Hochberg for their comments.

Photo: Alex Brandon/Associated Press<br> Along with the big house and a legacy, every self-respecting president likes to have a doctrine. Since James Monroe gave his name to one, most presidents have sought to codify formally or informally their engagement with the world beyond U.S. shores into a set of principles that provides a blueprint for a coherent foreign policy. (Teddy Roosevelt had to make do with a corollary rather than a full doctrine, but that didn’t stop him from being among the more consequential presidents.)<br> Presidential doctrine is both rhetorical and empirical, carefully crafted in speeches that capture the administration’s intentions and aspirations, and executed in presidential action. In his 1985 State of the Union address, Ronald Reagan pithily captured his doctrine with the claim that “Support for freedom fighters is self-defense.” He exemplified it with active assistance to anticommunists from Kabul to Managua.<br> The problem with trying to identify a Trump Doctrine is that, as with so much about this most unique of American leaders, there’s no guarantee of consistency from one day to the next - either rhetorically or empirically. Take the largest strategic question that confronts the U.S. for the next generation at least: Are we trying to decouple from China? A month ago it seemed an all-out tariff war would more or less end U.S.-Chinese economic interdependence. With last week’s cease-fire, the administration is touting opportunities with Beijing again.<br> Last week in Saudi Arabia we got as clear a verbal and practical account of a Trump Doctrine as we have had since he first took office eight years ago. It was the familiar deal-making president but with the style raised to the level of strategy on a scale we haven’t seen before, and it was clearly, on his terms, a big success.<br> When discussing the promises of foreign potentates it is always hard to disentangle realizable commitment from sycophantic mendacity, and all U.S. presidents inflate the actual value of deals they strike on these visits, so some of the tales told of investments and trade to come from this trip were taller than a petrostate skyscraper. But even if you don’t believe the $2 trillion in “great deals” the White House claimed from the trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, there isn’t much doubt that, along with a lot of royal pomp and circumstance of the sort he loves, Mr. Trump got some genuine bargains for the U.S. economy.<br> “Trade follows the flag” was the term that captured British foreign-policy doctrine at the peak of its empire: Commercial opportunity would follow from the country’s pursuit of diplomatic, military and strategic objectives. Mr. Trump’s approach seems like a characteristic inversion: The flag follows trade.<br> His vision appears to be making the top priority economic relations, allied to a ruthless pursuit of national interest shorn of idealism, as laid out in his big speech in Riyadh. It is an unusual mix of materialism and foreign-policy realism - <br> “mater-realism” perhaps.<br> You can see the logic behind it. He isn’t wrong that successive American presidents’ pursuit of high-minded ideals has often failed twice over. In the Middle East especially, they didn’t achieve their objectives of greater freedom, peace and stability for the region and security for the U.S., and the efforts came at large cost to Americans. Why not drop the failed idealism and chase the dollars? It not only enhances America’s economic power with valuable trade and investment; it advances our strategic interests too.<br> Look at China for inspiration: While U.S. administrations have sought regime change and democracy in the Middle East and elsewhere, China steadily executed a less preachy and less expensive economics-based approach to strategic advancement. The biggest deal Mr. Trump pulled off last week might have been to start rolling back decades of Beijing’s influence-expansion.<br> With Mr. Trump and his family there is always the added appeal of a little personal enrichment to skim something off the top. A crypto-fund billion or two here, a $400 million dollar plane there, and pretty soon you’re talking serious money. “Baksheesh” the locals call it, but to use our own more recently developed, vernacular, it looks a lot like “10% for the Big Guy.” Mr Trump wouldn’t be the first president to use his position for financial gain; allies would say he’s just better at it and that in any case, since it’s all public, the risk of corrupt influence is minimized. The Emoluments Clause of the Constitution begs to differ.<br> The principal risk of Mr. Trump’s mater-realism is that economic and strategic interests aren’t always aligned. Take his effort at détente with Iran. This seems prompted at least in part by a desire to reward the regime in Riyadh, which has been steadily improving relations with Tehran over the past few years. Or his decision to lift sanctions on Syria and meet with its new president. Mr. Trump may have found Ahmed al Sharaa “young, attractive and tough,” but not long ago he was fighting a terrorist war against the U.S. in Iraq. This too seems to have been prompted in part by Saudi interests. Is any of this really going to keep the region secure and America safe?<br> High-flown idealism has certainly come at a price, but money won’t buy you peace and security either.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R238" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">239</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2933px;left:-1px">VÀI SỰ THẬT VỀ QUỸ CỨU TRỢ Y TẾ MEDICAID<br> Hội đồng Biên tập I&amp;I trình bày thực trạng của quỹ cứu trợ y tế Medicaid mà nhiều người có thể không nắm vững.

They’re cutting health care for the poor to pay for tax cuts for the rich! Millions will lose coverage! The disabled will suffer! Oh, the humanity!<br> Well, if the GOP is going to be accused of destroying Medicaid when all they are proposing is a minor haircut, why not go all out and scrap this hopelessly flawed, fraud-riddled, budget-busting disaster of a program and start over from scratch?<br> First, let’s dispense with the claim of “devastating” cuts to Medicaid. The House reconciliation bill would reduce Medicaid spending by $625 billion. That might sound like a lot, but it’s stretched out over 10 years, at a time when Medicaid is on track to spend $8.6 trillion. Medicaid spending will still go up every year under the House bill, just a tiny bit more slowly.<br> What Republicans should really be talking about is giving Medicaid the USAID treatment. Shut it down and start over from scratch.<br> Let’s line up the reasons.<br> It was sold on a lie. The original claim made in the mid-1960s was that the federal government and the states would split the cost of Medicaid. But that happened only once: in the program’s first year. Ever since, the federal share has grown while the states’ shares have shrunk. By 2005, states were paying only 42% of Medicaid’s bills. In 2022, the state share dipped below 30%.<br> Over the past 60 years, states have pressured federal lawmakers to make a multitude of exceptions to the 50-50 split, which lawmakers were only too happy to provide because there is no cap on federal Medicaid spending.<br> It is ripe for waste and fraud. This financing scheme, in turn, gives states little incentive to run their programs efficiently. Why should they? They are paying only a fraction of the costs. Plus, for every dollar of waste or fraud a state eliminates, it loses even more money from the feds.<br> “Official government reports conservatively estimate that improper Medicaid payments total half a trillion dollars over the last decade, but outside estimates place that figure closer to $1.1 trillion,” notes the Cato Institute’s Dominik Lett.<br> In other words, just cutting out waste and fraud would more than cover the “cuts” the GOP is proposing.<br> But that will never happen so long as states are paying pennies on the dollar for Medicaid.<br> States use Medicaid to steal federal money. On top of this, as we pointed out in this space earlier, states also figured out how to game the system through “provider taxes.” The way it works is that states impose a special tax on Medicaid providers, boost Medicaid reimbursement rates to cover the cost of the tax, and then send the bill to Congress. Congress has tried to rein in this abuse, but to no avail.<br> Back in 2011, when Joe Biden was vice president and more mentally capable, he called this a scam, said states were gaming the system, and said there was no reason for Congress not to stop it. The Congressional Budget Office says the 10-year cost of this one racket is $600 billion – almost exactly what the GOP wants to cut. (See “Dems Fight To Protect A $600 Billion Medicaid Tax Scam That Joe Biden Tried To Kill.”)<br> Spending is out of control. It should come as no surprise, then, that Medicaid spending is exploding. Over the past 10 years, Medicaid’s costs have gone up by more than 68%. They are on track to climb another 56% over the next 10 years.<br> The quality of care is lousy. Even with these massive costs, quality of care is far from optimal. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey finds that more than half of Medicaid enrollees say they’ve had a problem with their insurance in the past year, with 26% saying they couldn’t get recommended care and 22% saying they experienced “significant” delays in getting care.<br> An NIH study found that “Medicaid patients have greater difficulty obtaining appointments compared with privately insured patients across a variety of medical scenarios.” An article in Health Affairs found that far fewer doctors were accepting new Medicaid patients than either Medicare or privately insured ones.<br> The reason is that Medicaid pays doctors less than either Medicare or private insurance, and piles on mountains of paperwork.<br> Tweaking the program won’t solve any of these problems.<br> The only real solution is to scrap Medicaid and figure out a 21st-century solution to providing quality health care to the nation’s poor.<br> An obvious first step would be to get the federal government out of the picture entirely. Just send the Medicaid money to states in the form of a fixed block grant and let them figure out how to efficiently care for their poor.<br> Or better still, stop taking hundreds of billions of tax dollars out of states only to give the money back – minus federal overhead costs and with a multitude of strings added.<br> The left would scream bloody murder. But the only losers would be the legions of Medicaid grifters and fraudsters who are getting rich while pretending to care for the poor.<br> — Written by the I&amp;I Editorial Board</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R239" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">240</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3923px;left:-1px">BIDEN BỊ UNG THƯ TỪ KHI NÀO, SAO BÂY GIỜ MỚI LAN TỎA?<br> Một giáo sư y khoa tại Stanford, là bác sĩ chuyên trị ung thư, nêu câu hỏi là Joe Biden bị ung thư từ khi nào mà bây giờ mới phát giác là ung thư đã lan tỏa? Câu hỏi chí lý khiến ta nên chú ý…<br> https://thespectator.com/.../likely-joe-biden-prostate.../<br> ‘Highly likely’ Biden had prostate cancer diagnosis in the White House<br> Cancer expert Dr. Steven Quay believes it would constitute malpractice to only get such a diagnosis now<br> (By Dr. Steven Quay - The Spectator - Sunday, May 18, 2025)<br> Joe Biden<br> (Getty)<br> How does metastatic prostate cancer “suddenly” appear in someone like Joe Biden?<br> It doesn’t appear overnight, it festers. In rare but dangerous cases, prostate cancer bypasses the usual slow growth and strikes fast, especially in older men. If he wasn’t screened regularly, or had an aggressive subtype that evaded PSA detection, it could have advanced under the radar. But how can we imagine that a President was not screened properly?<br> Prostate cancer is the easiest cancer to diagnose. The PSA blood test shows the rate of cancer cell growth. Even with the most aggressive form, it is a 5-7 year journey without treatment before it becomes metastatic. Meaning, it would be malpractice for this patient to show up and be first diagnosed with metastatic disease in May 2025. It is highly likely he was carrying a diagnosis of prostate cancer throughout his White House tenure and the American people were uninformed.<br> Should it have been caught earlier?<br> Yes. Localized prostate cancer is often curable. Once it escapes the capsule and spreads, we shift from cure to containment. A missed or delayed diagnosis is a critical failure point.<br> Is this rare?<br> About 10-15 percent of prostate cancers are diagnosed first at stage IV, when it is in the bones like this is. Among men over 80, especially those with inconsistent screening, it’s more common. Again, for a president of the United States to be diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer is malpractice, in my opinion.<br> What is the modern treatment for metastatic prostate cancer, and what should patients expect in terms of side effects?<br> Today’s treatment for metastatic prostate cancer isn’t your grandfather’s medicine cabinet. It’s a high-tech playbook combining hormone suppression, precision radiation, smart drugs and sometimes immunotherapy. The first step usually shuts down testosterone, because this hormone fuels prostate cancer like gasoline on a fire. That’s done through drugs or injections called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Then, a second-line agent, think of it as a smarter missile, is added. Drugs like enzalutamide or abiraterone block the cancer’s ability to rewire itself and keep growing.<br> But this isn’t without cost. Common side effects include fatigue, hot flashes, weakened bones and a drop in sexual function. Some treatments can affect the liver or raise blood pressure. It’s a trade-off: extra years of life, but with closer medical supervision and adjustments along the way. Still, with today’s tools, many men live for years after diagnosis; active, engaged, and very much still in the fight.<br> Could political considerations, like running for re-election, have delayed treatment?<br> That’s the uncomfortable question. The 800-pound gorilla in the room. If early signs were dismissed or downplayed to maintain a campaign image, then yes, treatment could’ve been compromised. Every month matters with aggressive variants. Delaying biopsy, imaging, or therapy to protect political optics may have come at a steep biological price. This is speculation, of course.<br> The highest probability is that the diagnosis has been known for many years but a calculated decision was made to not announce it, not treat it, and hope after the re-election the treatment could be done when it was still a local disease. An unfortunate turn of events.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R240" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">241</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:1933px;left:-1px">“BIRTHRIGHT”, TRUMP và TỐI CAO PHÁP VIỆN<br> Tuần này, Tối Cao Pháp Viện Hoa Kỳ còn phân vân về hồ sơ Birthright do Chính quyền Trump quyết định qua một sắc lệnh hành pháp mà nhiều tòa án liên bang lại bác bỏ. <br> The Epoch Times tổng hợp một số chi tiết về bối cảnh cho các độc giả dễ theo dõi:<br> https://www.theepochtimes.com/.../supreme-court-weighs...<br> US - US News<br> Supreme Court Weighs Trump’s Birthright Citizenship Challenge<br> Trump’s challenge to the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment could change a 100-year precedent.<br> Supreme Court Weighs Trump’s Birthright Citizenship Challenge<br> A pregnant illegal immigrant from El Salvador stands next to a U.S. Border Patrol truck near Rio Grande City, Texas, on Dec. 7, 2015. John Moore/Getty Images<br> (By Stuart Liess - The Epoch Times - 5/19/2025)<br> The United States’ highest court this week seemed divided over whether lower court judges had overstepped their authority in blocking the Trump administration’s attempts to limit birthright citizenship.<br> Federal judges had put a nationwide block on President Donald Trump’s attempt to remove automatic citizenship status from children born in the United States to immigrants with noncitizen status.<br> The question at hand is whether the federal judges were allowed to do this. The Trump administration argues they do not, and have overstepped their jurisdiction in this matter.<br> The decision will also determine the limits of presidential power and whether a president can make such decisions, which will then determine the authority of judges in blocking Trump’s agenda on a much broader level in other cases where he is facing legal challenges.<br> The United States’ governance system is based on a series of checks and balances where the president enforces laws that Congress has made, and the Supreme Court interprets them and can even overrule them if it deems the laws unconstitutional.<br> Since Inauguration Day, Trump has signed 151 executive orders, which are directives by the president ordering the government to take specific actions. Their limitations, however, are that they cannot overrule existing federal law or statutes created by Congress.<br> President Joe Biden signed 162 executive orders during his term, and President Barack Obama signed 277 executive orders during his eight years of office. Trump signed a total of 220 during his entire first term.<br> Critics of Trump argue that he is overstepping his presidential authority on a number of decisions.<br> The president declared a national emergency on Jan. 20, vowing to solve the country’s illegal immigration crisis and fulfilling one of his campaign promises to stop an “invasion” at the border.<br> Trump has vowed to end “birth tourism,” in which he says illegal immigrants are giving birth in this country so that the children will be U.S. citizens.<br> According to Pew Research Center, the illegal immigrant population was at a 15-year high of 11 million in 2022, while border encounters have been soaring in recent years.<br> U.S. southern border apprehensions reached a high of 370,883 in December 2023, before dropping in 2024, according to Customs and Border Protection data.<br> The latest data recorded an 88 percent drop from the previous year, with 29,238 encounters in April this year falling from 247,929 around the same time in 2024.<br> Constitutional Reinterpretation<br> The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, addressing the citizenship rights of American-born former slaves.<br> Then in 1898, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Wong Kim Ark, who was born in the United States but was denied reentry after leaving to visit China. The justices said a child born in the United States became a citizen at birth. This set the precedent for birthright citizenship.<br> Trump argues that the amendment was misinterpreted, and the act of birthright citizenship doesn’t necessarily apply to all children born in the United States, particularly immigrants who entered unlawfully or people on a temporary visa.<br> The statement from the Constitution in question reads: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”<br> The president has argued that the phrase “the jurisdiction thereof” should be interpreted as meaning that the person has sworn allegiance to the country, and to qualify, one parent would need to be a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident.<br> The United States is one of about 30 countries that currently offer automatic citizenship by birth. Neighbouring Canada and Mexico do the same.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R241" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">242</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:11409px;left:-1px">UNDERSTANDING WAR TỔNG HỢP VỀ CHIẾN SỰ UKRAINE<br> Với nhiều chi tiết nên biết về tình hình của ngày hôm nay:<br> https://www.understandingwar.org/.../russian-offensive...<br> Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, May 19, 2025<br> May 19, 2025 - ISW Press<br> Christina Harward, Daria Novikov, Anna Harvey, Nicole Wolkov, Grace Mappes, and Kateryna Stepanenko<br> May 19, 2025, 5:30 pm ET<br> Click here to see ISW’s interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

ISW will cover subsequent reports in the May 20 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment.<br> US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call on May 19 to discuss ceasefire and peace negotiations regarding Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine. Trump stated that he and Putin agreed that Russia and Ukraine will immediately begin bilateral negotiations about both a ceasefire and a peace agreement.[1] Trump also said that he called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after his conversation with Putin and informed them that bilateral negotiations will begin immediately. Trump stated that the Vatican is &quot;very interested in hosting the negotiations.&quot; Trump also expressed interest in reviving US–Russian trade after Ukraine and Russia agree to a peace deal and said that Ukraine could also benefit from trade during the reconstruction process. Putin spoke to journalists following the call on May 19 and stated that he and Trump agreed that Russia would present Ukraine with a &quot;memorandum&quot; detailing conditions and timing for a future peace treaty as the two countries move toward conducting bilateral negotiations.[2] Putin also stated that Russia’s &quot;main&quot; concern is the elimination of the war’s &quot;root causes,&quot; reiterating a long-standing Kremlin narrative calling for the replacement of the current Ukrainian government with a Russian proxy government and Ukraine&#39;s commitment to neutrality.[3] Russian Presidential Aide Yuriy Ushakov told journalists on May 19 that Trump and Putin also discussed a possible nine-for-nine US–Russian prisoner exchange.[4]<br> Zelensky stated that he spoke with Trump before Trump&#39;s call with Putin and spoke with Trump, Macron, Meloni, Merz, Stubb, and von der Leyen following the Trump–Putin call.[5] Zelensky reaffirmed Ukraine&#39;s readiness for a full unconditional ceasefire as Trump has previously proposed. Zelensky stated that Ukraine is ready for direct negotiations with Russia &quot;in any format&quot; and offered Turkey, the Vatican, or Switzerland as possible venues for talks. Zelensky called for the negotiation process to involve both American and European representatives &quot;at the appropriate level.&quot; Russia must break its pattern of protracting negotiations and failing to offer any meaningful concessions to Ukraine in order for legitimate and good-faith negotiations to lead to a lasting and sustainable end to its war against Ukraine.<br> Russia must explicitly acknowledge the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and constitution and Ukraine&#39;s sovereignty in order to engage in meaningful, good-faith negotiations. Putin and other Kremlin officials have repeatedly falsely claimed that Zelensky is the illegitimate leader according to the Ukrainian Constitution and that all Ukrainian governments since 2014 are also illegitimate.[6] Ukraine&#39;s Constitution and law explicitly state that Ukraine cannot hold elections while martial law is in place and that Ukrainian authorities cannot lift martial law while &quot;the threat of attack or danger to the state independence of Ukraine and its territorial integrity&quot; remains.[7] Russia and Ukraine cannot engage in meaningful negotiations so long as Russia refuses to recognize the negotiating authority of Ukraine. Russian officials have forwarded the narrative about the Ukrainian government&#39;s alleged illegitimacy as recently as May 17, and ISW continues to assess that this Russian effort is aimed at setting conditions for Russia to renege on any future Ukrainian–Russian agreements at a time of Russia&#39;s choosing.[8] Any future peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine must include Russia&#39;s explicit recognition of the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and constitution.<br> Russia must agree that ceasefire negotiations must precede peace settlement negotiations. The United States, Ukraine, and Europe have repeatedly called for the establishment of a ceasefire to allow for diplomatic talks to end Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine to proceed.[9] Russia has consistently rejected this sequence of events as part of efforts to hold any ceasefire talks hostage to extract additional concessions from Ukraine and the West.[10] ISW continues to assess that Russia is committed to prolonging peace negotiations so as to continue making battlefield advances.[11] Peace talks ahead of an established ceasefire would allow Russia to continue to make advances in Ukraine, which Russia would likely try to leverage in Ukrainian–Russian talks to extract further concessions. Any future ceasefire will require Russia and Ukraine to engage in separate negotiations to agree on the necessary robust monitoring mechanisms, and conflating ceasefire talks with peace settlement talks will likely delay the implementation of a ceasefire.<br> Russia must show its willingness to make concessions of its own in any future bilateral negotiations, especially as the Kremlin appears to be setting conditions to expand its list of demands amid the peace talks.[12] Russian officials have called for Ukraine to cede all of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts - even the areas that Russian forces do not currently occupy - before Russia can agree to a ceasefire.[13] Territorial demands are typically the subject of war termination negotiations, not ceasefire talks. Russia has reportedly already started to increase its demands, with Western and Ukrainian sources reporting that the Russian delegation threatened to seize Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts - two oblasts that Russia has not illegally annexed or claimed - during the May 16 talks in Istanbul.[14] This tactic suggests that Russia will make additional, more extreme territorial demands during war termination talks should Ukraine agree to Russia&#39;s ceasefire preconditions.<br> Russia reportedly continues to expand its military infrastructure along its border with Finland and Estonia, likely in preparation for future aggression against NATO. The New York Times (NYT) reported on May 19 that recent satellite imagery, which NATO officials confirmed, shows that Russia is building bases and military infrastructure near the Finnish and Estonian borders.[15] The NYT reported that Russian forces are building and renovating tents, vehicle storage warehouses, fighter jet shelters, and helicopter bases at Olenya and Alakurtti air bases in Murmansk Oblast, Kamenka Air Base in Komi Republic, and Petrozavodsk Air Base in the Republic of Karelia. A senior NATO official stated that Russia will likely redeploy troops further north when its war in Ukraine ends and that Russia assesses that its access to the Arctic is key for its great power status. The NYT stated that Finnish defense officials predict that it will take Russia roughly five years to build up its forces to threatening levels after the war in Ukraine is over, possibly tripling the number of Russian forces on the Finnish border. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) similarly reported in April 2025 that Western military and intelligence officials stated that Russia is expanding military bases near Petrozavodsk and upgrading railway lines and other infrastructure along Russia&#39;s western border with NATO.[16] Russian Presidential Aide and former Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev recently used narratives similar to those that the Kremlin has used to justify its invasions of Ukraine to threaten Finland.[17]<br> Ukraine&#39;s Western allies continue to provide military aid to Ukraine. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on May 18 and confirmed the provision of Abrams tanks to Ukraine, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported on May 19 that the first of 49 Abrams tanks are en route to Ukraine.[18] Denmark announced on May 17 a military aid package for Ukraine worth 4.2 billion Danish kroner (about $632 million) for 2025–2028 that includes artillery systems and ammunition, equipment for fighter jets, and funding for Ukrainian Air Force training facilities.[19] The Finnish Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced on May 19 that it signed an agreement with the European Commission to supply Ukraine with materiel and heavy ammunition worth 90 million euros (about $101 million) using the profits from Russian frozen assets.[20]<br> Key Takeaways:<br> 1/ US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call on May 19 to discuss ceasefire and peace negotiations regarding Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine.<br> 2/ Russia must explicitly acknowledge the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and constitution and Ukraine&#39;s sovereignty in order to engage in meaningful, good-faith negotiations.<br> 3/ Russia must agree that ceasefire negotiations must precede peace settlement negotiations.<br> 4/ Russia must show its willingness to make concessions of its own in any future bilateral negotiations, especially as the Kremlin appears to be setting conditions to expand its list of demands amid the peace talks.<br> 5/ Russia reportedly continues to expand its military infrastructure along its border with Finland and Estonia, likely in preparation for future aggression against NATO.<br> 6/ Ukraine&#39;s Western allies continue to provide military aid to Ukraine.<br> 7/ Ukrainian forces recently advanced in Kursk Oblast and near Borova and Toretsk.

The written version is here (my favorite), the video is here, and the podcast is here.<br> Off we go …<br>  Market Action<br> Markets opened at the low of the day (down over 300 points) and steadily climbed higher throughout the day.<br> The Dow closed up +137 points (+0.32%), the S&amp;P 500 up nine basis points, and the Nasdaq dead flat.<br> *CNBC, DJIA, May 19, 2025<br> The media would have you believe the story of the day was the Moody’s downgrade of U.S. debt, but I am not convinced that is true. The Aa1 rating (one notch below AAA) was basically the same that Standard &amp; Poor’s and Fitch already had, and of course, there isn’t anything in the downgrade rationale that has not been brutally and painfully obvious to everyone with a pulse for over a decade. I am sure there is some symbolic significance in the downgrade for someone, somewhere, but no, it is not some revelatory announcement, whatsoever.<br> The ten-year bond yield closed today at 4.45%, up just one basis point on the day (after hitting 4.56% at one point). Moody’s can take comfort in the fact that markets responded to their warning for almost thirty minutes!<br> Top-performing sector for the day: Health Care (+0.96%)<br> Bottom-performing sector for the day: Energy (-1.55%)<br> Wal-Mart announced last week that they saw little choice but passing along the impact of tariffs to consumers. President Trump tweeted that they should not do that, and “he would be watching them.” Wal-Mart has an average margin of 2.9% on goods sold. The period between the two and the nine is not a typo.<br> Japan ships $40 billion of automobiles to the United States per year (1.5 million cars), 30% of its total exports!! You may have heard that Americans like their automobiles. The tariff Japan charges on U.S. auto imports is 0%, but you may have heard they don’t much care for our autos. How a deal gets worked out here, I am not sure. My sources tell me this deal was thought to be one of the easier ones, and is becoming one of the harder ones.<br>  Top News Stories<br> President Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin today and then, separately, with Zelenskyy of Ukraine. His follow-up “tweets” suggested that both parties are moving forward with talking about talking about a talk to enact a cease-fire, and ultimately an end to the hostilities. I don’t want to make light of what transpired – there was a not insignificant risk that the call would result in significant regress, and it appears to have not gone that way. But yes, there is a long way to go.<br> The Biden family announced last night that former President Biden has been diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer.<br>  Public Policy<br> Late Sunday night the conservative hardliners (I hate that term) did allow the House budget bill out of committee (they had blocked it as of Friday), but that is a far cry from getting the full House vote needed, and getting the Senate vote, and getting the Senate version to be one the House will accept after revisions.<br> There has not been a lot announced on what has been modified in the bill from Friday to get those who were holding it up in committee to agree, but the general understanding I have is that the “minor modifications” include a more imminent enforcement of work requirements for Medicaid and more aggressive removal of clean energy tax credits.<br> The latest draft includes a $40,000 SALT deduction cap (vs. the $30,000 proposed in last week’s bill), but with a $200,000 income limit that really is moot. Speaker Johnson is meeting with the SALT caucus at 9:00 pm tonight.<br> The next step is the Rules Panel hearing set for… wait for it… 1:00 am on Wednesday morning (with a floor vote on the House desired for Thursday)<br> My own view continues to be that the story here has changed, whereby the focus in the public is now on whether or not the politics will end up accruing to the President’s favor (that is, will he get the cosmetic win of a bill passing), and yet the focus of markets will be on the bill, itself. In other words, no matter how much dancing takes place between now and then, I think they are getting a bill – I just think it is proving to be a much less consequential one than previously believed.<br>  Economic Front<br> The Producer Price Index (PPI) declined by -0.5% in April, bringing the year-over-year PPI to just +2.4%. Energy and Food wholesale prices were down but the Core PPI was also down -4% in April. Goods prices are up +0.5% year-over-year, with Services up +3.3% year-over-year.<br> Freight shipments from China were up +275% this week versus the week prior in the aftermath of the Trump reversal on tariffs with China.<br> Retail sales rose +0.1% in April and are up +5.2% vs. a year ago.<br> Japan’s economy contracted 0.2% last quarter, more than expected, which is not helping Japan much in terms of leverage regarding the trade discussions with the Trump administration.<br>  Housing &amp; Mortgage<br> The NAHB Sentiment Index for May was abysmal, dropping six more points (to 34). This was the weakest it has been since late 2022 and reflects very poor Present Situation read and very weak Prospective Buyers Traffic. The tariff issues around lumber, steel, and aluminum have created huge issues for builders (78% saying it has created difficulties pricing homes).<br> Housing starts rose 1.6% in April to a 1.36 million annualized rate, below the consensus expectation, and down -1.7% from the low level of last year’s starts. Single-family starts are actually down -12% over the last year, as all net new housing starts are in the multi-family category.<br>  Federal Reserve<br> We are sitting at a 92% probability of no change in the Fed Funds rate at the June meeting now, so yes, those praying for a rate cut, 8% odds are “saying there’s a chance.”<br> What is a bigger change is that we are only at 35% implied probability of a rate cut in July, now, as the Presidential reversal on tariff threats reduced the odds of the economic distress the market was pricing in as a catalyst to a cut.<br> And along those lines, we are now sitting at a 23% chance of just one cut by the end of the year, a 38% chance of two cuts, a 26% chance of three cuts, and only 7% of four cuts (with some minimal odds around the edges to round out).<br>  Oil and Energy<br> WTI Crude closed at $62.10, up a tiny bit.<br> Midstream energy stocks were up +2.5% last week, refiner stocks (downstream) were up HUGE, and upstream was somewhere in the middle. Crude itself was up about +2.5%. All aspects of the energy story were taking in the China tariff suspension early in the week and improved economic outlook from there.<br> MLPs particularly shone last week (up around 4-5%) but had lagged the week prior.<br> Ask TBG<br>  “Thanks for writing this week about Warren Buffett. Your missive was not what I expected, but excellent in a very different way and insightful as always. My questions are: (1) Why have so many tried to emulate the portfolio management style of Buffett and Munger, but so few followed Berkshire’s actual business model? (2) Is there any credence to Berkshire using leverage from owning insurance and reinsurance balance sheet assets? And (3) They own dividend and growing dividend equities but do not pay a dividend… Help me understand?” @ Fred H.<br> I think the current effort of Ackman with Hughes is a good example of how some do see the general appeal of the Berkshire model. Getting permanent capital, a Holdco with that regulatory apparatus, and the permanent capital and recurring cash flows of that insurance model, is not exactly easy to replicate. I also suspect some have tried versions of the structure that we have never really seen because the execution failed before we would have been privy.<br> I think there is category confusion here. They certainly cannot (and have not) “borrowed” from the balance sheets of insurance companies to buy assets for the Berkshire balance sheet. But perhaps what you are referring to is the embedded recurring cash flows the insurance models provide that provide benefit (and permanent opportunity flow) to the hold co? But that is the essence of the model itself, and I think a misnomer to label it “leverage.”<br> It is functionally (for owners) a fund where dividends are set to “reinvest” … The hold co receives dividends – the dividends grow – but it is not a mutual fund, and their entire business model is based on finding other business opportunities. Their universe for investible opportunities is infinite and as #1 and #2 above refer to the model is based on reinvestment of recurring cash flows (one summary I heard years ago was they go short fear (i.e. receive insurance premiums), and use those premiums to go long America (i.e buying railroads and blue chips and industrials and energy and so forth and so on). But the dividend reality and dividend growth reality, while not inherently the same as my investment philosophy, is indeed embedded within many of the companies of the hold co – but why the hold co does not pay it out speaks to the entire essence of what the hold co is. I think people wondering about this view Berkshire Hathaway as a mutual fund or “active stock portfolio,” which is simply not accurate.<br>  On Deck<br> All eyes are on the tax bill, with the FOMC meeting behind us and earnings season behind us.<br> Reach out with any questions, as always!<br> With regards,<br> David L.

It allows officials to grant temporary legal immigration status to migrants from disaster- or war-stricken countries for up to 18 months at a time. Under the program, immigrants can get work permits and other documentation to live in the U.S. <br> During his first term, President Trump laid the groundwork for granting protections to Venezuelans by issuing an order that deferred deportations, citing instability under the government of Nicolás Maduro. The Biden administration formalized and extended those protections several times through October 2026.<br> Trump’s push to curtail incoming migration and increase deportations has met significant roadblocks in the courts, teeing up confrontations between the executive and judicial branches. <br> The Supreme Court has previously blocked the administration’s efforts to deport groups of Venezuelan migrants on minimal notice and without hearings, at least temporarily. The high court is also weighing the White House’s appeal of lower-court rulings that blocked a Trump mandate to end birthright citizenship. <br> “Temporary Protected Status is, by definition, temporary, and is committed to the discretion of the DHS secretary. District courts have no right to prevent the executive branch from enforcing our immigration laws,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Monday afternoon. <br> Stripping the protection would mean nearly 350,000 people would immediately lose the right to live and work in the U.S., according to the group of migrants that brought the challenge. The Trump administration has also moved to rescind temporary protected status from some migrants from Haiti and Afghanistan.<br> In a brief seeking the high court’s intervention, Solicitor General John Sauer said that Congress gave DHS broad authority to designate unsafe countries and to manage the TPS program.<br> Lawyers for the plaintiffs - the National TPS Alliance, an organization representing migrants in the U.S. protected under the program - argued that Noem didn’t have the authority to terminate the program early and was motivated by racism against Venezuelans.<br> The immediate rescission of the protections is unprecedented, according to Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, and counsel for plaintiffs.<br> “That the Supreme Court authorized it in a two-paragraph order with no reasoning is truly shocking. The humanitarian and economic impact of the Court’s decision will be felt immediately, and will reverberate for generations,” Arulanantham said.<br> Write to Mariah Timms at mariah.timms@wsj.com</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R244" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">245</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:7473px;left:-1px">ĐẢNG DÂN CHỦ LẠC LOÀI...

For years, the Connecticut Senator, who took office shortly after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, was one of the nation’s most outspoken advocates for tighter gun laws. Gun safety was so important, he argued, that supporting an assault-weapons ban should be mandatory for Democratic leaders. <br> Recently, Murphy has come to believe he was wrong. Not about tougher gun laws, but about trying to force all Democrats to adopt his position. “I bear some responsibility for where we are today,” he told me in a phone interview in April. “I spent a long time trying to make the issue of guns a litmus test for the Democratic Party. I think that all of the interest groups that ended up trying to apply a litmus test for their issue ended up making our coalition a lot smaller.”<br> Murphy’s shift in thinking is part of the reckoning that has gripped the party since President Donald Trump’s victory in November. Democrats could dismiss Trump’s first win as a fluke. His second, they know, was the product of catastrophic failure - a nationwide rejection of Democratic policies, Democratic messaging, and the Democrats themselves. The party got skunked in every battleground state and lost the popular vote for the first time in 20 years. They lost the House and the Senate. Their support sagged with almost every demographic cohort except Black women and college-educated voters. Only 35% of Democrats are optimistic about the future of the party, according to a May 14 AP poll, down from nearly 6 in 10 last July. Democrats have no mojo, no power, and no unifying leader to look to for a fresh start.<br> Lost: The Democrats Time Magazine cover<br> TIME photo illustration; Source Images (Donkey: Richard Bailey -Corbis/Getty Images; Paper: MirageC/Moment/Getty Images)<br> Everyone knows how bad things are. “As weak as I’ve ever seen it,” says Representative Jared Golden of Maine, who represents a district Trump won. Trump’s second term is “worse than everyone imagined,” says Nevada Senator Jacky Rosen. The Democratic National Committee has offered few answers as it prepares to release a “postelection review” sometime this summer. “I don’t like to call it an ‘autopsy’ because our party’s not dead - we’re still alive and kicking,” explains Ken Martin, the new party chair. “Maybe barely, but we are.”<br> You already know most of the reasons for the 2024 fiasco. Joe Biden was too old to be President, and just about everybody but Joe Biden knew it. His sheer oldness undermined all efforts to sell his policies effectively. Democrats lost touch with the working class, with men, with voters of color, with the young. Voters saw Democrats as henpecked by college-campus progressives, overly focused on “woke” issues like diversity and trans rights. They tried to convince people that the economy was good when it didn’t feel good; they tried to convince people that inflation and illegal immigration were imaginary problems. In an era when voters around the globe were in an anti-incumbent mood, Democrats were stuck defending the status quo. The pandemic election of 2020 and the post-Dobbs midterms in 2022 lulled top party officials into a dangerous complacency. They thought Americans hated Trump enough to accept an unsatisfying alternative. They thought wrong. <br> Over the past two months, I’ve spoken to dozens of prominent Democrats, from Senators to strategists, frontline House members to upstart progressives, and activists to top DNC officials, in an effort to figure out how the party can chart its way back. I asked them all versions of the same questions. How did they dig this hole, and how can they get out of it? What ideas do Democrats stand for, beyond opposing an unpopular President? How can they reconnect with the voters they’ve lost? Who should be leading them, and what should they be saying? In other words: What’s the plan? <br> Many of these conversations made my head hurt. Democrats kept presenting cliches as insights and old ideas as new ideas. Everybody said the same things; nobody seemed to be really saying anything at all. But in between feeble platitudes about “showing up and listening” and “fighting for the working class” and “meeting people where they are,” a few common threads emerged.<br> Chris Murphy<br> Murphy has reconsidered his approach to litmus tests and leaned in to economic populism Jose Luis Magana — AP<br> Democrats know they have a branding problem that transcends policy, messaging, or leadership questions. They largely agree they need to re-center economic issues in their messaging and develop what some are calling a “patriotic populism” to counter Trump. They need to build a bigger tent. Many moderate Democrats want to sideline the activist groups that pressured elected officials to take unpopular positions. Even many progressives are retreating from the purity politics that reigned in the Trump era. They know they need fresh ideas and new leaders, even though they can’t always agree on how to find them.<br> The intraparty squabbles between moderates and progressives that have dominated the past decade have given way to different fault lines. “If you’re talking about ‘conservative’ or ‘liberal,’ or ‘progressive’ or ‘moderate,’ you’re missing the whole f-cking point,” says Representative Pat Ryan, who outran Kamala Harris by double digits in his purple district in New York’s Hudson Valley. “It’s not progressive or moderate. It’s status quo or change. It’s for the people or for the elites.” <br> After a brutal winter, Democrats are beginning to show signs of life. The party won a crucial supreme court race in Wisconsin and picked up two seats in the Pennsylvania statehouse. In early April, roughly 4 million people attended more than 1,300 rallies across the U.S., demanding their leaders fight harder against Trump. The Fighting Oligarchy Tour, headlined by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has drawn hundreds of thousands of people across red states. The grassroots is sending a clear message to sitting Democrats: Do better, or we’ll replace you with people who will. <br> Most in the party recognize this is a crisis moment. But every crisis is also an opportunity - a chance to rethink policies, reframe messaging, and recruit new leaders who can meet the moment. The last time Democrats were this deep in the wilderness was in 2005, when few outside the DNC had heard of Barack Obama. Republicans’ own search for answers in the wake of Mitt Romney’s 2012 defeat gave rise to Trump. When you hit rock bottom, anything is possible - and every transformative political figure of the modern age has emerged from a moment like this one.<br> It’s a sunny Tuesday in early spring, and Jake Auchincloss is sitting on a bench outside the Rayburn House Office Building. Auchincloss, a 37-year old third-term Congressman from Massachusetts, seems nervous, almost jittery, as he explains why he thinks everybody is getting the Democrats’ problems wrong. “I hear a lot: ‘Get a leader, let’s rally behind somebody.’ And I strongly disagree with that,” Auchincloss told me. “The forest of ambition is large. There’s no shortage of presidential timber. I’m worried about the ideas.” This is what keeps Auchincloss up at night: “It’s that we are bereft of big ideas.”<br> Auchincloss has a few. He wants to offer free one-on-one tutoring to kids who are behind in school because of COVID-19, subsidize community-health clinics, and hold social media corporations accountable for what he calls the “attention fracking” of America’s youth. But a decade of fighting MAGA, he says, has “depleted some intellectual dynamism” from his party. “In 2028, we’d better be ready to have dynamic candidates on the stage offering whole new ideas,” he warns, “or we’ll lose again.”<br> In our conversations, Democrats often made that argument. It’s not enough to say what we’re against, they’d say, we have to say what we’re for. But when I asked these same party insiders what that should be, most regurgitated ideas Democrats have run on for decades. Protect Social Security and Medicare! Protect abortion rights! Protect labor! OK, I’d say. What about new ideas? They mentioned their own pet projects: a bill blocking a supermarket merger; a bill addressing specific veterans’ issues; a bill ensuring the right to fix your own car. Somehow, I had a hard time imagining “permitting reform!” as a rallying cry capable of mobilizing millions of low-information voters.<br> “I’ve heard some folks say, ‘It’s not our policies, we just have to communicate better,’” says Representative Angie Craig, who is running for an open Senate seat in Minnesota. “It actually is our policies that swing-state voters aren’t with us on. For those colleagues who were calling to defund the police: our voters are not with you on that.” <br> Most Democrats now acknowledge that the progressive movement encouraged a kind of purity politics that hampered the party’s ability to win majorities. “We swung the pendulum too far to the left,” says Representative Ritchie Torres, who represents a Bronx district where Trump made inroads with working-class people of color, as he did in cities around the country. “We have become more responsive to interest groups than to people on the ground.” <br> Many Democratic officials believe the party moved too far left on social issues in particular. “There are some sports where trans girls shouldn’t be playing against biological girls,” says one lawmaker, adding that most of his fellow Democrats agree but are “afraid of the blowback that comes from a very small community.” Even abortion is up for a rethink. Some Democrats want a retreat from the enthusiastic embrace of abortion rights, and a return to talking about abortion as “safe, legal, and rare,” as Bill Clinton put it. “Refusing to say that even in the third trimester there’s no limits on it, it’s not where the average American is,” says another Democratic lawmaker. “The really embarrassing truth is Donald Trump is closer to the median voting on abortion than Democrats were.” Yet the fact these lawmakers would only share these thoughts without their names attached shows how much Democrats still fear antagonizing their liberal base. <br> Others insisted that the problem is one of emphasis. When Democrats spent so much time talking about other things - Student debt! LGBTQ rights! Police reform! Climate change! - voters decided they’d taken their eye off the ball. “You’ve got to be principally seen worrying about jobs and people’s pay and health care - economic issues,” says Representative Chris Deluzio, who represents a working-class district in western Pennsylvania. “And I think folks see too many Democrats as not caring principally about the economy.” <br> This theory might make more sense if Harris had run a 2024 campaign that was all about trans kids, abortion, and gun safety. Harris didn’t run that campaign. She offered tax credits to boost small businesses, proposals to lower the cost of groceries and childcare, and the most comprehensive affordable-housing plan ever put forth by a presidential candidate. And she lost. “Kamala Harris was talking about it,” says Representative Greg Casar of Texas, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “But nobody was hearing it.”<br> Senator Ruben Gallego met me outside the Senate gym, still slightly damp. Gallego, who was raised by an immigrant single mother and served in the Marine Corps, was a rare bright spot for his party last year. He outperformed Harris by 8 points in Arizona, handily won Latino men, and was one of only two new Democrats to win Senate battleground races. As we walked through the Capitol, Gallego, 45, describes his very simple message: “I’m here to bring you more security: economic security, and your personal family security.” It meant talking constantly about the cost of living, and taking a more hard-line stance on immigration than most of his Democratic peers.<br> When we arrived at his hideaway - Gallego was so new to the Senate that he had forgotten his key - the freshman Senator told me he didn’t necessarily think other Democrats needed to adopt his security message. He just wants them to speak like normal people. The party’s problem is bigger than bad messaging, he believes. The problem is caution. “Democrats in general are always fearful of messing up,” he said. “The Democratic mindset has been to run very tight, not open campaigns.” <br> I knew what he was talking about. Aides on the Biden and Harris campaigns were so cautious they’d often go off the record just to provide canned talking points. That approach, Gallego says, is self-defeating in the age of social media, where crafting the perfect sound bite can mean missing the moment altogether. “I told my team during the campaign: This is a vibe election,” says Gallego. “If we can match the policy with creating this vibe, this culture, that’s gonna break through across all modes and mediums.” His point was that the art of messaging has changed. It’s less about developing the perfect slogan, and more about authenticity, simplicity, virality. The more consult-ified something sounds, the less memorable it is.<br> U.S. Congress<br> Gallego, at the Capitol on Jan. 9, is urging fellow Democrats to be less cautious and more authentic Francis Chung - POLITICO/AP<br> Like Gallego, many moderate Democrats have particular critiques of the party’s economic message. “I think Democrats have made this mistake of saying, ‘I’m here to help the little guy.’ Nobody wants to be called the little guy,” says Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, 36, who has won twice in a red district in Washington State. “The fatal mistake in politics is condescension.” She’s not the only Democrat who thinks the party erred by targeting their messaging to the most marginalized, rather than the vast, struggling middle class. Nearly 70% of voters in battleground districts think Democrats are “too focused on being politically correct,” according to brutal internal polling shared with top party leaders in March, while a majority think Democrats are not looking out for working people and are “more focused on helping other people than people like me.”<br> The focus on protecting the most vulnerable, in other words, has left many Americans feeling ignored. “I constantly get draft mailers in my office that say things like ‘Democrats are fighting so you could put food on the table.’ That is not aspirational,” says Mallory McMorrow, a Michigan state senator now running for U.S. Senate. To McMorrow, the Democratic message should be simple, universal, and optimistic: “Democrats fight for the American Dream,” she says. <br> Others believe the party has to emphasize a more populist pitch to counter Trump’s. “The Democratic Party needs to make as our central message that our goal is to break the unholy alliance between corporate greed and corrupt government,” Casar told me. “If somebody is more conservative than me on this social issue, or we may disagree on this foreign policy issue, at the end of the day people say: the Democratic Party puts me first and the billionaires last. And that’s what wins.”<br> One of the things that surprised me over the course of these conversations was the way a Sanders-style economic populism had gained traction with politicians not normally associated with the Sanders wing of the party. “Our economy is rigged because our government is rigged,” Chris Murphy told me. Democrats, he added, “have to wake up every morning thinking about how to unrig our government so that the corporations and the billionaires don’t always get what they want.” This was a man who stumped so hard for Hillary Clinton in 2016 that he was on a shortlist to be her VP. “I think it was a huge mistake for our party to view Bernie as some fringe threat to the party,” he says now. “Bernie’s message all along has been the crossover message, the message that appeals both to Democrats but also to a big element of Trump’s base.”<br> Five months ago, Kat Abughazaleh was an online journalist and researcher who made viral takedowns of far-right figures. But when she saw Democrats clapping politely during Trump’s second Inauguration, something snapped. “It was just so pathetic,” she told me, speaking on the phone from her home office in the Chicago suburbs. “I was like, ‘Well, maybe they’ll actually do something.’ And then they didn’t.”<br> Shortly afterwards, Abughazaleh, 26, announced a primary challenge to Representative Jan Schakowsky, an 80-year-old party stalwart who has served in Congress since the year Abughazaleh was born. Schakowsky wasn’t the worst member of Congress, Abughazaleh thought. They agreed on a lot of issues. But Abughazaleh thought Schakowsky wasn’t up to the moment. Her campaign announcement video asked a simple question: “What if we didn’t suck?” She raised more money in the campaign’s first week than Schakowsky did the entire first quarter. Within six weeks, Schakowsky announced she would not seek re-election. <br> Even if the Democrats generate new policy ideas and adopt a sharper pitch, they’ll still bump up against the core issue that tanked Biden, Harris, and much of the rest of the party last year: age. Many Democrats are finally realizing that too many of their leaders are too established, too out-of-touch, or simply too old to connect with voters.<br> TOPSHOT-US-POLITICS-DEMONSTRATION-GOVERNMENT<br> Trump opponents gather in Los Angeles on April 5 in one of more than 1,300 protests nationwide Etienne Laurent - AFP/Getty Images<br> Four House Democrats died in office over the past year. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has acknowledged that Republicans could not have passed a budget resolution in April had their narrow majority not been widened by the deaths of two members of his own caucus. Of the 30 House Democrats who are 75 or older, more than half told Axios they planned to run for re--election next year.<br> Many Democrats are not eager only for generational change. They want change at the top of the party as well. Some see Jeffries and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer as too deferential to established norms or too reluctant to use procedural powers to slow down Trump’s agenda. Both are underwater in public-opinion polls. Only 27% of Americans approve of congressional Democrats overall - the lowest number since CNN started asking in 2008. “I think the party is hyperfocused on message and forgetting about the messenger,” says Amanda Litman, the co-founder of Run for Something, which recruits new Democrats to run for office and supports them with training, mentorship, and campaign tools. “They’ve missed the way people consume information. You look for a person, not an institution.”A sclerotic party establishment has created a culture of waiting your turn. “All the people that are in formal leadership roles,” says Pat Ryan, “are ladder climbers, not leaders.”<br> At the DNC, Martin has locked horns with the party’s new vice chair, David Hogg, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland school shooting who rose to national prominence as a gun-safety activist. Hogg’s political organization, Leaders We Deserve, plans to invest $20 million to support young candidates challenging “asleep-at-the-wheel” Democrats in safe seats. Hogg tells me the party’s post-Biden “realignment” isn’t primarily about ideology. “It’s: Do you want to fight or do you want to roll over and die?” Martin has publicly rebuked Hogg, insisting the DNC maintain its long-standing position of neutrality. On May 12, the DNC’s credentials committee voted to void the elections of Hogg and another party official for procedural reasons they said predated the controversy, setting up the prospect of Hogg’s losing his position.<br> In the meantime, a new breed of Democrat is stepping up. They’re younger, more digitally fluent, more working class. They speak American without a D.C. accent. “People who haven’t been politicians for 30 years can go into a nonpolitical space and be a real person,” Amanda Litman told me as she walked to pick her children up from day care. These new candidates can talk persuasively about the costs of housing and childcare, issues that probably haven’t affected your life much if you’ve been in Congress since 1995. “It’s not the magic words,” says Litman. “It’s that many of these people can’t be credible messengers.”<br> Some new ones may emerge from the younger generation of Democrats who were elected in the 2018 wave after Trump’s first victory, and are now running statewide. Mallory McMorrow, 38, and Haley Stevens, 41, are vying for Michigan’s open Senate seat. Angie Craig, 53, is running for Senate in Minnesota. Abigail Spanberger, 45, is running for Governor of Virginia. Representative Mikie Sherrill, 53, is running for Governor of New Jersey. “The fight is generational,” Sherrill says. As soon as she arrived in Congress in 2019, she told me, she encountered an “entrenched” cohort of “collegial” lawmakers who -refused to update their strategic playbook because they kept waiting for politics to go back to the chummy inside game it had been pre-2016. “Do I think we need a new generation of leaders? Yes,” she told me. “But guess what: I think we’re about to get it.”<br> When Greg Casar arrived at the Tucson rally for Sanders’ and Ocasio-Cortez’s Fighting Oligarchy tour, the line of spectators stretched so long that Casar’s Uber driver thought he was going to a concert. Organizers had expected 2,000 people at a high school gymnasium; he said more than 10 times that many showed up. “People are even more opposed to what Donald Trump is doing than eight years ago,” Casar told me, fiddling with his AirPods as he sat outside a committee markup in late April. “But they want a new kind of leadership from the Democratic Party.”<br> As party leaders in Washington debate how to move forward, their grassroots base is sick of waiting for them to figure it out. Frustrated liberals have founded roughly 1,400 local Indivisible groups since the election, including more than 600 in GOP congressional districts. More than 46,000 young people have signed up to run for office through Run for Something since November. To those who participated in the “Resistance” movement of the first Trump term, the grassroots rage feels different this time. It’s not just targeted at Trump; it’s also focused on the feeble Democrats and spineless institutions who have failed to effectively resist him.<br> House Progressive Caucus Holds Capitol Hill Press Conference On Elon Musk&#39;s Government Interference<br> Casar, joined by fellow Progressive Caucus members, speaks on Elon Musk&#39;s government interference on Feb. 06 Kayla Bartkowski - Getty Images<br> Some Democratic officials have responded by copying Trump’s own playbook. They’re favoring nonpolitical podcasts over cable studios, burnishing their social-media game, showing up at football games and Coachella. They’re trying to worry less about who they’re offending and more about who they’re reaching. Group chats of -Democratic lawmakers are full of delicate negotiations on how best to respond to the Trump presidency. “We recognize that the most important thing we can do is make this guy unpopular,” says one lawmaker. They’re sharing talking points and legal strategies, while weighing various acts of defiance against the potential for distraction. Internal discussions, says this lawmaker, are laser-focused on “figuring out what’s tactically smarter.” <br> Most Democrats expect a public outcry against Trump’s policies will help them retake the House in 2026. Winning back the Senate will be tougher, with more Democrats on defense in battleground states. In the meantime, a shadow presidential primary is already taking shape, with hopefuls drawing different lessons from Trump’s win and its aftermath. California Governor Gavin Newsom has started a podcast, featuring Trump allies like Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk as guests, and pivoted to the center in his day job, cracking down on homeless encampments and pushing to reduce health care benefits for undocumented immigrants. Barnstorming against oligarchy helped Ocasio-Cortez raise $9.6 million in the first quarter of the year, rekindling speculation about her viability as a candidate for higher office. Cory Booker’s marathon Senate speech protesting Elon Musks’s cuts to the federal government was liked more than 350 million times on TikTok. And Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker railed against “do-nothing Democrats” in a speech in New Hampshire. As Pritzker put it: “The reckoning is finally here.” <br> Democrats are coming around to a new mantra: winning the argument is less important than winning elections. If the path to victory means embracing economic populism, they’ll do it. If they have to make room for new faces, then sayonara, old friends. If they need to tack to the center on some social issues, so be it. If winning requires doing more podcasts, or embracing Instagram influencers, or campaigning on permitting reform, they’ll give it a try. Because now that Democrats have seen what a second Trump presidency looks like, they’re relearning the lesson they should have known all along: only winning is winning.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R245" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">246</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3033px;left:-1px">HẠ VIỆN CỘNG HÒA TẠM QUA ẢI NGÂN SÁCH<br> Mãi tới đêm qua, Chủ Nhật, các dân biểu hữu trách trong Hạ Viện Cộng Hòa mới đạt thỏa thuận tạm về dự luật ngân sách theo tinh thần của Tổng thống Trump.

While Republicans, who have vowed to reduce red ink, say higher economic growth will fill the gap, budget analysts across the political spectrum have panned the Republican plan, warning that it worsens the U.S. fiscal picture.<br> The bill could reach the House floor this week, and it is a tenuous balance between the party’s tax-cut wing and factions seeking larger, quicker spending cuts.

Many spending hawks, meanwhile, backed the plan while groaning that it doesn’t go far enough fast enough. Others are holding out for more.<br> The measure stalled in the Budget Committee on Friday. The panel revoted late Sunday and advanced the measure 17-16, with four conservatives - Chip Roy (R., Texas), Ralph Norman (R., S.C.), Josh Brecheen (R., Okla.) and Andrew Clyde (R., Ga.) - voting present after voting no on Friday, allowing the bill to proceed.<br> Party leaders spent the weekend negotiating with lawmakers pushing in several directions, and talks continued late Sunday.<br> Conservative hard-liners such as Roy want accelerated spending cuts and quicker expirations of clean-energy tax breaks. He said on X after Sunday night’s vote that Medicaid work requirements will be accelerated but the measure doesn’t do enough to change the health program’s funding structure or cut off the energy tax credits. “We can and must do better before we pass the final product,” he said.<br> But lawmakers such as Rep. Jen Kiggans (R., Va.) are concerned that clean-energy breaks vanish too quickly. Rep. Nick LaLota (R., N.Y.), sought a higher top marginal income-tax rate to help pay for a larger state and local tax deduction.<br> FY2025&#39;30123$4 trillionCurrent deficit​projections<br> Deficit projections after​House GOP bill<br> Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) predicted on Fox News on Sunday morning that the package would pass the House ahead of leaders’ Memorial Day deadline. Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R., Texas) said late Sunday that negotiations are likely to continue right up until a floor vote.<br> “I couldn’t tell you what is in flux, what is fixed, what might change or not change,” Arrington said.<br> Moody’s Ratings, in downgrading the U.S.’s AAA rating on Friday, said it didn’t expect Congress to produce material multiyear spending or deficit reductions. Publicly held federal debt stands at about $29 trillion, nearly double the level when Trump and Republicans passed the 2017 tax law. Nearly $1 in every $7 the U.S. spends goes toward paying interest, more than the country spends on defense.<br> “While Republicans were campaigning on reducing spending and controlling the growth in the debt, once they put pen to paper, their real priorities demonstrate that they care a lot more about cutting taxes,” said Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy at the libertarian Cato Institute. <br> Longer-dated Treasury bond yields topped 5% on Monday morning, lifted by unease about U.S. government borrowing.<br> Republicans hear those concerns - and see the bill as a positive fiscal step. It prevents a 2026 tax increase they view as unacceptable and alters social-safety-net programs in ways that the last all-Republican government couldn’t achieve eight years ago. <br> White House budget director Russell Vought described the spending cuts as historic. <br> “It should not be lost on anyone, the degree to which it ends decades of fiscal futility and gets us winning again,” Vought wrote on X in a plea for fiscal hawks’ votes. <br> Rep. Jay Obernolte (R., Calif.), a Budget Committee member, said the Republican plan would unquestionably put the country on a stronger fiscal footing. <br> “If you have to pick between a higher-tax, higher-spending regime and a lower-tax, lower-spending regime, the latter is always better for economic growth,” he said. <br> Rep. Chip Roy at a House Budget Committee markup meeting.<br> Conservative hard-liners such as Rep. Chip Roy of Texas are seeking accelerated spending cuts.

Rural hospitals face closures,” said Rep. Becca Balint (D., Vt.). “And yet the very rich will get even richer at the expense of our children and grandchildren, who will shoulder the burden of that additional debt.”<br> In designing a partisan plan that increases budget deficits, Republicans are mindful about what happens if their bill falls apart. The alternate path to preventing a tax increase on most households would require a bipartisan coalition with Democratic votes. <br> Advertisement<br> That could further increase deficits. Democrats favor extending most tax cuts but would push to let tax cuts expire for top earners. They would, however, reject Republican spending cuts and seek extensions of expanded tax credits for purchasing health insurance. <br> Taxes and spending out of sync<br> Here’s the basic picture: The U.S. has a structural imbalance between taxes and spending, due to its aging population, spending increases, rounds of tax cuts and emergency programs during the 2008 financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. <br> Higher public debt can push up bond yields and interest rates and crowd out private investment. Bond yields are already much higher than in 2017 when Republicans passed their original tax-cut bill, pressuring lawmakers to be mindful of deficits. <br> If Congress does nothing, the country will borrow another $21 trillion from 2025 through 2034. That would increase publicly held debt as a share of gross domestic product to 117% from about 100%, topping the post-World War II high, according to the Congressional Budget Office. <br> Compared with that scenario, the Republican bill widens deficits by about 13%, reducing spending but lowering revenue by more. <br> The bill would cut taxes by nearly $4 trillion, compared with doing nothing. That includes extensions of expiring tax cuts and new temporary cuts to fulfill Trump’s campaign promises. It is partially offset by tax increases, including limits on top earners’ itemized deductions and clean-energy tax breaks. <br> Mike Johnson, Republican House Speaker from Louisiana, at the US Capitol.<br> House Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol on Thursday as Republicans worked on the legislation. Photo: Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg News<br> The GOP plan generates about $1.6 trillion in spending reductions and other deficit-reducing policies. Those include work requirements for Medicaid recipients, restrictions on nutrition assistance and student-loan changes. The bill includes several hundred-billion dollars in spending increases on border security, national defense and support for farmers. <br> Final official estimates aren’t available, but the total deficit effect is roughly $2.7 trillion compared with doing nothing and letting tax cuts expire, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The bill may change as Republicans maneuver it to Trump’s desk by July 4. <br> “On the horizon that investors care about, which is the first four years, it makes it worse,” said analyst Don Schneider of Piper Sandler. Still, he said, many spending cuts, including Medicaid changes, are real, indicating that Republicans are capable of restraining a major entitlement program. <br> Counting on growth<br> Republicans often argue that deficits won’t actually climb if the bill passes. They are counting on the bill’s tax cuts and Trump’s agenda of deregulation and oil-and-gas production to accelerate economic growth so much that extra tax revenue covers the costs. <br> Those claims, however, usually don’t include any drag from Trump’s tariffs, and economists say they are too optimistic about policies revving up the U.S. growth rate. <br> “Relying on economic growth has become the magic wand that Republicans are waving at any possible problem,” the Cato Institute’s Boccia said. <br> SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS<br> How concerned are you about the federal deficit? Join the conversation below.<br> Some Republicans say it is more realistic to assume expiring tax cuts get extended, then measure the bill after that $3.8 trillion adjustment. Viewed that way, the bill would reduce deficits.<br> However, the $2.7 trillion deficit increase likely underestimates potential budgetary effects. The legislation schedules popular tax cuts to expire after 2028, including extra boosts to the standard deduction and child tax credit and versions of Trump’s plans to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. <br> There will be political pressure to extend them and business tax breaks, just like today’s push for continuing expiring 2017 tax cuts. That would add $1.8 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. <br> “They assume the entire Trump agenda expires at that point, and that seems unlikely to me,” said Marc Goldwein, the group’s senior vice president. “The costs are front-loaded. That is the main driver.”<br> Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com<br> Copyright ©2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Là nghị sĩ cầm đầu đảng Dân Chủ tại Thượng viện, Schumer bất chấp sự thật, vẫn giữ thói đổ vấy cho đảng Cộng hòa hay Tổng thống Donald Trump về mọi sự và tưởng là cử tri sẽ tin. Chỉ còn 35% dân chúng tin vào tương lai của đảng Dân Chủ mà Schumer lại tái diễn sai lầm cũ, nhất là về chuyện cứ xảy ra tại thành phố New York của ông….<br> Dân Mỹ có một thành ngữ về trò gian đến trắng trợn là muốn bán một cây cầu cho người ta. Lần này, Nghị sĩ Schumer không lỡ một dịp may để nói nhảm, nên giáo sư Turley chỉ thẳng vào nơi chính hợp nhất: cây cầu Brooklyn của thành phố New York. <br> Tai nạn xảy ra khi một giang thuyền Mexico đụng vào thành cầu Brooklyn khiến hai người thiệt mạng, Nghị sĩ Schumer lập tức ra thông cáo đổ lỗi cho Chính quyền Trump. <br> Tức là Nghị sĩ trưởng khối Dân Chủ tại Thượng Viện lại rao bán cái cầu!<br> https://jonathanturley.org/.../and-i-have-a-bridge-in.../<br> And I Have a Bridge in Brooklyn to Sell You: Schumer Suggests that the Administration Caused the Mexican Ship Collision<br> (Jonathan Turley - Bizarre, Politics - May 19, 2025) <br> It has long been a practice for New York sharpies to scam chumps by offering to sell them the Brooklyn Bridge. However, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) tied an even harder scam in selling the idea on Sunday that the collision of the Mexican training ship Cuauhtémoc and the Brooklyn Bridge was the fault of the Trump Administration. Schumer appears to have missed the boat, literally, given the immediate reports of a loss of navigation ability on the vessel. In any case, the suggestion that cuts in staffing led to the crash is just the latest Democratic spin that dispenses with any factual foundation.<br> Democratic members have been actively spreading unfounded claims from the start of the Administration that tragedies were caused by reductions in staff or programs. That included blaming the Administration for a crash that occurred less than 24 hours after the new FAA commissioner took office as well as a crash in Canada due to bad weather. It simply does not matter if the claims are factually absurd. Democrats are rarely accused of disinformation and rely on a generally enabling legacy media.<br> The same pattern emerged after the blackout at Newark in a system that was flagged as antiquated during the Biden Administration and should have been replaced years ago. Despite only being in office for just over 100 days, the Democrats blamed the Trump Administration for the system failure.<br> Schumer pushed some of those earlier false claims. However, his gambit with the Brooklyn Bridge would embarrass the most hardened Brooklyn Bridge-selling grifter.<br> Unwilling to let any tragedy go to waste, the Democratic minority leader issued a press release declaring<br>  “We know there has been meddling by the Trump administration into USCG staffing, and we need to know how this might have impacted the events of last night - from a command, communication and local coordination level. There are indications that this service [Vehicle Traffic System] may not be fully or adequately functional in light of a hiring freeze. If this were the case, the Brooklyn Bridge accident would be a national harbinger, demanding immediate attention.”<br> However, there is no such connection or allegation in the accident that killed two sailors and injured 17 others.<br> The Coast Guard was obviously not amused. It issued its own press release Sunday that said that it immediately responded to the scene of the deadly collision:<br>  “Sector New York immediately launched a crew from Coast Guard Station New York to the scene and established a safety zone from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Manhattan Bridge. New York Vessel Traffic Services suspended commercial traffic in the area.”<br> President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency eliminated its Logistics Information Management System, which managed configuration, maintenance, supply chain and technical data. It was viewed as ineffective and the cut saved over $32 million. It had nothing to do with the accident.<br> The hair-trigger attacks after these tragedies only deepen the public’s distrust. Polling shows that the public’s confidence in Democrats in Congress is at a record low of 25%.<br> On the day of Schumer’s comment, a new poll from the Associated Press (AP) and NORC at the University of Chicago found that only 35 percent of Democrats are optimistic about the party’s future.<br> That makes sense when your Senate minority leader is trying to sell the public a bridge story that treats them like moronic marks who will buy anything.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R247" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">248</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:4512px;left:-1px">KHI THẨM PHÁN TỐI CAO PHÁP VIỆN LÀ CÁN BỘ SÁCH ĐỘNG…<br> Khi giới luật sư nêu vấn đề là khẩu khí đã sai, chúng ta có thêm một trường hợp, do Giáo sư Jonathan Turley trình bày với quý vị mà khỏi qua phiên âm hoặc sự sấu xa trong Thánh Kinh:... <br> https://jonathanturley.org/.../courting-controversy.../...<br> Courting Controversy: Justices’ Side Commentaries Undermine the Supreme Court<br> (Jonathan Turley - Columns, Constitutional Law, Courts - May 19, 2025)<br> Below is my column in The Hill on the controversy this month over extrajudicial comments made by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. These are only the latest such comments by justices that became distractions during the discussion of pending cases before the Court.<br> Here is the column:<br> This month, the crowd at the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture was electrified as a speaker called on the lawyers in the audience to “fight this fight” and declared, “We can’t lose the battles we are facing.”<br> What was particularly thrilling was that the declaration of “act of solidarity” was not coming from a Democratic member of Congress or an MSNBC host, but from Associate Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.<br> There was a day when such a speech would have been scandalous for a sitting justice of the Supreme Court. For much of the court’s history, justices avoided public speaking beyond the perfunctory commencement speech or circuit judicial conference. The tradition was that justices would limit comments on major issues to their written opinions, so as to avoid any question of partisanship or bias against litigants. It was considered a cost of being one of nine.<br> That tradition, however, was shattered in the 20th century by what I once called the “rise of the celebrity justice.” Despite my respect for them, I was critical of the late Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who seemed to relish appearances before ideologically supportive groups, discussing not only issues that might come before the court, but also making comments in books and speeches on political issues.<br> The troubling trend has created the impression of justices maintaining constituencies on the left and the right. The adoration and attention can have a corrosive effect on a jurist caught up in the moment. Previously, Sotomayor was criticized when she directly called for political action from young law students to defend abortion rights.<br> Sotomayor acknowledged, “I am pointing out to that when I shouldn’t because they tell me I shouldn’t.” However, she criticized a recent decision of the court from which she had dissented and chastised her conservative colleagues who “have opted to bury their heads in the sand.” She added, “You know, I can’t change Texas’ law but you can and everyone else who may or may not like it can go out there and be lobbying forces in changing laws that you don’t like.”<br> Sotomayor’s latest comments came shortly before the hearing in the birthright citizenship case, where the court has been asked to rein in district courts imposing national or universal injunctions against the Trump administration. Sotomayor’s sharp questioning of the solicitor general drew a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, who asked if the other justices could be allowed to hear the counsel’s answers.<br> The hearing also highlighted the public comments of another justice on the very matter before the Court. In 2022, when President Biden faced a fraction of the injunctions imposed against Trump, Justice Elena Kagan publicly condemned the use of universal injunctions in an interview at Northwestern University School of Law. She lashed out at the obvious “forum shopping” to get before favorable courts and said “It just cannot be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years it takes to go through the normal [appellate] process.” She added, “You look at something like that and you think, that can’t be right.”<br> Now, in the Trump administration, Kagan has a case that can right that wrong by requiring parties to certify a national class action if they want a national injunction. However, Kagan raised some eyebrows by quickly stating that “this case is very different” and then suggesting that there was a need for national injunctions against Trump.<br> As Solicitor General John Sauer tried to distinguish between the procedural question before the Court from the merits (which have not been fully briefed), Kagan and Sotomayor insisted that the unconstitutionality was clear. Kagan snapped “Every court is ruling against you.”<br> Kagan’s rationale was as disturbing as her apparent reversal. The merits of the birthright citizenship order are still being briefed in lower courts. Moreover, district courts have reasonably concluded that they are bound by prior Supreme Court decisions. The administration believes that those cases are wrong or wrongly interpreted. Most of us expected the Administration to lose in the lower courts before the issue can be raised with the Supreme Court.<br> And frankly, it will likely lose on the merits there as well. However, that was not the issue before the justices this week. The issue was whether, as a constitutional matter, district courts can bind an entire nation in resolving a case or must confine relief to the parties before it.<br> The Trump administration is not arguing that courts can never issue universal injunctions. Rather, it is arguing that one must establish a national class action in order to demand a national injunction from a district court. The process under Rule 23 of the federal rules includes tests for determining whether parties in a given case truly represent the interests of other similarly situated individuals.<br> Kagan and her liberal colleagues insisted that, even though they were not looking at the merits of the birthright citizenship case, they could take a “peek” at what Trump was trying to do. Kagan suggested that Trump’s birthright citizenship order was clearly unconstitutional and thus may warrant a national injunction even if other controversies might not.<br> Some of us believe that a court’s authority to issue injunctions should not change based on justices taking a peek ahead at the ultimate merits in a case. Kagan’s comments raised questions of whether an injunction “can’t be right” if a greater percentage of courts disagreed on the merits.<br> Putting aside how the Supreme Court will rule in the case (which is unclear), the controversy leading into the argument over Kagan’s earlier comments shows the perils of such public speeches. Kagan raised interesting concerns over ending such injunctions, but those points became enmeshed with her prior public positions. Her effort to distinguish the case led to claims that she was spinning a case to conform with her public commentary.<br> Sotomayor and Kagan have made many speeches that have uplifting messages for law students and lawyers alike, including some of the comments in these events. They are both worthy role models for all lawyers. However, these public comments are not a model for jurists, in my view. The controversies this week are only the latest examples of the costs to the court itself in justices holding forth on political subjects or issues that may come before them.<br> During the week of these controversies, another figure, retired Justice David Souter, passed away. One of the things I most respected in Souter was not only his modesty and civility but his reticence in making public comments. He spoke through his opinions and left the rest for others to debate.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R248" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">249</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3133px;left:-1px">AXIOS và BÀI ĐẦU TUẦN KÉM VUI VỀ KINH TẾ<br>Tổng hợp rất chuyên nghiệp của Mike Allen trên Bloomberg:<br>Sau khi đọc, xin chia sẻ nội dung với các bạn thật. <br>Cám ơn T.<br>https://fee.org/articles/falling-for-socialism/... <br>All Commentary - Saturday, May 17, 2025 - Institute for Economic Affairs Zoning Laws - Falling for Socialism<br>___ <br>Gen Z’s rage should be against cronyism, not capitalism. Across college campuses, on TikTok feeds, and in everyday conversations, a familiar narrative is gaining steam: capitalism is broken.<br>Rising rents and stagnant wages fuel the claim among some young people that free markets have failed an entire generation. According to a 2024 poll by the Institute of Economic Affairs, more than 60% of young Britons now view socialism favorably. In the United States, the trend is similar, with Generation Z increasingly skeptical of capitalism’s promises.<br>But much of this idealism is rooted in distance - many of the young people romanticizing socialism have never lived through the economic dysfunction or political repression it often brings. For those who experienced Soviet shortages, Venezuelan collapse, or East Germany’s surveillance, the word socialism doesn’t suggest fairness or opportunity - it suggests fear, failure, and control. There’s a reason so many fled those systems to come to freer countries. What sounds utopian in theory has too often turned dystopian in practice.<br>But blaming capitalism misses the mark. The real culprit is cronyism, the unholy alliance between big government and big business that twists markets, blocks competition, and rewards political connections over genuine innovation.<br>The Myth of Market Failure<br>Capitalism, in its true form, is based on voluntary exchange. It rewards businesses that meet people’s needs and wants, with consumers deciding what succeeds and what fails. Competition drives improvement, innovation, and lower prices. No one is forced to buy or sell anything; choice reigns.<br>Cronyism is a different beast altogether. In a crony system, businesses succeed not by serving customers but by lobbying politicians. Profits come through subsidies, bailouts, and regulations designed to crush competition.<br>The 2008 financial crisis, often cited as proof of capitalism’s failures, actually showcased what happens when markets are rigged. Reckless banks, instead of collapsing as they deserved, were bailed out with taxpayer money. Ordinary people lost jobs and homes, while the politically connected survived and thrived.<br>This wasn’t free enterprise. It was cronyism.<br>The COVID-19 pandemic provided a grim sequel. Small businesses were forced to shut their doors under government mandates. Meanwhile, corporate giants like Amazon, able to operate under looser restrictions or pivot online, soared to record profits. Policies, written in the name of public health, often privileged the biggest players while leaving Main Street devastated.<br>Cronyism on Both Sides of the Atlantic<br>Cronyism is not limited to one country or one political party. Across the United States and Europe, the symptoms are the same.<br>In the US, Canada, and the UK, the dream of homeownership slips further away for young people. Sky-high housing prices are blamed on “market failure,” but the real cause lies in layers of government-imposed barriers: restrictive zoning laws, burdensome permitting requirements, and endless bureaucratic delays. Big developers who can afford to navigate or influence the system survive. Everyone else gets locked out.<br>In Europe, the pattern repeats. France’s labor laws, designed to protect workers, instead stifle opportunity. Hiring becomes risky and expensive, especially for young people. Large corporations, with the resources to manage compliance costs, consolidate their dominance. Small firms and startups never get off the ground.<br>There’s also a persistent myth that big business fears government intervention. In reality, the largest corporations often embrace it, because it keeps them on top. Tech giants like Facebook and Google now lobby for more regulation, knowing that complex new rules will strangle smaller competitors who can’t afford fleets of compliance officers. Green energy subsidies, meant to combat climate change, often end up showering billions on well-connected firms while locking out emerging innovators.<br>Cronyism doesn’t reward the best ideas. It rewards the best lobbyists.<br>Why Gen Z’s Frustration Is Justified<br>Gen Z values fairness, creativity, and freedom. The very principles cronyism undermines. When political influence matters more than merit, and when success depends on government favoritism instead of consumer satisfaction, opportunity shrinks and innovation slows. But they are wrong when they think “socialism” would be a better option, not least because of the rampant cronyism that has existed in every socialist state.<br>The temptation to seek salvation through government power is not new. The Soviet Union began with a promise of equality and delivered oppression and scarcity (except for the party elites). Venezuela promised 21st-century socialism and delivered hunger, economic collapse, and political repression. Meanwhile, countries that embraced market freedom—even imperfectly—created unparalleled prosperity. Free markets have lifted billions out of poverty, and unleashed innovation that reshaped the modern world.<br>Markets aren’t flawless. But they leave the door open for anyone to succeed, not just those born into privilege or connected to power.<br>Aim Your Anger at the Right Target<br>Gen Z’s frustration is real, and it deserves an outlet. But the answer is not to tear down capitalism; it’s to tear down cronyism. A freer, fairer future depends on separating business from political power, not binding them closer together. It means ending corporate welfare, simplifying the rules of the game, and making sure that competition, not connections, decides who wins.<br>The fight for fairness is worth waging. But it must be aimed in the right direction. If we rage against cronyism, not capitalism, we can build a future where innovation thrives, opportunity is real, and every member of Generation Z has a genuine chance to rise.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R249" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">250</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3813px;left:-1px">AXIOS và BÀI ĐẦU TUẦN KÉM VUI VỀ KINH TẾ<br>Tổng hợp rất chuyên nghiệp của Mike Allen trên Bloomberg:<br>https://www.axios.com/.../axios-am-704c7670-342c-11f0...<br>(Axios AM - By Mike Allen - May 19, 2025) <br>Good Monday morning.

Go deeper.<br>***<br>1 big thing: Trump&#39;s tariff reality<br>Illustration: Lazaro Gamio/Axios<br>The Trump administration conceded this weekend what economists, CEOs and consumers long knew: Americans pay for tariffs, Axios managing editor for business Ben Berkowitz writes.Why it matters: Nearly a decade of Trump trade arguments held that foreign countries, not Americans, paid the ultimate cost of a trade war. But the president and his economic team now acknowledge that tariffs are raising prices for everyone, from industrial ports to retail storefronts.<br>🖼️ The big picture: Trump&#39;s sweeping global tariffs, effectively the highest in nearly a century, are expected to cost the average household more than $2,300 a year, according to the Yale Budget Lab.Even companies that once promised to hold the line on those costs, including Walmart, now say they have no choice but to pass them along.Inflation may be benign for now. But experts are increasingly convinced that higher prices are only a matter of time.<br>🛒 After Walmart said this week it would raise prices, a furious Trump insisted on Truth Social on Saturday that the company &quot;eat the tariffs&quot; - a concession that someone this side of the border had to pay something, somehow.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent then went on Sunday shows yesterday and said that while Walmart would eat some of the tariffs, consumers would have to pay, too.The intrigue: It was only May 11 that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted people had to drop the &quot;silly arguments&quot; that consumers would pay the costs of trade levies.Four days later, the country&#39;s largest retailer said that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;d have to do.<br>🛣️  Between the lines: Bessent said yesterday that while consumer prices may rise due to tariffs, people will see even bigger benefits from the falling price of gasoline.He argued it was effectively a tax cut for consumers, and would help keep inflation in line.<br>🥊 Reality check: With the average American vehicle using a little under 500 gallons of gas a year, and gas prices per gallon being a little over 40¢ cheaper today than a year ago, the average driver is looking at an annual savings of around $200 per car. That&#39;s a fraction of what budget experts estimate tariffs will cost households.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R250" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">251</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3533px;left:-1px">KHÔNG CHỈ BIDEN – CẢ TÒA BẠCH CUNG BỊ UNG THƯ!<br>Mà là ung thư tử cung nằm ở trên đầu, nên chúng khép đùi đẻ ra toàn chuyện láo nhưng được báo chí gia nô ca tụng là sáng suốt.

He stared at people he had known for decades, including George Clooney, like he’d never seen them before. His top advisers hid him from his own staff. Cabinet members realized that the president could not be relied upon to respond to an emergency that came at an inconvenient hour.<br>Original Sin, the new book by CNN host Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson, is all Washington can talk about right now. Although its official release isn’t until Tuesday, there have been enough previews and excerpts for everyone to know what it says: that the decision by Biden’s top aides to keep his cognitive decline a secret was an enormous scandal. Perhaps even the biggest political scandal of the 21st century.<br>The book provides jaw-dropping details about our slack-jawed former president and the people who tried - and failed - to deliver for him another four years in office, even though he was obviously incapable of doing the job. Yet these are bombshell revelations of a strange sort. They are vivid and enraging, but fundamentally unsurprising.<br>That’s because they confirm what most normal Americans - and indeed everyone who has ever known an elderly person - instinctively understood was happening behind closed doors. They could see with their own eyes that the president was losing his mental faculties.<br>Anyone who still doubts that should listen to the audio from Biden’s October 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, which Axios published on Friday. It makes Hur’s assessment of Biden as “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” seem generous.<br>Taken together, the book and the audio are a reminder that for 2023 and most of 2024, an elaborate play was staged for the American people. The production was brought to you by some of the most powerful people in the country. The First Lady and senior White House aides wrote the script.<br>Cabinet members and governors and senators and the legacy press all dutifully played their parts. Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg made it as slick a show as possible. Steven Spielberg helped with the lighting.<br>The conceit at the heart of it all: that Joe Biden was “sharp as a tack,” not only fit to serve as president at that moment, but the best choice to lead the country for another four years, until January 2029, when he would be 86.<br>It was an audacious, disgraceful stunt. Yet it was the strangest of “cover-ups,” given that Biden’s decline was a publicly observable reality - despite how determined the press seemed to discredit the idea.<br>But Americans could not be fooled.<br>Less than a year into his presidency, in November 2021, just 46 percent of voters said they thought he was mentally fit for the job. By September 2023, about three-quarters of Americans - including a majority of Democrats - had major concerns about his age and its impact on his ability to serve as president. That was before Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips announced a primary challenge on the grounds that Biden was too old, in the fall of 2023. It was before Hur published his damning report in February 2024. And before the June debate appearance that ended his candidacy.<br>The Biden story is less Watergate and more “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” The president’s courtiers indulged the fiction; the townspeople weren’t buying it. Why did the people with White House passes insist on, and in some cases genuinely believe, something that the rest of us could see was a fiction?<br>Because the Bidens have endured crisis after crisis - whether that’s Beau’s terminal brain cancer, which they were less than honest about at the time, or Hunter’s addiction - by building a narrative and living within it.<br>That’s where the press should come in, including, it must be noted, CNN and Jake Tapper himself. Tapper has wisely fessed up, saying that he looks back on his reporting of Biden’s health with “humility,” admitting that his coverage of the issue was “not enough.” It’s not just that the most powerful media companies and characters ignored it. Some went to great lengths to dismiss and deride criticisms of Biden. They even coined the term “cheap fakes” to discredit edited clips of Biden looking old and out of it. Even though he was, in fact, both of those things.<br>“The original sin of Election 2024 was Biden’s decision to run for re-election,” write Tapper and Thompson, but reading their book one is left angry not at Biden but at self-serving aides, cowardly Democratic elites, and - especially - a media who conveniently forgot their role in the democratic process.<br>What Original Sin, the Hur audio, and the Democrats answering questions about Biden’s mental decline in recent weeks all make clear is that we’ve barely scratched the surface of this scandal - perhaps the biggest political scandal of the 21st century so far.<br>The outstanding questions fall into two buckets: medical and constitutional. The most important in the first category: Was there any kind of diagnosis? In late February 2024, The New York Times published a story saying that Biden’s doctor described him as “fit for duty” after a physical and neurological exam. The Hur report had been issued three weeks earlier, yet the fact that the White House “declined to give specifics about the tests Mr. Biden had undergone” raised no questions for the Times.<br>Earlier, Josh Marshall, the editor in chief of Talking Points Memo, described Hur as having “totally slimed Biden” with his report. Most of the press agreed. As for Tapper, in October 2020, he accused Lara Trump of “mocking his stutter” when she suggested Biden was suffering from cognitive decline. When she continued to press her point, he cut off the interview. (Tapper’s co-author, Axios’s Alex Thompson, was one of the few mainstream reporters who wrote about Biden’s mental acuity before the infamous June debate.)<br>Shortly after the debate, one emeritus professor of neurology told The Free Press he believed Biden “had Parkinsonism.” Tapper and Thompson quote neurologists saying something similar. Had the president just lost a step, as his doctor claimed in 2024, or did he have a more serious problem that was not being disclosed? We deserve an answer to that question. We still do not have one.<br>The most pressing question in the second bucket: Who was running the country?<br>Administration staffers referred to Biden’s close-knit team of top advisers as The Politburo. It’d be a funny joke were it not so accurate a description of how America was being governed. Here’s how one insider described how decisions were made in the Biden administration: “Five people were running the country, and Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board.” One top official said: “I’ve never seen a situation like this before, with so few people having so much power.”<br>Meanwhile, cabinet meetings were literally scripted, one cabinet member told Tapper and Thompson.<br>Was the president the decision-maker? Yes, said another. “but if the inner circle is shaping them in such a way, is it really a decision? Are they leading him to something?”<br>“For months we didn’t have access to him,” complained another cabinet secretary. “There was clearly a deliberate strategy by the White House to have him meet with as few people as necessary.”<br>These accounts suggest the possibility that the Biden scandal was nothing less than a subversion of American democracy. It deserves much more thorough investigation and scrutiny than it has so far received.<br>Most of the Democratic establishment sources who provided the material for Original Sin - and Tapper and Thompson have clearly spoken to a lot of very powerful Democrats - show little sign of grasping any of this. Instead they offer self-exculpatory variations of: This is crazy, I thought to myself as I left the fundraiser. And when they lament their party’s mistake, they are overwhelmingly focused on the fact that Biden’s decision to hide his cognitive decline cost them the White House; though he finally ceded to Kamala Harris, she could never recover from America’s anger at the deception.<br>But very few of the Democrats Tapper and Thompson interviewed seem to care whether Biden could do it for another term, and what it meant to be publicly supporting someone so ill-equipped for the role. For far too many, the biggest problem with the Weekend at Bernie’s ruse was simply that they hadn’t gotten away with it.<br>The specter of Donald Trump explains so much of this bad behavior. Time and again, Trump was invoked as the justification for quashing dissent, rewriting the primary rules, or silencing inconvenient voices.<br>The Democrats were frozen in panic at the prospect of a second Trump term. They couldn’t do what any sane party would do and move on from Biden when there was still time to do so properly. And that inaction led to exactly the outcome they so feared.<br>And yet Biden’s top aides had a strange cognitive dissonance with regard to Trump. One minute they insist that Biden alone is capable of defeating him. Thompson and Tapper report that after former Obama campaign chief and CNN talking head David Axelrod went public with his worries about Biden’s age, he got an angry call from Biden’s then chief of staff, Ron Klain, who asked: “Who else is going to do this, Axe?... Who’s going to beat Trump? President Biden is the only one who has done it.’ ”<br>The argument flipped a year later, when top aides were overriding any concerns about Biden’s age by emphasizing his opponent’s weakness, including the possibility he could go to prison. Yes, the sentiment in the White House, from the very people who positioned themselves as defenders of American democracy, appears to have been something like: Don’t worry about the president’s senility. The opposition leader will be behind bars soon.<br>With Biden out of office and his decline undeniable - on Sunday, a spokesperson announced the 82-year-old former president has been diagnosed with prostate cancer - Democrats would clearly rather be talking about something else. But changing the subject would be a mistake. A reckoning over this embarrassing scandal is overdue and necessary. Any Democrat who wants to do something about the party’s historically low favorability ratings won’t get very far without one.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R251" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">252</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3713px;left:-1px">SỐNG TRONG MỘT NỀN DÂN CHỦ THÌ..

(Photo by Kena Betancur / AFP via Getty Images)<br>(By James Fallows - The Free Press - 05.18.25 - U.S. Politics)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Here are quick answers to questions I keep receiving about air travel. To start with the most basic on today’s 10-question list:<br>1) Should I worry about a flight through Newark?<br>If the worry is about safety, no. Anything can happen, but anything can happen each time you get out of bed.<br>If the worry is about delays, or a tight connection, or close timing for a big event, yes. Make other plans.<br>United Airlines has already substantially cut back its schedule for its Newark hub. Use it as an example.<br>2) Why should I worry about one thing and not the other?<br>The two answers - don’t worry about safety, do worry about delay -have the same origin: an immediate “better safe than sorry” mindset in the aviation system.<br>Precisely because the U.S. air travel system has just been through its worst air disaster in decades (the collision of a Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet over the Potomac on January 29, 2025), and has ongoing problems in Newark and elsewhere, it is even more safety-focused than usual. As a result it is avoiding some routine shortcuts, and instead taking things extra slow. In practice this amounts to added spacing everywhere: between planes as they taxi, between takeoffs and landings, among planes in cruise and approach, and in other ways.<br>The aviation world is full of mantras on how you travel fastest when you do not rush. In aviation that means: Be hyperdeliberate about checklists, even though you could recite all steps in your sleep. Double-check any clearance or instruction unless you’re absolutely sure. Think ever more carefully about what you’ll do the next time systems go down. It’s the airborne equivalent of waiting for a school crossing guard before stepping onto a road, even when everything looks clear. For the foreseeable future, U.S. aviation will be in crossing-guard mode.<br>3) Why is this happening?<br>The main reason is that we’re at one of the predictable - and long-predicted - failure points at the intersection of economics, politics, human nature, technological progress, and environmental constraints.<br>The intersecting forces, all brought to light by Newark, include:<br>— “Limits to growth” in air travel: There are only so many runways at the biggest airports in the biggest cities, and only so many airplanes that can land at a given time. That’s a physical limit at odds with travelers’ demands to get to popular places at convenient times. Thus approach corridors for hub airports resemble the road traffic below them. Landing at Los Angeles International Airport at 5:00 p.m. becomes like driving on “the 405” at that time. Approaches to the big East Coast airports from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, to Boston Logan International Airport become like I-95 that connects them.<br>In 1997, the renowned writer and aviator William Langewiesche wrote a major story in The Atlantic Monthly that said: “The most pressing issue that air-traffic controllers face is a surge in air traffic without a commensurate expansion of runway availability.”<br>When Langewiesche wrote that story, airline travel had nearly doubled since Jimmy Carter deregulated the industry in the 1970s. And in the subsequent 28 years, daily flights have nearly doubled again, while the number of hub-airport runways has barely changed.<br>— Chronic problems with public infrastructure: Everyone wants better roads - and bridges, tunnels, airports, and rail systems. No one wants to live with the long, slow process of creating them. Or paying for them. These infrastructure projects are far less glamorous counterparts to building the European cathedrals. Completing them spans decades - but political mood and leadership are quicksilver.<br>— Mismatch in tech mindsets: Commercial technology keeps leaping ahead because it can operate on the “we’ll try it in beta” mindset. Move fast and break things; learn from what goes wrong. Life-and-death systems can’t use the public as a beta-test audience. That’s why aviation technology, in particular, will always be a generation behind the latest commercial versions. It’s why the system at the heart of the Newark blackout is only now moving from “copper wire” landline-era connections to the fiber-optic networks familiar in business and consumer systems for decades.<br>— Human nature, which shows up as a mismatch in the supply of talent: As you may have heard, being an air traffic controller can be stressful. Getting, training, and keeping enough controllers has been a challenge in the 44 years since Ronald Reagan fired more than 11,000 striking controllers at once when they refused to return to work. In its final year, the Biden administration bucked a long-term trend by exceeding its hiring targets.<br>4) Didn’t anyone see this coming?<br>Everyone did. Again to use my friend William Langewiesche as an example, in 1997 he laid out the problem, in a piece focused on . . . Newark!<br>    Of the several thousand airplanes aloft during a typical daytime rush, most are headed for the same few cities. . . . This is not merely because those places are where people want to go but also because to stay competitive, airlines need efficient route structures centered on hubs - the now-familiar passenger-exchange airports that by their very nature increase the number of takeoffs and landings.<br>More recently, the most prescient advance-warning coverage I’ve seen is by reporter Will Guisbond, in an aviation-specialist, expensive-subscription-only site called The Air Current. A year ago he was warning about most of what is going wrong in Newark now. The point is: These problems have taken no one in aviation by surprise.<br>5) Okay, but why Newark, and why now?<br>The short answer involves a name that is becoming famous in aviation, “N90.” That is the New York area air traffic control center in charge in charge of traffic flow for the major airports, including Newark, and smaller ones in the region.<br>As part of a yearslong process approved during Donald Trump’s first term, the Newark part of N90 operations center was physically relocated from Long Island to Philadelphia in 2024. The supposed goal was to cut living expenses for controllers, and thus attract more of them. The counterargument was that the move wouldn’t pay off because not enough people would want to relocate. Also, that it would be technologically fragile, and prone to failures like the ones that have now occurred.<br>There’s a tremendous amount more of this history I’m skipping over. Although Trump officials now fall over themselves to blame Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg for screwing up the implementation, the reality is that, like other serious U.S. problems, the responsibility is shared and decades old.<br>Everything You Want To Know About the Air Travel Mess . . .<br>Commercial Jet Aircraft on Final Approach for landing at San Diego Lindbergh Field. (Photo by Bob Riha, Jr./Getty Images)<br>6) Is the Newark problem spreading?<br>In the greater New York area, yes. My pilot chat boards are full of people talking about ripple-effect delays and cancellations throughout nearby “reliever” airports. These are the likes of Teterboro in New Jersey, White Plains in New York, and many smaller ones throughout the region.<br>To return to the freeway analogy, it’s like “surface roads” in New York or Los Angeles getting jammed, as people avoid gridlock on the freeways.<br>7) Will it spread across the country?<br>In exactly the way it’s happened in Newark, probably not. That is because no other major terminal radar approach control (TRACON) facility has been moved. The two-minute radio transmitter failure in Denver, Colorado, last week appears to be a completely unrelated event.<br>But all the other pressure points are nationwide. Delays in one area soon mean delays everywhere else.<br>😎 ‘Who is to blame?’<br>The right thing for me to do at this point would be to skip my standard list of things that Trump, Elon Musk, DOGE, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have done through these past months to erode the air-safety system.<br>If I weren’t skipping the list, it would include:<br>-   Firing FAA employees<br>-   Immediately blaming the Potomac disaster on DEI policies<br>-   Supporting the DOGE assaults on the agencies that keep aviation safe, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service<br>-  Considering a sweetheart deal to switch the FAA’s controller-modernization system from a longstanding Verizon contract to Elon Musk’s Starlink<br>But, as Richard Nixon once put it, “that would be wrong” - that is, to rehash these issues.<br>So I’ll promise to retire this list -  if the Trump-Musk-Duffy team can retire their reflexive claims that everything is Joe Biden’s fault. This genuinely is an all-of-us problem.<br>9) Can this ever get better?<br>Yes. Slowly. Think of every other structural problem in U.S. life: housing patterns; land transport; regional imbalances in opportunity, education, and medical care. They’ve evolved through the decades, and can’t be resolved overnight.<br>And think of the structural achievements in American life. The intercontinental railroads of the mid-19th century. The road system of the early 1900s. The interstates of the mid-20th century. The development of airports and air travel. The spread of telephones and radio and TV and then the internet.<br>All of these involved public-private collaborations. All were imperfect, uneven, often unfair in their benefits. But each was indispensable to the nation’s growth. And all were decades-long in gestation.<br>I try to avoid homilies on the need to be more “bipartisan.” The homily I use instead involves William James’s seminal essay from 1910, “The Moral Equivalent of War.” And the eternal challenge in American politics, as highlighted in that essay, is to do something good for the country, without tying it to an external enemy or threat. That’s part of what we’re dealing with here.<br>10) What can I personally, as a traveler, do?<br>Be patient. That is all. But it’s important. Air travel is going to be slower. And for long trips it’s still pretty fast.<br>In our family we have a saying, which probably originated after a tedious day at the DMV: “Take a book, it’ll be pleasant.”<br>Take a book. Watch a movie. Zen out. Better safe (and slow) than sorry.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R252" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">253</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3533px;left:-1px">MẠNG LƯỚI QUỐC TẾ ĐẦU ĐỘC NƯỚC MỸ<br>Lãnh đạo cơ quan FBI điều trần: dù đã ngăn chặn tại biên giới miền Nam, Hoa Kỳ vẫn bị làn sóng fentanyl đầu độc!

So where&#39;s all the fentanyl coming from? Still? Where&#39;s the trafficking coming from still? Where are all the narco traffickers going to keep bringing this stuff into the country? The northern border. Our adversaries have partnered up with the CCP and others - Russia, Iran - on a variety of different criminal enterprises. And they&#39;re going and they&#39;re sailing around to Vancouver and coming in by air.”<br>Patel asserted that adversarial regimes - including Beijing and Tehran - are now working in tandem on “a variety of different criminal enterprises,” and exploiting what he called the “sheer tyranny of distance” on America’s northern frontier, where vast terrain and lax enforcement in Canada have allegedly enabled fentanyl pipelines and terrorist infiltration.<br>Pointing directly at Carney’s government, Patel continued:<br>“Now we&#39;re focused on it and we&#39;re calling our state and local law enforcement partners up [at the northern border]. But you know, who has to get to step in is Canada - because they&#39;re making it up there and shipping it down here.”<br>The FBI director’s warning - posted on the White House’s X account - follows exclusive reporting by The Bureau and a newly released 2025 threat assessment from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which, for the first time, officially flags Canada as an emerging threat node in the North American drug supply chain.<br>As The Bureau reported earlier this week, the DEA highlighted the dismantling of a fentanyl “super laboratory” in October 2024 in Falkland, British Columbia - a mountainous corridor between Vancouver and Calgary - as an emerging threat in fentanyl trafficking targeting the United States. Sources pointed to the same converged threat networ - China, Iran, and Mexico - mentioned today by FBI Director Kash Patel.<br>“According to these sources,” The Bureau reported Friday, “the site forms part of a broader criminal convergence involving Chinese, Mexican, and Iranian networks operating across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. The Bureau’s sources indicate that the Falkland facility was connected to Chinese chemical exporters sanctioned by the United States Treasury, Iranian threat actors, and operatives from Mexican drug cartels.”<br>In his remarks today, Patel appeared to directly link this criminal convergence to terrorist infiltration.<br>“And I’ll give you a statistic that I gave to Congress that nobody was paying attention to,” Patel added. “Over 300 known or suspected terrorists crossed into this country last year, illegally… 85 percent of them came in through the northern border.”<br>Patel also appeared to turn up the political pressure on Ottawa, alluding to President Trump’s recent controversial statements about Canada - which became a flashpoint in the federal election, with many voters embracing the Liberal Party’s campaign framing Carney as a bulwark against Trump.<br>“I don&#39;t care about getting into this debate about making someone the 51st state or not,” Patel said, referencing Trump’s remarks. “But [Canada] are a partner in the north. And say what you want about Mexico - but they helped us seal the southern border. But facts speak for themselves. It’s the [northern] border that&#39;s open.”<br>The Bureau will continue to follow this story in the coming week.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R253" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">254</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:4391px;left:-1px">IRAN LẠI BẮT TRỚN LÀM BOM HẠCH TÂM NHƯ BẮC HÀN<br>Vì Donald Trump lại bắt chước nghệ thuật của Bill Clinton 30 năm trước: nạp tiền cho lãnh đạo Iran tiến hành việc đó căn cứ trên lời hứa đáng tin bằng Thằng Cuội.<br>Trên Gatestone Institute, học giả am hiểu là Majid Rafizadeh kể lại chuyện đó, như ‘Art of the Deal’ của bọn sát nhân sau khi chúng cho Giáo chủ Donald Dumb húp mật ong...<br>https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/.../iran-using-north...<br>Iran Is Using North Korea&#39;s Playbook - And the US Is Falling for It Again<br>(by Majid Rafizadeh - Gatestone Institute - May 17, 2025)<br>* Iran appears to be using diplomacy to stall, deceive and advance its nuclear capabilities behind closed doors, while securing financial and geopolitical concessions from the West.<br>* The disturbing part is not that Iran&#39;s mullahs are following their usual tactics.

(Photo by Haitham Al-Shukairi/AFP via Getty Images)<br>As the United States continues negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, if it does not already have them, it has become clear that the Islamic Republic&#39;s regime is not pursuing these talks in good faith.<br>Far from viewing negotiations as a means toward a peaceful resolution, the Iranian regime appears to see them as a tool that has proven successful before, not only for itself but also for its authoritarian ally, North Korea.<br>Iran appears to be using diplomacy to stall, deceive and advance its nuclear capabilities behind closed doors, while securing financial and geopolitical concessions from the West.<br>The disturbing part is not that Iran&#39;s mullahs are following their usual tactics. The horror is that American officials and Western leaders appear to be falling for this shell-game all over again.<br>To understand how dangerously naïve the apparent US approach is, one only needs to revisit the trajectory of North Korea&#39;s nuclear program. In the early 1980s, North Korea under Kim Il Sung began developing nuclear technology under the pretense - of course - of producing only peaceful civilian nuclear energy. The international community - credulous hopeful and thrilled to avoid confrontation - pursued negotiations. The result was the 1994 &quot;Agreed Framework&quot; under President Bill Clinton, in which North Korea agreed to freeze its plutonium weapons program in exchange for aid, oil shipments and help with building light-water nuclear reactors.<br>U.S. officials celebrated it as a diplomatic victory. As the West congratulated itself, North Korea quietly advanced its nuclear weapons program to the goal line. By the time Washington discovered the deception, North Korea had successfully negotiated enough time to become a nuclear-armed state.<br>In 2006, North Korea shocked the world by conducting its first successful nuclear detonation. Today, North Korea possesses dozens of nuclear warheads and a large stockpile of ballistic missiles, including ICBMs capable of hitting cities in the continental United States. This is the true legacy of negotiating with tyrannical regimes.<br>The problem with enriching hostile regimes to &quot;buy quiet&quot; is that this is the money they use to build nuclear weapons with which to attack us.<br>With Iran, the parallel is pronounced. Iran&#39;s clandestine nuclear weapons program was first publicly exposed in 2002 by the National Council of Resistance of Iran, a dissident group that revealed the existence of secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Arak. This revelation set off more than two decades of international efforts - diplomatic pressure, United Nations sanctions, and multiple rounds of talks, talks, talks - aimed at halting the regime&#39;s nuclear plans. Western governments, doggedly convinced they can negotiate their way to security, repeatedly return to the table.<br>Under President Barack Obama, the United States proudly spearheaded the disastrous 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which, according to the Obama administration, would &quot;prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,&quot; in exchange for sanctions relief. Unfortunately, the deal included a sunset clause &quot;loophole&quot;: In just a few years - which would have ended this October - Iran would have legitimately been able to have as many nuclear weapons as it could acquire, along with the missiles to deliver them.<br>The administration heralded the deal as a historic breakthrough, but the facts – including the sunset clause provision - tell a different story.<br>Meanwhile, Iran&#39;s leaders pocketed billions in sanctions relief, which they funneled into their military, their regional proxies, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. After reaping the benefits, Iran ramped up uranium enrichment to 60%, expelled international inspectors, and threatened to go beyond every previous red line. Just last week, satellite surveillance discovered yet another secret nuclear site in Iran.<br>An additional problem, unfortunately, is that the Iranian regime has a well-documented history of lying (here, here, here and here).<br>Two and a half decades have passed since the world first discovered Iran&#39;s nuclear weapons ambitions, and where are we? Iran is closer than ever to developing a nuclear bomb, if it has not done so already. According to recent reports, Iran possesses enough highly enriched uranium to build at least six nuclear weapons in a matter of weeks. Iran has developed advanced centrifuges, hardened its underground facilities, and honed its ballistic missile program. In other words, Iran&#39;s strategy has been working: feign interest in diplomacy, delay enforcement, outmaneuver weak foreign leaders, and emerge as a nuclear-armed state.<br>Despite this damning record, Western leaders continue to pretend that a new round of talks will yield different results. Even now, Iranian negotiators insist on their &quot;inalienable right&quot; to enrich uranium, and have refused any deal that would fully dismantled the country&#39;s nuclear infrastructure. This response should tell us everything we need to know. No deal that permits any level of enrichment or allows Iran to keep its centrifuges intact will prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. Washington nevertheless continues to play this dangerous game, hoping that the mullahs will prefer complete dismantlement to &quot;Plan B.&quot;<br>There has been not even been a firm timeline. President Donald Trump&#39;s original ultimatum to Iran of &quot;two months&quot; from March 7, 2025, is long gone. This statement, intended to show strength and resolution, is the second ultimatum Trump has blown through since taking office in January 2025. The first was that Hamas had to release all the Israeli hostages it holds in Gaza by a certain date, &quot;or all hell is going to break out.&quot; Well, one hostage was released - the American one - while leaving the other hostages with Hamas, but no hell broke out. That makes strike two. So much for America&#39;s credibility. As the late renowned Middle East historian Bernard Lewis is credited as having said, &quot;America is harmless as an enemy but treacherous as a friend.&quot;<br>Iran&#39;s theocratic regime openly chants &quot;Death to America&quot; and &quot;Death to Israel.&quot; It no doubt plans to continue sponsoring terrorism, crushing dissent at home, seeking regional and global hegemony and &quot;death&quot; to both of its Satans. Hoping that such a regime will actually voluntarily disarm is most likely based on assumptions that are wobbly at best.<br>What makes the current situation even more exasperating is that despite decades of talks, deals and diplomatic theater with North Korea, Russia, China and Iran, we have watched them exploit Western weakness and lack of resolve time and again right under our noses. Yet, like Charlie Brown and the football, the West insists on accepting the same failed, bogus guarantees. We do not need another Swiss-cheese agreement filled with loopholes. We do not need photo-ops and press conferences proclaiming bogus triumphs. America needs a serious, uncompromising strategy that actually eliminates Iran&#39;s nuclear capabilities - permanently and completely: no centrifuges, no missiles, no uranium enrichment.<br>We are trying to &quot;deal&quot; with theocrats who believe it is their divine duty to destroy Israel and America, and take over the oil-rich states in the Persian Gulf.<br>Iran&#39;s mullahs have played us long enough.

Today, now that I have a much better understanding of processes driving historical dynamics, I realize that the overwhelming majority of these novels took place during the disintegrative (crisis) periods. As an example, two of my favorite novels were La Reine Margot by Alexandre Dumas and A Chronicle of the Reign of Charles IX by Prosper Mérimée. Both describe intraelite conflicts during the French Wars of Religion (hereafter the FWR).<br>Henry of Navarre and Margaret of Valois Source<br>I asked ChatGPT to give me a one-sentence explanation of the causes of this bloody and lengthy civil war. Here’s what it said: “The French Wars of Religion were primarily caused by growing tensions between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots) in France, fueled by religious intolerance, political rivalries among noble families, and a weak monarchy unable to maintain order.” This answer perfectly encapsulates the standard story as seen in popular historical books, or online encyclopedias (LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are great at summarizing such common wisdom).<br>Readers of my books and blog posts would immediately realize that Cliodynamics gives a very different answer. Noble rivalries and religious tensions were what happened on the surface. But the deep structural causes of the FWR were popular immiseration, elite overproduction leading to intraelite conflict, and fiscal collapse of the state. In other words, the usual suspects when we talk about structural-demographic crises.<br>The Day of the Barricades (Paris, 1588), an ostensibly spontaneous popular uprising, which was in reality organized by counter-elites Source<br>What I’d like to do in this post series is delve a bit into these structural causes (for a deeper dive read Chapter 5 of Secular Cycles). I have two reasons to do so. First, the onset of the FWR gives us a nearly perfect example of how structural-demographic trends lead to state collapse and civil wars. Second, it was the fiscal collapse of the state that triggered warfare in c.1560. I wrote about the possibility of such a trigger for the America today in a recent post, where I concluded that we are fairly immune against it. But France in the sixteenth century was, most emphatically, not immune.<br>The ultimate driver, as usual in agrarian states, was population growth. During the integrative phase of the cycle (1450 to 1560) the population of France doubled: from 10–11 to 20–22 million. The French Kingdom in the sixteenth century was an overwhelmingly agrarian state and agricultural productivity couldn’t keep up with such massive population growth. As a result, food prices exploded. The price of a setier (a measure of volume) of wheat in livres tournois (the standard monetary unit in early-modern France) increased 10-fold between the 1460s and 1560s. Overpopulation created a high demand for food, inflating its price, and it increased the supply of labor, deflating its price. During the sixteenth century real wages lost two-thirds or more of their buying capacity. The daily wage of the Parisian laborer could buy 16 kg of grain in the 1490s, compared to less than 4 kg one century later.<br>Real wage in France, 1450–1700, in kg of grain per day. The real wage is calculated by taking an average of the wages paid to laborers and craftsmen in Paris, as reported by Allen (2001), and deflating them with the price of wheat (Abel 1980). Source: Chapter 5 of Secular Cycles.<br>While the general population immiserated, land-owning elites prospered, as the products of land, such as grain, increased in price, while the price of labor decreased. This favorable economic conjuncture for the elites resulted in two related developments. First, growing inequality among commoners meant that although the great majority of them were sinking into misery, a small minority, profiting from low wages, did very well and acquired substantial wealth. These well-to-do commoners, wealthy farmers and merchants, naturally aspired to translate their wealth into elite status. Many such elite aspirants succeeded, generating a steady inflow into the ranks of nobility.<br>Second, many noble families started to provide substantial inheritances to their younger sons. This practice led to estate subdivision and multiplication of nobles. For example, one of the richest French magnates, François de la Trémoille (1502–42) had to provide for five sons (and dowries for two daughters).<br>Driven by upward mobility and estate subdivision the numbers of nobles increased dramatically during the sixteenth century. For example, the numbers of the top elite stratum (pairs laïques—lay peers) tripled between1505 and 1588 (more detail in Part II of this series).<br>An inevitable result of this increase was intensifying intraelite competition for status and wealth. One way we can gage increasing pressures on the elites is by the incidence of intraelite violence, which during this period took the form of dueling. Dueling had almost disappeared in France during the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Under François I and Henri II a handful of judicial duels took place with royal sanction.<br>The duel between Jarnac and La Châtaignerie (1547). Henri II presides. The two combatants were members of the rival elite factions, Montmorency and Guise (more on this in the next installment) Source<br>After 1560, however, dueling for personal honor and without royal sanction became so common that it was believed that more noblemen died from it than in combat. Between 7,000 to 8,000 nobles were killed in the two last decades of the sixteenth century. It was said that Henri IV granted over 6,000 pardons for the killing of gentlemen in duels during just the first ten years of the seventeenth century.<br>Of course, duels loom large in the historical romances I read as a boy.<br>In the next installment, we will see how intraelite competition and conflicts led to the collapse of the Renaissance state in France.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R256" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">257</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/17/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2333px;left:-1px">ĐÁNG LẼ TRUMP NÊN CÂM!<br>Chỉ nói Tối Cao Pháp Viện sẽ quyết định về một vấn đề hệ trọng của nước Mỹ.

John Sauer told the court on May 15 that judges were exceeding the authority granted to them under Article III of the Constitution. On the other side, New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum defended the blocks on Trump’s policy.<br>Birthright citizenship comes from the 14th Amendment and refers to the idea that certain people receive U.S. citizenship by virtue of being born in the country. While Trump’s critics have said this guarantee extends to the children of illegal immigrants, Republicans have argued the amendment requires parents to have some kind of allegiance to the country before their children receive citizenship.<br>On the day of the hearing, Trump said on Truth Social that “Birthright Citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent Citizens of the United States of America, and bringing their families with them, all the time laughing at the “SUCKERS” that we are!”<br>The Supreme Court’s eventual decision could include more tentative observations about the policy’s constitutionality, potentially teeing up a more conventional Supreme Court hearing about the 14th Amendment and federal law.<br>In the meantime, the justices’ thoughts about the constitutionality could help them determine whether a nationwide block was appropriate.

Some of the justices’ questions indicated they were concerned about what would replace nationwide injunctions.<br>Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that class actions, or lawsuits in which multiple plaintiffs sue on behalf of a larger group of plaintiffs, could take the place of nationwide injunctions. If nationwide injunctions were not available in this case, people could file class actions, which could “solve a large part of the problem in a way that complies with the rules,” the justice said.<br>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the government’s proposal to curtail nationwide injunctions would make it more difficult for people to sue to vindicate their rights. “Your argument seems to turn our justice system … into a ‘catch me if you can’ kind of regime … where everybody has to have a lawyer and file a lawsuit in order for the government to stop violating people’s rights,” she told Sauer.<br>Sauer disagreed, saying that given the status quo, “the ‘catch me if you can’ problem operates in the opposite direction where we have the government racing from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, having to sort of clear the table in order to implement a new policy.”<br>George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley said on social media that the issue “could be a nail-biter.” He added that he thought “the Administration still has an advantage in curtailing universal injunctions” but that he “did not come away with the senes of a lock with a majority.”<br>If the justices rule against Trump, it could amplify already brewing tensions between the executive and judiciary, which is wrestling with a long list of challenges to Trump’s policies.

As you will see, he helps explain how we reached this somewhat fraught place in world history. So let’s jump in…<br>1/ A Geopolitical Tale: <br>How We Got Where We Are by George Friedman<br>This is the story of how we got to a moment in history defined by global and national crises. It is the story about how a radical geopolitical transition is taking place as old socio-economic and institutional cycles in the US end and new ones begin. But there is also a massive global geopolitical crisis taking place. The story is long and complex. I wish it were shorter, but the complexities are such that there is no way to tell it simply. It began 80 years ago and brings us to our current crises. We are in the storm before the calm, and it’s as intense as storms can be.<br>During the Cold War, the geopolitical system had an anchor: the confrontation between the United States and Soviet Union. All other nations had three options. They could align with the US, align with the Soviet Union, or be neutral. This did not define all international activity, of course, but the Cold War set the rules around which international activity took place. The Cold War was based on the assumption that a Russian invasion of Western Europe was a genuine threat to the US, and that NATO and US forces were therefore indispensable. If anything, they might have been insufficient to stop a determined Russian assault, or so the thinking went.<br>The Cold War did not end with the fall of communism; it ended with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Some say Russia intended only to seize the parts of Ukraine it now holds. But this belies the nature of the invasion. Russia invaded Ukraine on four axes: an attack from the east, a second thrust from the north down the country’s center, a third from the north meant to occupy the capital, and a fourth one from the south. It was an all-out attack whose only purpose was to occupy the whole of Ukraine. Had Russia’s intentions been more measured, Moscow might have massed its forces against Eastern Ukraine. But that isn’t what it did.<br>This is important to the new geopolitical reality because the Russian invasion, in no uncertain terms, failed. It failed so badly that Vladimir Putin sent in mercenaries from the Wagner Group to bolster Russia’s conventional military. The mercenaries feuded with, but were not completely under the command of, Russian military leaders. So bad was the animosity between them that the Wagner Group staged an insurrection against Putin. This, too, failed, leading to the group leader’s death in a plane crash some weeks later.<br>Russia’s failure to rapidly subdue Ukraine, a much smaller and seemingly weaker country, was the point at which the Cold War really ended. After three years of war, it was clear that Russia was not the threat many had believed. Ukraine may have been receiving weapons and supplies from the West, but there were no Western troops on the ground. It became clear that the foundation of the Cold War - the Russian capacity to invade and occupy Western Europe - was not possible without radical reconstruction that would take many years to achieve. And perhaps not even then. The war in Ukraine showed that Russia could not invade and occupy Europe.<br>From the 1940s to the 1990s, the US justified its defense of Europe on moral grounds. It was framed as liberal democracy against tyrannical communism. This was true but not the whole truth, which lay in the geopolitical imperatives of the US - imperatives deeply embedded in US strategic reality. That reality rested on US geography.<br>The US is the dominant power in North America by massive degrees. It is one of the few countries in the world - and the only major power - that cannot be invaded by land. To the north is Canada, to the south Mexico, and neither is a conceivable military threat. Any threat to the US mainland would have come from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, which are more reliable as buffers to attack than a source of it.<br>In 1890, Adm. Alfred Thayer Mahan wrote a book called “The Influence of Sea Power upon History,” which is the intellectual foundation of US grand strategy to this day. US national security, he argued, depends on command of the sea. So long as there is no threat in the Atlantic or Pacific, US security is assured. And by logical extension, the US does not have an interest in the Eastern Hemisphere.<br>Thus the US did not get involved in World War I until U-Boats started attacking Atlantic shipping lanes and sank the Lusitania, at the cost of many American lives. The US joined the war to block the German navy from accessing the Atlantic. Years later, Washington passed the Lend-Lease Act, an agreement with Britain aimed at making sure Germany didn’t invade, defeat, or take control of the Royal Navy and, in doing so, challenge the US. In fact, there was a proviso in the agreement that said that in the event of British capitulation to Germany, the Royal Navy would move to North America. Only after all this, when Japan devastated the American Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, did Washington conduct a strategy to drive Japan out of the Pacific.<br>The US approached the Soviet Union from an ideological position, but the fundamental geopolitical reality was that if Moscow took Western Europe, it would be able to hold Atlantic ports, construct a significant navy, and threaten the US via the Atlantic. In the third world, now called the Global South, the US and Russians competed for the most part through proxies for dominance. Neither really wanted dominance, but neither did they want the other to dominate. All of this dissolved with the outcome of the war in Ukraine. Now that it is unanchored by the Cold War, the US faces a new geopolitical reality that is redefining the global system and America’s place in it.<br>The end of the Cold War means the Russian threat to the Atlantic is gone. From the US perspective, China is a threat in the Pacific, but it is a future threat because it lacks the naval capabilities to control the seas. China cannot, for example, reliably navigate warships through waters in ready range of US drones. Even if its navy could break into the Pacific at some point, the ability of its vessels to return to base for supplies - or for supplies to reach the vessels - in amphibious operations would be a high risk.<br>The US has, then, returned to a familiar geopolitical reality: It controls the Atlantic, and there is only a limited threat in the Pacific. It has rebuilt its national security on its former foundations. The US has command of the seas, and its geopolitical imperative in Europe and the Third World has been achieved. The US national strategy must change accordingly, and the change is radical. Since the end of World War II, the US has been heavily involved in the Eastern Hemisphere. In Europe, it stood guard against Russia. In the Pacific, it built alliances with nations and islands to limit China’s access to the Pacific in the event of war.<br>Source: Geopolitical Futures [Sẽ yết bản đồ sau]<br>The US no longer needs a major forward deployment on the ground in Europe and needs only minimal exposure in the Pacific. Nor does the US feel the need to block Russian influence in the Global South. In other words, the need the US once felt to deploy major forces on a global basis is gone because the geopolitics of the Cold War are gone. The current US geopolitical imperative is to minimize the risk and cost of extensive engagement in the security of the Eastern Hemisphere. What was unthinkable for 80 years is now rational.<br>Russia’s greatest weakness was its economy. America’s greatest strength was its economy. The Russians might be able to guarantee the security of a nation, but not its economic growth or well-being. US strategy, therefore, had two dimensions: the martial and the economic. This was first made clear in the Marshall Plan, which was pivotal in resurrecting European economies. It also gave NATO members, for example, an opportunity to recreate their militaries and array them against the Russian threat. In creating this program, and then in creating an economic system that allowed them access to the powerful American market, the US used economic strategies to improve the internal security of militarily allied countries. This strategy was pursued geopolitically in the competition of the US and Russia in the Global South. Access to the Russian market was limited by both Russian policy and necessity. A relationship with Russia did not bring economic rewards. The US used foreign aid and access to American markets as an incentive to governments and the public to remain in the American sphere of influence. The method, beyond foreign aid, was in allowing the United States to maintain negative balances of trade with many countries.<br>Given the geopolitical situation, it was a cost-effective strategy, much cheaper than waging war, which in many cases was waged anyway. First, the US resurrected former enemies such as Japan to have favorable access to the American economy. “Made in Japan” was a common substitute for cheap and poorly made products. But it helped rebuild Japan as it did Europe and turned it into a military asset of bases and cooperation. Again, the US policy of ready access to US markets and initial aid was a powerful geopolitical tool Russia didn’t have. It was instrumental in winning the Cold War. Now this strategy is obsolete.<br>Two things are happening in tandem. First, the United States is abandoning or at least weakening its military obligations to other countries, and in doing so it is reducing the risk of becoming engaged in foreign wars, something that had been the norm in the past. Second, the United States is trying to equalize its balance of trade with the rest of the world. It was happy to float imbalances for decades, but it no longer believes that that’s a price worth paying.<br>Consider the case of China. China and Russia had hostile relations when they were both communist countries. At about the same time, Henry Kissinger went to China on his famous mission to establish relations, Russia was attacking China along their shared border on the Ussuri River. This and countless previous conflicts like it show the limits of ideology in geopolitics.<br>After Mao’s death and China’s adoption of controlled capitalism, China began to take Japan’s place as a low-cost, low-quality exporter. The decision to open up its economy was one of the key factors in China’s breakneck economic growth in the late 20th century. Many in the US saw US engagement with China as tantamount to strengthening an enemy. But two considerations took precedence: The US had become addicted to low-cost exports, and engaging China would further drive a wedge between China and Russia.<br>Central to the China policy was massive investment. China had economic relations with many countries, of course, but the US had (and still has) the largest economy in the world, so access to its markets would be vital for a growing economy such as China’s. Its economy would continue to boom until the late 2010s, when several structural issues and the COVID-19 pandemic slowed growth considerably. Geopolitical shifts are rapid in the face of outright war or economic catastrophe. They are slower when neither is present.<br>The United States now has three imperatives: end the social crisis of the culture wars; repair the economic realities that have become obsolete; and transform an obsolete institutional system. The socio-economic cycle transitions about every 50 years, the institutional cycles every 80 years. But there is no cycle in geopolitics. It happens when it happens, and it is happening now. This is therefore an intense period as major systems become obsolescent and thus create a crisis, followed by a political storm that disrupts the obsolete systems, followed by a new, engineered reality, and then ending with a calm after the storm. What has happened is all these cycles are hitting at once, and their convergence has led to a period of unusual intensity.<br>The US has a geopolitical imperative to disengage from the risks and burdens imposed by its involvement in wars globally. Reducing geopolitical risk involves reducing economic exposure to the world and military responsibility. One of the foundations of economic relations was a substantial imbalance in trade, the justification for which is now obsolete.<br>American security posture shifted over the course of the Ukraine war, when the failure of Russia to defeat Ukraine completely ended the Cold War’s foundational logic. In turn, this led to a shift in security policy as well as a massive shift in economic policy and the United States’ attitude towards free trade. Meanwhile, the end of the Cold War has created a crisis in Europe, which likewise has to redefine itself after 80 years of the status quo. The need is now for the United States to disengage to some significant extent from its global economic policy.<br>The US’s dramatic introduction of massive tariffs is thus geopolitically driven. Its method is an engineering decision intended to break the old system and open the door for a new one. It created a geopolitical crisis by its engineering.<br>Here again, China is a useful example. The US has troubled relations with China. The geopolitical problem is mitigated by the economic problem, but with the Cold War over, the cost is no longer essential. The economic problem with China has been integrated with the geopolitical. Relatively free trade with China achieved a geopolitical purpose but weakened the American economy in two ways: Lower labor costs allowed for cheap exports and for the relocation of businesses to China. But the problems went deeper than that. The US became dependent on imports of key components, sometimes entire alternatives, to US production. If those were cut off, it would create a massive crisis that would require Washington to revive domestic production of finished products and essential components alike.<br>US-Chinese relations may have been poor, but they were never so bad as to threaten war. China could choose to place the US into a very dangerous position, not unlike the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s. A war was fought by Egypt and Syria against Israel in 1973. The attackers were supplied by Russia, the Israelis by the US. Israel’s victory produced anti-US anger in the Arab world. Arab oil producers, who provided the US with a substantial portion of its oil, then imposed an embargo. This came at a great cost to the Arabs, but the geopolitics of the Arab world forced their hand. The loss of an essential energy import pushed the United States into a massive economic crisis. It was a case in which geopolitical necessity overrode economic considerations.<br>China exports essential industrial components to the United States. It is also a geopolitical competitor with the United States. If events force China to accept economic and financial costs for geopolitical advantage, it could talk itself into imposing an embargo. This results in a massive geopolitical vulnerability for the US. In addition to wanting to change economic relationships on a global level, the US urgently needed to do so first with China.<br>US efforts to distance itself from the rest of the world have predictably caused internal and external turmoil. Done more slowly, it would have caused merely long-term unease. Unease and turmoil are both parts of obsolete geopolitical models. The evolution of those models is both disruptive and poorly understood because of the perception that the forces of geopolitical necessity seem less deterministic than the forces behind economics.<br>But the truth - and this is the point of this story - is that the forces of humanity as a whole generate impersonal pressures that overwhelm human preferences as they define reality. The transition to new realities was less bloody than the end of the European age in 1945 and the emergence of the American age. But on the other hand, it did not change the fundamental geopolitical reality. Where Europe was replaced as the center of the world, the US remains the center, so the turmoil is not the beginning of the storm, but the last storm before the new calm.<br>***<br>John here again. I hope you enjoyed George’s perspective on the global economy and the geopolitical issues we face. I am lucky because I get to talk with George and from time to time, Shane and I can be with George and Meredith in the evenings and sometimes spend days enjoying both light and heavy conversations.<br>But between those times, I really look forward to my frequent missives from Geopolitical Futures with quick, thoughtful analysis of the week’s important topics.

I will give you more details when they are actually open.<br>It has been a busy week with the SIC. My daughter Tiffani is also here. She worked with me for almost 15 years before taking a sabbatical, and as the idea for opening a new type of longevity clinic with Dr. Mike Roizen began to emerge, I asked her to shift her career and come back to explore the economics and reality of what it would take. In one sense, the business and science are straightforward. In another real sense, the medical world is every bit as regulated as the investment world, and I am having to learn whole new terminologies in legal documents, along with the usual complexities of starting any new business. We have a growing team and I’m learning a lot. It is good to be challenged and to work with people you like. Lots of new tricks for this old dog.<br>And with that, I will hit the send button. You have a great week. I will spend much of this weekend reviewing the SIC transcripts and thinking about how that impacts pretty much everything I do. On Friday I will interview Howard Marks and Joe Lonsdale. Both are friends but it is still intimidating to do it in front of thousands of people. I am glad that Ed D’Agostino is shouldering a lot of the moderation at this SIC. He excels at it in a way that I never would.

Quý vị đọc câu tóm lược trên thì giật mình đọc lại mà vẫn không thể hiểu nổi. Chỉ vì chúng ta cần một pho sách về sự sa đọa lan rộng giữa nhiều người, và kéo dài trong nhiều năm, của siêu cường dân chủ nhất thế giới. Đâm ra chữ dân chủ là một mỉa mai. <br>Đó là thực tế lưu cữu của đảng Dân Chủ song hành với truyền thông cánh tả! Không có hơn trăm chữ dẫn nhập, quý vị sẽ khó thấy ra nỗ lực của giáo sư Jonathan Turley khi trình bày một sự kinh hoàng có thật tại Hoa Kỳ vừa mới được tòa án cho công khai hóa….<br>Một tổng thống đương nhiệm đã tàng trữ ngổn ngang từng thùng tài liệu mật ở nơi này nơi khác suốt mấy năm trong tư thất tại một tiểu bang khác nên mới bị điều tra. Trong hai ngày phỏng vấn vào Tháng 10, 2023 của luật sư có thẩm quyền, Tổng thống Mỹ là Joe Biden quanh co nói trước quên sau như người mất trí - vì thật sự mất trí. Viên luật sư thực hiện việc điều ra bèn kết luận: nếu ra trước tòa, bồi thẩm đoàn cũng khó kết tội một người có vẻ dễ thương đầy thiện chí, mà già nua và mất trí nhớ. Nôm na là không nên kết tội.<br>Tất nhiên, nhiều người không đồng ý với kết luận đó. <br>Nhưng truyền thông và giới chính trị của Phủ Tổng thống không đồng ý rằng lãnh đạo Hoa Kỳ lại là một ông già mất trí. Họ là tập thể ồn ào ráo riết bao che sự thật khi hệ thống chính trị đương quyền lại tấp nập truy tố cựu Tổng thống Donald Trump cũng về tội tàng trữ tài liệu ở tại nhà trong mục tiêu tống tiền chính trị!<br>Cho tới Tháng Bảy 2024, trong cuộc tranh luận duy nhất của cuộc bầu cử tổng thống giữa hai ứng cử viên Trump và Biden thì cả thế giới chứng kiến tình trạng tâm thần của Tổng thống Biden. Mà từ Tháng 10 2023 đến sau này, Bộ Tư Pháp của Chính quyền Biden không cho phép công bố nội dung cuộc phỏng vấn của luật sư Robert Hur như đã được yêu cầu.<br>Bây giờ, cuộc phỏng vấn vừa trở thành công khai đã công khai hóa một chuỗi tội ác là toa rập với nhau để che giấu sự thật về Joe Biden. Những ai toa rập? Đông lắm. Vì mục đích gì? Nhiều lắm…<br>Xin quý vị thưởng thức nghệ thuật trình bày một kỳ án chính trị của nền dân chủ đang mưng mủ tèm lem - từ trên đầu! <br>Và sẽ thành đầu sách để hái ra tiền. <br>https://jonathanturley.org/.../for-posteritys-sake-why.../<br>“For Posterity’s Sake”: Why the Biden-Hur Tapes is a Virtual Racketeering Indictment<br>Erin Scott/White House via Flickr/Public Domain<br>(Jonathan Turley - Columns, Justice, Media, Politics - May 17, 2025) <br>“For posterity’s sake.” Those words from President Joe Biden sum up the crushing impact of the leaked audiotapes from the interview between then-President Joe Biden and Special Counsel Robert Hur. <br>Not only did they remove any serious doubt over Biden committing the federal crimes charged against President Donald Trump, but they also constituted what is akin to a political racketeering indictment against much of the Washington establishment.<br>The interview from Oct. 8-9, 2023, has long been sought by Congress, but was kept under wraps by the government even as Biden campaigned for a second term.<br>Many of us balked at Hur’s conclusion that no charges were appropriate despite the fact that the President removed classified material for decades, stored it in grossly negligent ways, and moved it around to unsecure locations, including his garage in Delaware.<br>Given President Donald Trump’s indictment for the same offenses, it was hard to imagine how the Special Counsel could not recommend the same criminal charges (presumably after he left office).<br>Instead, Hur declared it would have been hard to get a jury to convict Biden because he was “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”<br>It appears that Trump, on the other hand, was presumptively not sympathetic or well-meaning and possessed a good memory for prosecution.<br>The contrast was glaring and only reinforced the view of many citizens that there are two tracks for justice in Washington.<br>Soon after the report’s release, President Biden gave an irate press conference in which he lied about the findings of his culpability and lashed out at any suggestion that he had gapped or stumbled in the interview.<br>For example, when reporters raised how Biden forgot when his son Beau died, Biden angrily responded, “How in the hell dare he raise that?” Frankly, when I was asked the question I thought to myself it wasn’t any of their damn business.”<br>However, it was not Hur but Biden himself who raised the death of his son, and he forgot a wide array of dates, including when he served in office.<br>The interview shows that in 2023 it was clear that Biden was mentally diminished despite claims from many allies and former aides that there was a sudden loss of capacity just before the disastrous debate in 2024.  It is now undeniable that the White House staff actively hid the president’s incompetence from the American public. That includes the White House press secretary Jen Psaki (who left her post in May 2022) and Karine Jean-Pierre who insisted that Biden was sharp and “running circles” around the staff.<br>Of course, the media is now covering the story after the public saw the truth in the debate. Figures like CNN’s Jake Tapper have even written books that belatedly pursue the question despite previously insisting that there was no evidence of a diminishment in Biden’s mental state.<br>Tapper repeatedly dismissed the claim and even mocked Lara Trump for raising it. In one interview, he pushed a White House talking point that such suggestions were mocking Biden for a childhood stutter:<br>“It’s so amazing to me- a ‘cognitive decline.’ I think you were mocking his stutter. Yeah. I think you were mocking his stutter and I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody’s cognitive decline. I would think somebody in the Trump family would be more sensitive to people who do not have medical licenses diagnosing politicians from afar.”<br>When Lara Trump insisted that this was clearly evidence of a “very concerning” cognitive decline, Tapper dismissed her statement by saying  “Thank you, Lara. I’m sure it’s from a place of concern. We all believe that.”<br>Keep in mind that others beyond Lara Trump were raising this issue and there were tapes showing physical and mental diminishment. The media simply refused to seriously pursue the story until the cover-up no longer mattered after the debate.<br>Over on MSNBC, Joe Scarborough was equally apoplectic at those raising the issue and stated<br>    “start your tape right now because I’m about to tell you the truth. And F— you if you can’t handle the truth. This version of Biden intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever. Not a close second. And I have known him for years…If it weren’t the truth I wouldn’t say it<br>This media effort continued all the way up to the debate itself. On CNN, Oliver Darcy wrote, “Right-wing media figures are desperately pushing conspiracy theories about Biden ahead of the debate.”<br>Once the public found out, the media was ready to tell the story when there was no longer any advance or ability to deny it. Articles began to appear with the same realization of “Oh you meant THAT mental decline. Well sure.”<br>It was the same belated acknowledgment that came, after the election, with Hunter Biden’s laptop. The media just moved on with a shrug and a collective “our bad” concession.<br>As for the President himself, the one moment of clarity in the interview may have been his most incriminating line. When asked why he removed classified material on Afghanistan, Biden admitted “I guess I wanted to hang on to it for posterity’s sake.”<br>That is precisely what critics on CNN and MSNBC accused Trump of doing: removing material as types of keepsakes or trophies.<br>One president was indicted for that and one was sent along his way to a second term in office.<br>The real indictment that comes out of these tapes is a type of political racketeering enterprise by the Washington establishment. It took a total team effort from Democratic politicians to the White House staff to the media to hide the fact that the President of the United States was mentally diminished. If there were a political RICO crime, half of Washington would be frog-marched to the nearest federal courthouse.<br>Of course, none of this complicity in the cover-up is an actual crime. It is part of the Washington racket.<br>After all, this is Washington, where such duplicity results not in plea deals but book deals.<br>___<br>(Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and the author of “The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage.”)<br>This column ran in Fox com</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R259" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">260</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/16/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2333px;left:-1px">LẠC ĐỀ VÀ LẠC QUẺ!<br>Như tiếng vọng từ đáy vực của kẻ làm mối vô duyên, Trump kêu gọi Putin nên tham dự việc đàm phán với Ukraine tại xứ Turkey, khi Tổng thống Ukraine và các nước Âu Châu đều sẵn sàng.

[I] will use leverage on Putin if I have to,&quot; he said.<br>The peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on May 16 ended quickly and with no signs of progress other than a prisoner exchange deal as Ukrainian officials accused Russia of making &quot;unacceptable&quot; demands.<br>The meeting was over about 90 minutes after it began.<br>Negotiators agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners on each side in the near future, the heads of both delegations said. That would be the largest single swap since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.<br>But there was no public indication that the wide gaps between Russia and Ukraine on issues such as territory and a cease-fire were narrowed. European leaders joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in condemning Moscow.<br>&quot;The Russian position is clearly unacceptable, and not for the first time,&quot; British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a joint statement with the leaders of Poland, Germany, and France at a summit in Tirana, Albania.<br>He said that after a meeting with Zelenskyy, who was also at the summit, and a joint phone call with Trump in which they discussed the Istanbul talks, &quot;we are now closely aligning and coordinating our responses and will continue to do so.&quot;<br>&quot;Ukraine is ready to take the fastest possible steps to bring real peace, and it is important that the world holds a strong stance,&quot; Zelenskyy said on social media after the call with Trump.<br>&quot;Our position [is that] if the Russians reject a full and unconditional cease-fire and an end to killings, tough sanctions must follow,&quot; he said. &quot;Pressure on Russia must be maintained until Russia is ready to end the war.&quot;<br>Reuters cited an unnamed Ukrainian source as saying the Russian delegation made demands that were &quot;nonstarters&quot; and were &quot;detached from reality and go far beyond anything that was previously discussed.&quot;<br>The Russian delegation, led by presidential adviser Vladimir Medinsky (center), sits across from Ukrainian officials (not pictured) in Istanbul on May 16.<br>The Russian delegation, led by presidential adviser Vladimir Medinsky (center), sits across from Ukrainian officials (not pictured) in Istanbul on May 16.<br>AFP quoted a Ukrainian source as saying one such demand was &quot;for Ukraine to withdraw forces from large parts of Ukrainian territory it controls in order for a cease-fire to begin.&quot;<br>That was a reference to four regions that Russia partially occupies and baselessly claims are Russian - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson. Ukraine holds parts of those regions, including the capitals of Zaporizhzhya and Kherson.<br>Russian remarks about the meeting contrasted sharply with the criticism.<br>The leader of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin, said Moscow was &quot;satisfied with the result&quot; on the whole and is &quot;ready to continue contacts.&quot; He said his delegation had &quot;taken note&quot; of what he said was a Ukrainian request for talks between Zelenskyy and Putin.<br>Medinsky also said the negotiators agreed that &quot;each side will present its vision of a possible future cease-fire and spell it out in detail. After such a vision has been presented, we believe it would be appropriate, as also agreed, to continue our negotiations.&quot;<br>Expectations for a breakthrough had been low at the first direct peace talks since unsuccessful negotiations held in the first two months of Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion.<br>The May 16 talks capped a frenzied week of diplomacy fueled by Trump&#39;s push to broker an end to the war, which has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides and a growing number of Ukrainian civilians.<br>The Russian and Ukrainian negotiators began their meeting sometime after 1 p.m. local time (noon CET) along with officials from host nation Turkey, and it ended before 3 p.m. (14:00CET) Several separate meetings involving US, Ukrainian, Russian, European, and Turkish officials were also held.<br>Moscow has rejected calls by Ukraine, European nations, and the United States for a full and extendable 30-day cease-fire, saying a truce can only come as the result of negotiations, and Putin spurned Zelenskyy&#39;s invitation to hold their first face-to-face meeting since 2019.<br>The last time Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (left) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) met was in Paris in 2019.<br>Trump Says Meeting With Putin Key To Resolution<br>&quot;This week we had a real chance to take important steps toward ending this war. If only Putin had not been afraid to come to Turkey,&quot; Zelenskyy said in Tirana.<br>Opening the talks in Istanbul, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said it is of &quot;critical importance&quot; to implement a cease-fire &quot;as soon as possible&quot; and &quot;also very important that these talks form the basis of a leaders&#39; meeting. We wholeheartedly believe it is possible to reach peace through constructive negotiations.&quot;<br>Ahead of the talks, the leader of the Ukrainian delegation, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, said on Facebook that peace is possible only if &quot;Russia shows its readiness to take specific actions, including a complete cease-fire for at least 30 days and the implementation of humanitarian measures, such as the return of forcibly deported Ukrainian children,&quot; and the exchange of all prisoners of war.<br>Putin&#39;s decision to send a lower-level delegation to the talks, which he proposed earlier this week and which Trump urged Ukraine to agree to, had dampened already anemic expectations of substantial progress.<br>Trump, who was in the region on a Middle East trip, had hinted he might travel to Turkey to take part if Putin attended. &quot;Nothing&#39;s going to happen until Putin and I get together,&quot; Trump said after the Kremlin announced it was sending a lower-level delegation.<br>After boarding Air Force One in Abu Dhabi on May 16 for the trip back to Washington, Trump said he may call Putin soon. &quot;He and I will meet, and I think we&#39;ll solve it or maybe not,&quot; he said.<br>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, and Ukrainian Head of Presidential Office Andriy Yermak arrive for a meeting at Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul on May 16.<br>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, and Ukrainian Head of Presidential Office Andriy Yermak arrive for a meeting at Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul on May 16.<br>&quot;We&#39;re going to get it done. We got to get it done,&quot; Trump said of ending the war. &quot;Five thousand young people are being killed every single week on average, and we’re going to get it done.&quot;<br>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News on May 15 that there would be no breakthrough unless Trump and Putin sat &quot;across the table&quot; from each other.<br>&quot;I don&#39;t know what the date or the place of that is yet, but that&#39;s really the only chance at this point,&quot; said Rubio, who met with Ukrainian and Turkish officials at Istanbul&#39;s Dolmabahce Palace ahead of the Ukraine-Russia talks at the same venue.<br>Rubio reiterated &quot;the US position that the killing needs to stop,&quot; State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said. Michael Anton, head of policy planning at the State Department, was to meet separately with the Russian delegation.<br>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a Trump-Putin meeting to discuss bilateral ties, Ukraine, and other matters is &quot;certainly necessary&quot; but would take time to prepare and should not be held unless it produces results.<br>Putin launched the full-scale invasion eight years after Russia seized Ukraine&#39;s Crimean Peninsula and fomented war in the eastern Donbas region in 2014. Russia now holds about one-fifth of Ukraine&#39;s territory but has fallen far short of Putin&#39;s goal of subjugating the country, independent since the Soviet collapse in 1991.<br>The only previous direct peace talks broke up in the spring of 2022 as the sides wrangled over major points of contention and amid revelations of atrocities committed by Russian forces in Bucha, a city they abandoned as they withdrew from northern Ukraine after failing to capture Kyiv.<br>Clifford May, founder and president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, says turning away from the world could run counter to Trump&#39;s own goal of preserving US global primacy.<br>In those negotiations, Russia was seeking a deal that analysts said would have amounted to Kyiv&#39;s surrender, leaving Ukraine a permanently neutral country with a small and toothless military, limited sovereignty, and little or no access to Western security support.<br>Russian officials have suggested Moscow has not scaled back its goals despite its failure to seize Kyiv and its slow progress on the battlefield, where small territorial gains have come at a high price in Russian casualties.<br>Some experts say that a cease-fire at the current line of hostilities would be a blow to Putin&#39;s reputation at home but that the Kremlin could be forced to accept it nonetheless if the West ratchets up economic pressure on Russia, including significantly widening sanctions on its oil shipping fleet.<br>Zelenskyy: Russia &#39;Not Serious&#39;<br>The Kremlin has referred to the May 16 talks as the &quot;resumption&quot; of the 2022 negotiations. Medinsky also led the Russian team at those talks. Zelenskyy described the Russian delegation as &quot;decorative&quot; and said its makeup showed &quot;they are not serious enough about the negotiations.&quot;<br>&quot;The Russians want to draw associations with the year 2022,&quot; Zelenskyy&#39;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on May 16. &quot;But the only thing that connects to those negotiations is the city of Istanbul.

Moody’s lowered the US credit score to Aa1 from Aaa, joining Fitch Ratings and S&amp;P Global Ratings in grading the world’s biggest economy below the top, triple-A position.<br>The one-notch cut comes more than a year after Moody’s changed its outlook on the US rating to negative. The federal budget deficit is running near $2 trillion a year, or more than 6% of gross domestic product, and Congressional Republicans are pushing through budget legislation that could add trillions of dollars more. “While we recognize the US’ significant economic and financial strengths, we believe these no longer fully counterbalance the decline in fiscal metrics,” Moody’s wrote in a statement.<br>U.S. Consumer Sentiment Falls to Near Record Low<br>Short- and long-term inflation expectations hit multi-decade high<br>Source: University of Michigan<br>Earlier today, new data showed US consumer sentiment has fallen to the second-lowest level on record, and inflation expectations climbed to multi-decade highs. The preliminary May sentiment index declined to 50.8 from 52.2 a month earlier, according to the University of Michigan. That was lower than all but one estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The main reason cited was President Donald Trump’s trade war.<br>Nearly three-fourths of respondents to the Michigan survey spontaneously mentioned tariffs. The topic crosses partisan lines, including a notable share of Republicans bringing it up. The new, sobering survey data comes as inflation data from the Trump administration’s Department of Labor has been unexpectedly upbeat, coming in softer than estimates three months in a row.<br>A key House committee on Friday failed to advance House Republicans’ massive tax-and-spending bill after hard-right Republicans demanded even deeper cuts to healthcare for the poor and disabled. Proposed cuts in Medicaid would be used in part to renew 2017 GOP tax cuts that largely benefitted the wealthy and corporations and fulfill populist campaign promises by Trump to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime.<br>It’s incredibly rare for bills to fail at this step in the process, with the committee vote typically serving as a rubber-stamp to the bill before it moves to the House floor. But the Republicans are caught in a bind. With razor-thin majorities in either chamber, they can’t pull too much further to the right lest members in high-tax blue states bolt. With midterms next year, they are looking to raise the cap their own party imposed on state and local tax deductions during Trump’s first term.<br>China shrank its holdings of US Treasuries in March, with the UK replacing it as the No. 2 overseas owner. China was the top holder of Treasuries as recently as 2019, when Japan overtook it. Total overseas holdings of the debt rose $233.1 billion, to $9.05 trillion, Treasury Department figures showed Friday. While the release showed there was no revolt against American government securities in the first few months of the Trump administration, the data predates the destabilization of the US Treasuries market last month following Trump’s rollout of “reciprocal” tariffs.<br>Foreign Holdings of US Treasuries<br>China was surpassed by Japan as the top foreign owner in 2019, and has now slipped behind the UK<br>Source: Treasury Department<br>Stocks rose Friday as the Financial Times reported the US and the European Union broke an impasse to enable tariff talks, bolstering optimism about negotiations with America’s top trade partners. The news comes after the Trump administration announced an agreement with the UK and a temporary truce with China in the trade war. The renewed optimism sent the S&amp;P 500 up 0.7% Friday, with the gauge climbing over 5% for the week. Action in the bond market was muted, though Treasuries saw a third straight weekly drop - the longest slide this year.

The infamous April 2 “Liberation Day” announcements necessitated obvious treatment, and I feel the Dividend Cafe did well in the tumult of that period.  I am not sure I thought I would ever write a Dividend Cafe about the psychological motivations of an elected President when I began writing a weekly market commentary in September of 2008, but I suppose I would rather write about that than what I was writing about in September of 2008 (oh how quickly we forget what real drama feels like).  The tariff issue (with the tax bill issue behind it) has been the dominant story in markets since March, and with the “left tail risk” issue so clearly muted in light of the reclaiming of the “Trump market put,” not to mention the reversal on Chinese tariffs, I get at least one week off from those “ripped from the headline” topics.  There is still plenty to assess about the U.S. economy in the weeks and months ahead, and the Dividend Cafe will strive to be the most reliable place you can find for that assessment (I am sad to say, that is a low bar).<br>But today we won’t say the word “tariff” again, there will be no talk about the President or various policies (though on Monday there will be a lot of that!), and we won’t bounce around to a variety of market stories.  I am doing my favorite thing in writing the Dividend Cafe today – picking one topic, and writing to my heart’s content about it.<br>Today’s topic was inspired by the recent announcement of the 94-year-old, Warren Buffett, that he will retire as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year.  Worth over $150 billion, Warren Buffett is generally considered to be one of the greatest investors of all time.  And like all things that contain such superlative assessment, there is a wide dispersion of opinions behind it.  I have some opinions of my own, and those opinions will be the topic of today’s Dividend Cafe.  My purpose is actually to be very practical.  I don’t think there is a lot of benefit to me saying “he evaluated this well” or “his process of value investing around discounts to intrinsic value was very good” …  If his compound annual growth rate and also that, you know, $156 BILLION NET WORTH FIGURE didn’t validate those things, I am not sure what will.<br>Today, we are looking at a practical breakdown of what made Buffett, Buffett.  There are a couple of thoughts here that may surprise you, but I believe are vital to understanding his legacy.  And understanding his legacy can only make us all better investors.  Did I mention the $156 billion figure?<br>Let’s jump on in to the Dividend Cafe.<br>With regards,<br>David L. Bahnsen<br>Chief Investment Officer, Managing Partner<br>NGUYÊN VĂN LÁ THƯ HÔM NAY CỦA DAVID BAHNSEN:<br>Hello and welcome to the Dividend Cafe. <br>My name&#39;s David Bahnsen. I&#39;m the managing partner at the Bahnsen Group, and I have the distinct privilege of doing the Dividend Cafe every single Friday to come to you and talk about some particular investment or market principle, commentary, opinion lesson, et cetera, and I&#39;m very excited for today because I do believe it is the first time in about eight weeks where I got to sit down this morning and write about what I wanted to write about, and not by just market necessity and conditions of what&#39;s happening in the broader economy and the world around us. I didn&#39;t have to talk this week about the trade war, the market turbulence that has resulted from the tariff drama that has been going on now since, mid to late March and that really hit its apex in early April.  And as you go back over the last seven, eight weeks, in a Friday Dividend Cafe, there&#39;s been a lot of discussion about what President Trump is doing and not doing, and where the trade war is and has moved and on again, off again. <br>This week&#39;s Dividend Cafe is going to just simply be a particular topic that I wanna write about that isn&#39;t gonna touch President Trump. Tariffs trade, even the pending tax bill. I believe a lot of those things are coming back in our fray on Monday. <br>Every Monday I&#39;m trying to cover what&#39;s going on in the economy, the Fed public policy markets, housing, energy, all of these different topics, and there are things going on right now as I&#39;m talking that will probably be more resolved over the weekend. So perfect fodder for the Monday Dividend Cafe about the big, beautiful tax bill, but it&#39;s a moving target itself right now. So I&#39;m really glad to not be writing about that today and risk having the Dividend Cafe be obsolete by the time it got to you. [Quái!] So I&#39;m wanna talk today about Warren Buffett. <br>And this is not something I&#39;ve really, I don&#39;t think ever talked about in the Dividend Cafe. I&#39;ve been a student of Buffett&#39;s both his history his investment methodology and philosophy. Even before Buffett, I had read a lot of Ben Graham as a younger man, and Benjamin Graham himself was Warren Buffett&#39;s boss at his second job as a young adult and his mentor in value investing. <br>And so there, there is an element to this that&#39;s been very interesting and important to me professionally for a very long time. But that&#39;s not exactly the theme I want to get into today. To go write a Dividend Cafe about intrinsic value investing, which is what Graham and then Buffet made famous, I think it would be a little redundant and unhelpful. For one thing, we&#39;re dividend growth investors at our firm for another. There the idea of what they do essentially as a methodology that Graham codified, nearly a hundred years ago of discounting cash flows the future, and finding companies trading at a discount to what that intrinsic discounted value is. I think that there&#39;s no question that Buffet was just extraordinarily good at it, but the methodology itself may not be very interesting to you. <br>And I believe I found a topic that I think is very important out of the life and legacy and success of Warren Buffet. So I want, the reason now it&#39;s been catalyzed into the Dividend Cafe is he announced his pending retirement at the recent annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting in Omaha. Our own senior equity analyst Liping goes to that conference every year and was there to hear the announcement. <br>But let&#39;s be real, he&#39;s 94 years old. The markets have known for a very long time that Mr. Buffet would at some point, for whatever reason, not be the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway forever. But nevertheless, it&#39;s a newsworthy event. This is a remarkable person&#39;s story, history and investor success. And so I think it&#39;s an interesting topic for us here in the Dividend Cafe as to what may be. A couple of these takeaways are, but see, some of them are so are redundant, or at least I should say, not very profound. In other words, it&#39;s information you could get elsewhere. I&#39;m gonna go through a few of those and conclude with my kind of bottom line today, which I believe is a unique perspective on Buffet. That is then really not that much about Buffett and something that I think might be helpful for all of us. <br>For everyone who&#39;s an investor, for everyone who&#39;s a business leader, for everyone who is an entrepreneur, for everyone who works in an organization, there&#39;s some kind of evergreen takeaway here in Buffet that I think is worth noting, and that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do today in the Dividend Cafe, the easier ones. <br>First, you know that Warren Buffett was only worth $370 million when he was 52 years old. And he&#39;s now 94. Okay, so he&#39;s now worth $150 billion. And people could say, I&#39;m not sure that it really matters because how am I gonna accumulate $370 million by age 52? That&#39;s certainly true. It&#39;s difficult to do. But let me really make the point that is applicable with a thousand dollars, let alone the 370. I guarantee you that when you hear 370 million went to 150 billion, you&#39;re thinking of a number bigger than 15%. In fact, you might even be thinking of a number of 39000%, I think it&#39;s 38,900 to be precise because that is the return that the percentage from 370 million, 150 billion, 38900%, but no, it&#39;s 15% per year. It&#39;s just simply a story of math. The math that comes from time. That comes from what we call compounding that people talk about all the time, that most people have a very hard time recognizing. [Ta gọi là… lãi kép!] It&#39;s why. <br>There are people that will tell me, I paid X for my house. I&#39;ve lived there 30 years, and can you believe it? It&#39;s now worth y and it&#39;s a small number at X and a big number at Y. And I go, that&#39;s amazing. And I go, by the way, did you know that&#39;s 4.5% per year or 6.9% per year? Because the percentage return, what we call a CAGR, a compound annual growth rate ends up being a lot lower over greater time, which is another way of saying that time helps create a higher total return. And in Buffet&#39;s case, but from age 50 to 90, essentially to round down a little bit 15% is a big number to compound that. But when you go from a few hundred million to $150 billion and you&#39;ve as a percentage gone up that much, there&#39;s just a simple lesson in the gift of longevity. <br>One of the greatest things Warren Buffet did that was worth tens of billions of dollars to him with stay alive in his eighties and nineties. Okay now. How do you get 370 million by age 50 for him? He started off as a very young man working at his dad&#39;s stock brokerage firm, and he did very well. Principle one of compounding in time does also beg the question of principle two, which is fundamentals. <br>The man earned well and the man saved well, and he invested well, and then that allowed the compounding. And he had a million bucks by age 30. Now that&#39;s a lot of money. In 1955 or whatever the age was, by 1965, he was able to go become the lead shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway and used that as a perch from which he would obviously go into hypergrowth of his own business empire. But my point is he was blocking and tackling and he was a smart and very hardworking guy to do so with. But there isn&#39;t anything super sensationalistic. There&#39;s no dot com overnight, Bitcoin overnight, just YouTube influencer nonsensical absurdity story here. This is the blocking and tackling of fundamental wealth accumulation that then puts you in a position to accumulate. <br>But he did so with a great deal of talent. I don&#39;t wanna act like this was simple, but it was very fundamental. It was work hard, earn, save, invest, and then eventually seeing that number. There&#39;s a chart@dividendcafe.com that shows that growth over time. But I think most people are aware if they think through it, of the benefit of compounding, the benefit of being 94, and then the compounding of by working and saving early on and all those things.<br>At some point in Buffett&#39;s life, this has been talked about a lot. So again, this is also not anything new or profound. He also benefited from a benefit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. There was a self-reinforcing mechanism that Buffett got a premium in his return by being the person who owned the asset, that there was a size, a scale, but also a credibility and authority that by him owning it, it was worth more. And so he owned it &#39;cause it thought it had value and then it had value because he owned it. And then there was a value creation process within it. <br>But I don&#39;t wanna ignore the just self-fulfilling nature, I think all of us are capable of time value and compounding by avoiding the interruption of compounding. I think all of us are capable of fundamentals. Not all of us are capable of the self-fulfilling reality of things get more valuable just because you own them. So let&#39;s put that on the table there. And then the fourth thing before I get to my real, grand finale here is a hobby horse of mine. And yet I think a good opportunity. <br>To make the point that Warren Buffet was a voracious reader, and you go, come on you&#39;re saying he read a lot of books and became worth $150 billion. I know. A librarian in my town who isn&#39;t worth 30 grand and that person reads all the time. No, I&#39;m saying that reading is a necessary but not sufficient condition of elite. Knowledge accumulation applied to elite compounding of capital. In other words, the general Mattis had a quote about someone who has not read, hundreds of books as functionally illiterate. And I agree with General Mattis, that there is a lost art of accumulation and knowledge that comes from working the muscle, which is called the brain. [Wow!] <br>That processes information. Yes, it does take in information. It takes in data and starts a process of analysis. But then what it does is it exercises the muscle to make you better at analysis, better at processing, better at gathering, better at application and reading history, reading biography, reading philosophy, reading, economics, reading. Buffett&#39;s case, a massive amount of business history, but also corporate reports. The, your typical 10 Qs, 10 Ks, a lot of the analysis that stock research people like us do. But he just read voraciously and I am coming across people on a daily basis that I think are dramatically limited by the fact that they&#39;re not readers. <br>Part of it is the modern technology that people are. Their brain is outta shape for reading because they&#39;re so accustomed to video snippets, reels, scrolling, even social media, which is bite sized. But that, but look, I don&#39;t want to be in my day. We read books throughout all the human history. People read books and then got smarter. And I think that there&#39;s a lot of benefit in the great books, and I think it&#39;s a sad case of higher education. The great books of Western civilization are not promoted the way they are for one&#39;s intellectual journey. And I don&#39;t mean this just simply in the way I would talk to high school students about important. It is they be great readers. I mean it in the case of Warren Buffet, that it helped make him worth $150 billion and that there are a lot of corporate CEOs that are not readers and it limits them. Now they can be gifted in other things and they could overcome it, but it&#39;s a handicap to not be a reader. That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying. <br>And Warren Buffet, I think was a voracious reader. All right, so the time value compounding, the discipline and fundamentals, the self-fulfilment prophecy of buffet being buffet, and then yes, just, the benefit of reading, but it still leads me to what I think is a little bit more contrarian of an observation that I want to conclude with that is the heart of Dividend Cafe today, which is the absolutely unbelievable successful. Use appreciation of awareness of application of social capital relationship building, harnessing human beings in Warren Buffett&#39;s journey. You can say all you want, that he read corporate reports better than others, but to fail to recognize the way in which he tapped into a vast array of resources. The way to fail to recognize that is what all business organizational entrepreneurial success often comes down to is compounding from the benefits out of these additional relationships, networks, resources, connections. <br>There is an array of talent that nobody, no matter how bright they are, no matter how bright Warren Buffet is, can know all things. The leverage we get out of a diversity of relationships because of different people having diverse skills, people having diverse subject matter expertise, diversity of geography. Warren Buffett was based in Omaha, Nebraska, and Omaha Nebraska is not the financial capital of America, but he was very well networked in New York City. <br>He was very well networked in Silicon Valley. He was very well networked in Los Angeles, Southern California, in oil area and in insurance industry. And so there&#39;s geographical. Sector diversification that still does not come down to reading in a book or knowing just something about a particular company. The way in which this guy who clearly is far more extroverted than I am, I&#39;m a deeply introverted person, but I really recognize the benefits of how he put together salons, discussion groups, symposiums, they travel together and look not. Everybody is gonna get a private plane together and put eight muckety mucks on it and go to Bermuda for a weekend to talk about world peace or an economic challenge or whatever the case may be. <br>My point: he leveraged resources to do it in style. I&#39;m sure do it at a more elite level, but that&#39;s not really my point. My point is the basic connectivity. Human beings because of human action being the fundamental reality of economics, that economics being the study of human action, it starts with this diversity of human skill, ingenuity. <br>God created talent and giftedness that exists, and Buffet&#39;s ability to tap into it in a very profound way and building out over time organic. And doing this very non cynically, it was not transactional, but investing into the relationships and what not, that over time built a human resource network for him that became very rothers drama of the 1990s. And in him being the person that folks would tap into when there was need for desperate capital with Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, General Electric, out of the financial crisis. <br>There, there just there&#39;s an obvious sense in which Buffett was able to do this in a way. Most people are not, but there&#39;s also a less obvious sense in which the exact same principle. Is a hundred percent true for everybody as an investor, as a leader, as a business entrepreneur the relationships that we build and the investment that we put into these networks, social networks that leverage the giftedness of other humans. The connectivity and resources, these things compound over time the same way the information compounds over time that a reader like buffet can take in and the same way the capital compounds over time because of math. This is essentially a lesson of compounding, and Buffett was able to do it in a profound way, and I think that investment in these relationships is a wonderful lesson. For us to take in and understanding the ultimate legacy of Warren Buffett. <br>By the way, as I wrap this up, no need to send me emails on things. We don&#39;t like about Warren Buffett. That isn&#39;t my point. There&#39;s a lot of things I disagree with Warren Buffett personally and even investment wise. There&#39;s a lot of things I&#39;ve learned from him about it. That&#39;s true of all people. <br>But I am here today only to talk about those five things I just brought up. The fact that there&#39;s other things out there that people may like or dislike, is what he said about a tax policy here, a political thing here, other issue there. I&#39;m aware of those things already. I just wanna stick to the matter at hand. There&#39;s a lot to be learned in these things we talked about with Buffett [1] the longevity time value compounding, [2] the discipline fundamentals, [3] his self-fulfilling prophecy benefit, [4] the really evergreen benefit of being a voracious reader. And then finally [5] that true revelation and application about human capital, human connections, and investing in relationships that compound over time, <br>I believe not only makes one a better business success and yeah, in his case, made &#39;em worth the 150 billion. I would argue it makes for more fulfilling lives for all of us. Thank you as always for listening. <br>And watching and reading the Dividend Cafe. I hope you have a wonderful weekend. I look forward to seeing you Monday, where we get to get back to public policy, tax tariffs, Trump and all the things. In the meantime, have a wonderful weekend and let&#39;s go Knicks. </div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R262" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">263</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/16/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:4144px;left:-1px">SHARYL ATTKISSON KHÔNG HỀ BIẾT SỢ!<br>Hôm nay, Sharyl mở ra một hồ sơ sẽ làm nhiều người không muốn đọc vì quá rắc rối.

Kinh hãi!<br>https://sharylattkisson.com/.../read-judicial-watch.../<br>Judicial Watch exposes Biden team pressure on Special Counsel Hur<br>By Sharyl Attkisson | May 16, 2025<br>The following is from Judicial Watch.<br>Judicial Watch announced it received from the US Department of Justice in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit 49 pages of records detailing pressure asserted by Biden White House and Joe Biden’s personal lawyers on Special Counsel Robert Hur regarding the October 2023 interviews of then-President Biden in the criminal investigation into his theft, retention, and disclosure of classified records. Non-disclosure agreements signed by the president’s lawyers are also included in the records.<br>Judicial Watch filed a July 2024 FOIA lawsuit against the Department of Justice for all communications about the Hur report with the Office of the White House Counsel and Biden’s personal lawyers (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:24-cv-02179)).<br>Judicial Watch has several ongoing FOIA lawsuits about Biden’s document scandals and the related unprecedented partisan prosecutorial and judicial abuses of former President Donald J. Trump.<br>In April 2025, Judicial Watch uncovered Justice Department records showing White House staffers suggesting edits to transcripts of President Biden’s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur regarding his handling of secret documents.<br>In February 2025, a federal court ordered the Department of Justice to declare whether it intends to continue denying Judicial Watch’s request for the full audio of former President Joe Biden’s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. The Trump Justice Department has until May 20, 2025, to report its position on the release of the videotape.<br>In June 2024, the Biden administration was forced to admit that the transcripts of audio recordings of Biden’s interviews with Special Counsel Hur had been altered and are not accurate.<br>The new records include an October 18, 2023, letter, just a few days after Hur’s interviews of Biden, from Special Counsel to the President Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal attorney Bob Bauer to Hur. They express concerns about the release of the report:<br>    &quot;At our meeting last Friday, we requested that you provide an overview of where matters stand in this case, particularly any remaining questions or concerns we should address. We also asked for the opportunity to discuss your expected report to the Attorney General at the conclusion of the investigation, including time to review it prior to its submission to the Attorney General. You advised us that you were not prepared to engage with these requests at that time but would take them under consideration.<br>    &quot;Moreover, to the extent that your report touches in any way upon procedures in this or prior administrations for the handling of sensitive national security information, your report will also be read with intense interest in every foreign capital. It could affect the national security interests of the United States in ways that none of us can anticipate.<br>An October 31, 2023, email from Sauber to the Special Counsel’s Office documents the repeated efforts by the Biden legal team to review the report before its release. The letter states:<br>   &quot;In our October 18 letter to you, we asked to have the opportunity to review and comment on a draft of the “confidential” report that you are required to write under the Special Counsel regulations. We also noted that we would follow up on the subject of the Special Counsel’s “final report” requirement more broadly.<br>    &quot;At a minimum, the report should adhere to the kind of product contemplated by the Special Counsel regulations. As discussed, in contrast to the detailed independent counsel reports setting forth a “full and complete” description of their work, the Special Counsel regulations contemplate only that the Special Counsel will “explain[] the prosecution or declination decisions.” … We support your faithful fulfillment of this requirement. But, consistent with the Department’s description of a “limited” and “summary” product, … , the report should be economical. It should include the factual information necessary to the charging decision, but facts or events that are not essential to the decision have no place….<br>In a December 15, 2023,  2023, letter Sauber and Bauer reiterate the request and also ask for access to the classification review of the materials found and the return of the records of a personal nature to Biden.<br>In a January 3, 2024, letter Sauber and Bauer again reiterate the request for a pre-release review and express concern that the final report provide an “appropriate public presentation” of the facts of the case.<br>On January 5, 2024, “RKHSC,” (Robert K. Hur, special counsel) sends an email to Bauer and others discussing “nondisclosure agreement and certification.” The non-disclosure agreement and certification state:<br>NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT<br>    &quot;This agreement applies to the review by members of the White House Counsel’s Office and personal counsel of the report of the Special Counsel’s Office.<br>    Review will be limited to the following people: Ed Siskel (White House Counsel), Richard Sauber (Special Counsel to the President), Rachel Cotton (Senior Counsel to the President), Robert Bauer (personal counsel), and Jennifer Miller (personal counsel). This agreement refers to this group collectively as “counsel.”<br>CERTIFICATION<br>By this certification, I affirm to the Department of Justice that I have and will continue to adhere to the terms of the attached non-disclosure agreement …<br>I understand that Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, makes it a felony to knowingly and willfully make a materially false statement in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States.<br>On January 9, Bauer emails his and Jennifer Miller’s non-disclosure agreements and certifications to Hur and others.<br>In a February 5, 2024, letter to Hur, Sauber and Bauer outline their complaints about the draft report. The first concern they raise is the report’s characterization of Biden’s failing memory:<br>    &quot;We do not believe that the report’s treatment of President Biden’s memory is accurate or appropriate. The report uses highly prejudicial language to describe a commonplace occurrence among witnesses: a lack of recall of years-old events. Such comments have no place in a Department of Justice report, particularly one that in the first paragraph announces that no criminal charges are “warranted” and that “the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden’s guilt.” If the evidence does not establish guilt, then discussing the jury impact of President Biden’s hypothetical testimony at a trial that will never occur is entirely superfluous.<br>    “We are pleased to hear that the Trump Justice Department plans to release the Biden audio tapes in response to Judicial Watch’s FOIA lawsuit,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “These new records further show how desperate the Biden gang was to hide the full truth about Biden’s failing memory – and criminality.”<br>In the February 5, 2024, “Report of the Special Counsel on the Investigation Into Unauthorized Removal, Retention, and Disclosure of Classified Documents Discovered at Locations Including the Penn Biden Center and the Delaware Private Residence of President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.” Hur called Biden a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” and declined to charge Biden with a “serious felony:”<br>    We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory. Based on our direct interactions with and observations of him, he is someone for whom many jurors will want to identify reasonable doubt. It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him - by then a former president well into his eighties - of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.<br>Prior to the finalization of the report, the White House issued a letter to the Special Counsel’s office attacking the report’s “treatment of President Biden’s memory,” and added “there is ample evidence from your interview that the President did well in answering your questions …”<br>Read the full press release here.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R263" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">264</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/16/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2833px;left:-1px">MỘT NGƯỜI DA ĐEN NÓI THẬT…<br>VÀ LẬT MẶT NẠ BỌN DA ĐEN LÀM BỘ ĂN VẠ! <br>Trên The Spectator, một độc giả da đen viết về bọn dân cử da đen làm bộ đòi bồi thường thiệt hại cho dân nô lệ da đen thuở xa xưa tại Mỹ nhằm hốt phiếu cử tri da đen bằng… một ngàn tỷ tiền thuế của thiên hạ. <br>Quá dễ hiểu mà ít ai thấy ra hiện tượng đấm mõm ăn vạ!<br>https://thespectator.com/.../democrats-trillion-dollar.../<br>The Democrats’ trillion-dollar reparations racket<br>I couldn’t take a check in good conscience<br>(David Sypher Jr. - The Spectator - Friday, May 16, 2025)<br>Reparations<br>Rep. Summer Lee (D-PA) (Getty)<br>When politicians run out of solutions, they start offering symbolism – and this year, that symbolism comes in the form of a check.<br>Representative Summer Lee’s “Reparations Now” resolution calls for trillions of dollars in payments to black Americans as compensation for slavery and its aftershocks. As a black man in America, this issue cuts close to home. My grandparents came from South Georgia, and their grandparents were born into slavery. That blood runs through me. The pain, the endurance, the quiet strength – it’s part of my inheritance.<br>If reparations were handed out, I’d be one of the people eligible to receive them. But I couldn’t take the check in good conscience.<br>Because while I honor what my ancestors endured, I don’t believe their suffering should be reduced to a dollar amount. They didn’t survive for me to wait on a payout – they fought, worked and built so I could stand on my own. To accept that check would feel like trading in their dignity for dependency. My success – and even my setbacks – are mine. And that’s something they would’ve wanted: not a government handout, but a legacy of strength.<br>This isn’t just about money – it’s about narrative. And the story being told here is that black Americans remain helpless without government intervention, that our future is forever chained to our past. That’s not empowerment. It’s political theater.<br>The reality is that this narrative doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. The strongest predictors of success in today’s America are not race or historical trauma – but family structure, socioeconomic stability and cultural habits. This is not to deny the horrors of slavery or the devastation of Jim Crow. It’s to say that we are not defined by them.<br>A two-parent household is one of the greatest protectors against poverty, incarceration and poor educational outcomes – regardless of race. Strong families and disciplined values beat government checks every time. That’s the reality politicians like Summer Lee refuse to acknowledge because it doesn’t fuel their outrage machine or their fundraising campaigns.<br>If she truly wanted to uplift black America, she wouldn’t be demanding trillion-dollar reparations. She’d be pushing for school choice. She’d be fighting for small-business deregulation and access to capital. She’d be demanding that the welfare state stop punishing marriage and fatherhood in low-income communities. In other words, she’d be doing the hard, thankless work of restoring the cultural and economic foundations that make progress sustainable – not symbolic.<br>But instead, we get this: a flashy, impossible promise with no legislative future. Reparations have become the crypto of progressive politics – all hype, no stability and an easy way to get people emotionally invested in something that will never pay out.<br>Lee went even further, framing this as a historical inflection point: “This is a moment in time where societies are shaped and new societies are built. We should be the ones who are shaping it.”<br>It’s a stirring line, designed to evoke empowerment. But let’s not kid ourselves – it’s also fear-based messaging. It implies that unless we cash in now, black Americans will be locked out of whatever “new society” is coming. That unless trillions are handed down from Washington, the future will be forged without us.<br>That’s not just misleading – it’s disempowering.<br>There is no grand conspiracy to erase black people from the future. But there is a very real danger in telling generations of young black men and women that their fate depends on what politicians in DC decide, instead of the choices they make every single day. It’s the soft bigotry of low expectations – wrapped in the language of racial justice.<br>And here’s the real insult: the very government that oversaw slavery, enforced segregation and mismanaged public housing is now supposed to be the moral and economic savior of black America? The same system that failed us for generations is now being sold as our only hope? That’s not justice – it’s delusion.<br>And yet, every few years, right on schedule, the reparations debate gets revived – not because it’s politically viable, but because it’s politically useful. It galvanizes the base. It dominates the headlines. It keeps black Americans emotionally tethered to a party that has perfected the art of symbolic politics.<br>But what has that party delivered? Urban schools still fail. Black-owned businesses still struggle to access capital. The welfare state continues to discourage marriage and reward dependence. And violent crime is disproportionately concentrated in black neighborhoods run by the same leaders who claim to be our advocates.<br>This is the bait-and-switch of modern racial politics: trade in real empowerment for political theater. Promise trillions you can’t deliver while doing nothing to fix the structures that actually keep black communities stagnant. It’s not progress – it’s a trap.<br>What black America needs isn’t more apologies or empty resolutions. It needs a cultural restoration – one that prioritizes family, ownership, faith, discipline and education. We don’t need another round of grievance politics. We need to build.<br>That’s the real path to power. Not symbolic checks, but generational wealth. Not victimhood narratives, but legacy thinking. Not state-funded absolution, but community-led transformation.<br>If there’s a new society being built, we don’t need reparations to shape it. We need responsibility, resolve, and reality-based leadership. Because the future isn’t handed out – it’s earned.<br>And the people best positioned to lead black America forward aren’t those who exploit our pain for press conferences. They’re the ones building families, businesses and institutions despite the noise – quietly proving every day that we don’t need to be saved. We just need to be free.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R264" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">265</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/16/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:1833px;left:-1px">ĐỪNG LAY TÔI NHÉ, CUỘC ĐỜI!<br>Vừa mừng là hôm nay Thứ Sáu thấy Nellie Bowles chọc quê thiên hạ trên The Free Press thì mình lại bị cuộc đời lay động: <br>Thiên hạ tại Hoa Kỳ bị quê thật vì bao người ngợi ca thương chiến biết lùi của Trump thì niềm tin của giới tiêu thụ lại... lùi xuống dốc! <br>Từ 57% vào Tháng Ba, niềm tin tuột xuống 52,2% vào Tháng Tư và số sơ khởi cho Tháng Năm chỉ còn 50,8% - vì e sợ lạm phát.

And much more.<br>(By Nellie Bowles - The Free Press - 05.16.25 - TGIF)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Welcome back to your trusted week in review, written this week from the middle seat on my way to San Francisco for a Free Press debate. Our first flight was canceled after we sat in the plane for many hours, and I’ve slept very little, so I am ready for war. This week is a short one because of that, plus I have to prepare for the big event (attending the debate after-party, and wondering why my pinot noir is taking this long).<br>→ What kind of refugees wear cargo shorts: The Trump administration made good on its promise to allow certain white South Africans to claim refugee status in America. This week 59 Afrikaners (descendants of the mostly Dutch colonists who began settling in South Africa in the seventeenth century, also known as Boers) arrived on our pearly shores, hungry for biltong, ready to crack open a hard cider for a sundowner after the braai. Imagine explaining the Triple Dipper at Chili’s to these people. Everyone is being weird about their arrival, except, surprisingly, the Afrikaners. First, the Trump administration. Here’s what the deputy secretary of state said when welcoming the lucky 59: “When you have quality seeds, you can put them in foreign soil and they will blossom.” Quality seeds. He means genes, strong white Dutch seeds to be exact. The Danes and the Dutch are major sperm exporters, and so this week the Trump administration, yet again, agrees with America’s lesbians. Personally, I feel that blondes are fundamentally inbred, but to each her own, Mr. President.<br>Anyway, the Afrikaners really are fleeing persecution, and those denying it probably on some level think they deserve it - a little ancestral blood justice. But the farm murders are truly not a hoax, and a popular South African political leader named Julius Malema really does gather together huge crowds to chant things like: “Shoot to kill. Kill the Boer.”<br>Or as The New York Times has explained it: “Right-wing commenters claim that an old anti-apartheid chant is a call to anti-white violence, but historians and the left-wing politician who embraces it say it should not be taken literally.” It’s a metaphor, silly goose.<br>The African National Congress, South Africa’s governing party, is furious that Afrikaners are calling for help and gaining sympathy among the American right: “What the instigators of this falsehood seek is not safety, but impunity from transformation. They flee not from persecution, but from justice, equality, and accountability for historic privilege.” Impunity from transformation. Accountability for historic privilege. I can’t believe only 59 have left! My favorite part is that at the bottom of the ANC letter is a contact for media inquiries. Reach out to: Mangaliso “Stalin” Khonza, National Communications Manager. Indeed, his nom de communications guerre is Stalin. Pray tell, Stalin: What does transformation look like here?<br>MSNBC agrees with the idea that the Afrikaners must stay in South Africa and learn accountability. Here was a panelist named Rick Stengel: “These are the descendants of the people who created the most diabolical system of white supremacy in human history,” and “There’s just been a small handful of farmers that have been killed. . . it’s just a farce and a sham.” (It’s more than a handful.) So it’s evil that their ancestors went there, and also evil for their descendants ever to leave. Tricky puzzle, this one.<br>Then comes the Episcopal Church, which has been helping resettle refugees for decades but said they would not help the Afrikaners, and will instead entirely end their resettlement partnership with the U.S. government over it. “In light of our church’s steadfast commitment to racial justice and reconciliation and our historic ties with the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, we are not able to take this step.”<br>Two things can be true at once (and yes, I should get this phrase tattooed on my person): The Trump administration can embrace a more eugenic immigration philosophy genuinely at odds with Episcopalian beliefs (all souls being equal and such) and the Afrikaners can be legitimate refugees who are in danger. We’ve grown so accustomed to refugee applying only to “young men seeking economic opportunity” that we forgot that not all refugees are ambitious 23-year-old Moroccans looking to enjoy the greatness of capitalism! Me, I’m balanced: pro-immigration but neither racist nor anti-racist. I don’t care if you’re a Dutchman or a Moroccan. I just believe our border entry should be determined by a combination IQ and physical fitness test, a quick grade on baby-rocking ability, see how long it takes you to down a Triple Dipper, then Jordan Peterson personally deciding if you’re too neurotic, and boom - welcome to America. Here’s your Amazon warehouse tunic. Lekker? Lekker.<br>→ The new Statue of Liberty: Donald Trump is being gifted a jumbo jet by the Qataris. The administration says it’s being given to the Defense Department and then will go to Trump’s “presidential library foundation,” which I’m sure will be very real and very full of big books. Facing criticism, Trump reposted someone on Truth Social saying the plane is a gift from a foreign government, like the Statue of Liberty was a gift from France. Just like that. But does the Statue of Liberty have a minibar full of Diet Coke? [Quái chiêu!]<br>My favorite exchange on this whole thing was on Fox News, between Brian Kilmeade and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.<br>    Kilmeade: “Do you worry that if [the Qataris] give us something like this, they want something in return?”<br>    Leavitt: “Absolutely not, because they know President Trump, and they know he only works with the interests of the American public in mind.”<br>To be clear, I only work with the interests of TGIF in mind. So if someone wants to gift a briefcase of diamonds or a big private plane, TGIF might be interested in promoting your concrete company. Incentives: aligned! You’re welcome, TG readers. [Quái chiêu!]<br>Attesting to the legality of the gift from Qatar was United States attorney general and top blonde Pam Bondi, whose former job was working as a lobbyist for Qatar. [Nhắc nhở là đúng!]<br>→ Egg prices improving, which is bad, part of a fiction:<br>There is so much legitimately bad stuff the White House is doing day in and day out. A small, Chinese-linked company is investing $300 million into $TRUMP coin this week, to do more corruption right before our eyes. The jet! Don Jr.’s Executive Branch club! But CNN couldn’t let Trumpo have this one little win?<br>I guess grocery prices going up is a major narrative, so it must be stuck to. After the mainstream spent four years downplaying grocery inflation, NBC News announced this week that their new, always-on data journalism effort will track Trump-flation: “NBC News is tracking changes in the prices of eggs, bread, ground beef, chicken, and other grocery items to monitor the impact on consumers’ food bills.” I hope the vacation was gorgeous, guys. Great to have you back.<br>→ Recession is called off: JPMorgan has dropped its recession prediction, and now declares the U.S. economy is growing and everything is probably fine. And to think that two weeks ago, I was cutting up my books to hide gold in them. I myself can’t believe it, but Trump’s tariff gambit seems to have worked: China is reducing tariffs on U.S. goods to something like where they were before (from 125 percent back to 10 percent). And the U.S. will then drop our new 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods to a more humane, but still hefty, 30 percent. It worked? And nothing that bad happened along the way. Trump’s approval rating is even clicking up. I guess I was... sorry, I’m gagging a little... I guess I was wrong. Art of the... Lord, give me strength... deal.<br>→ Biden and Kamala continue their bickering: A top adviser to Kamala’s presidential run told authors of a forthcoming book that Biden screwed the campaign over, and that if he had only dropped out earlier, Kamala would have soared. Which makes no sense, because she became slightly less popular as she campaigned. It seems like if Biden would’ve quit just a couple months earlier, Doug Emhoff might have been in the East Wing today switching out the drapes and getting ready for SoulCycle in Georgetown. The new book details Biden’s aging, and the lengths people went to cover it up includes that his team planned for Biden to be in a wheelchair soon after the election. I need everyone involved in this to step away from public life. But they refuse. Last week, Joe and Dr. Jill Biden went on The View. The ladies asked him about the criticisms of his age, and he went on for a few minutes until Dr. Jill, our villain, swooped in to say how very hard he worked.<br>    The people who wrote those books were not in the White House with us, and they didn’t see how hard Joe worked every single day. I mean, he’d get up, he put in a full day, and then at night he would, I’d be in bed, you know, reading my book, and he was still on the phone, reading his briefings, working with staff. I mean, it was nonstop.<br>He put in a full day like a grown-up, she says, as Joe stares ahead, confused. Why is Joe all dressed up there at The View table anyway? Dr. Jill, just let him rest, good Lord. [Quái!]<br>→ Old people get enough already: Republicans have a new tax proposal that would give seniors another random $4,000 tax deduction. Why? Why not? They talk about wanting birth rates up, but the truth is, we’re in a gerontocracy. To prepare my children for the only bosses they’ll have, I softly sing to them:<br>Nibblin’ on sponge cake / Watchin’ the sun bake... Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville / Searchin’ for my lost shaker of salt / Some people claim that there’s a woman to blame / But I know / It’s nobody’s fault.<br>It needs to live in their bones so they stand a chance at a future here. So they know how to relate to their 115-year-old overlords.<br>→ Ode to David Hogg: Young David Hogg, recently elected a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, really is going to lose his seat and face another election. Because his election didn’t exactly follow the DNC gender-balance rules, determined each month based on the alignment of Saturn and the height of the waves. Yes, he is a man, and that cannot stand. David Hogg survived a school shooting and clawed his way to the top of the political food chain with savvy instincts, a quick wit, and a true passion for being on TV - only to be felled by his overwhelming maleness. My bet is that this is his villain origin story. When David Hogg is a red-pilled podcaster saying women shouldn’t have the right to vote, I want everyone responsible for this moment to reflect a little. David Hogg will be yukking it up with Tucker and the Saudis, and we’ll know that this was literally his only career path. The DNC will finally be run by a perfectly balanced tri-gender humanoid, and that humanoid will have lost every single election, and we’ll be paying for meals in Qatari riyals, but we’ll know that the genders are aligned - and balanced.<br>→ Keir Starmer is getting hardcore: Speaking of red-pilled, did someone hack Keir Starmer’s Twitter/X account? The prime minister of Britain, head of the Labour Party, is suddenly coming out fervently against immigration. “I’ve already returned over 24,000 people with no right to be here. And I won’t stop there,” he wrote this week. And another: “Settlement in the UK is a privilege that is earned, not a right.” On and on he went with this tough talk. Whoa there, Kier, if you want to go on a date with Tom Homan, just ask!<br>There’s a revealing interview on GB News with a young migrant whose answer to every question the reporter asks is “Give me.” It’s a little unfair because that is also the only phrase I learn in foreign languages (what else is needed besides that and “Is there a bathroom in these pyramids?”). Keir’s politics are now basically 2016 MAGA. He’s entering his Cinco de Mayo taco bowl era. (In Britain, to be 2025 MAGA is to risk arrest.)<br>Speaking of arrests, last week police in Kent, England, admitted they made a mistake when they questioned and detained a retired police officer in 2023 after he posted a warning about antisemitism in Britain. Responding to a tweet promoting anti-Israel marches, the retired officer wrote as a sarcastic critique: “One step away from storming Heathrow looking for Jewish arrivals... ” Six officers - six! - went to his home and handcuffed him, later detaining him in a jail cell for eight hours. They searched through his books, which included works by such authors as Free Press contributor Douglas Murray (suspicious), as bodycam footage captured an officer referring to his collection as having “very Brexity things.” Naughty naughty, you’ve been caught with Douglas. [Quái!]<br>Me, I have Douglas Murray manuscripts like you couldn’t imagine. I have worse. Charles Murray is squeezed between SCUM Manifesto and Camille Paglia. There are non–gentle parenting books, several very Brexity things, a little bowl of water and rose petals I leave for Hillary, and a labor-and-delivery book called Orgasmic Birth that my wonderful accountant sent me and, suffice it to say, it didn’t work. British police, upon seeing my shelves, would probably shoot themselves, except they’re unarmed, so they would just kind of paddle each other until they all fainted.<br>→ Gavin really, super duper means it this time: Gavin Newsom called for all California cities to ban homeless encampments and remove them “without delay.” Newsom provided cities with a model ordinance to implement to do so, and also released $3.3 billion to communities across the state to “expand behavioral health housing and treatment options for the most seriously ill and homeless in California.” Ending homeless encampments is something Gavin periodically announces over his 20-year career. Like the groundhog predicting spring, when it feels right, Gavin will wander through a tent city and shake someone awake from their relaxing fentanyl nap. Be sure to get this on camera, guys. [Trời ơi!] Alas, it is all part of the circle of life. Homelessness ends now, Newsom says every few months, at a podium, while the people around him melt. <br>More below, on the American pope, Theranos: The Sequel, and Where I TG. But first, an illustration from our dear friend, David Mamet:<br>→ Pope Leo’s brother is the best new character: Pope Leo’s brother, a self-described “MAGA type,” had his past tweets read back to him on Piers Morgan’s show. First of all, the pope’s brother agreed to go on Piers Morgan. Second of all, here was one that our man reposted: “These effing liberals crying about tariffs is just unreal. Do they not know that there’s a thing called video? Just listen to what this drunk [Nancy Pelosi] has to say in the mid-’90s, long before her husband had Grindr dates.”<br>And his narration now, as Brother of Pope, explaining it: “I posted it, and I wouldn’t have posted it if I didn’t kind of believe it. However, I had no idea that what was coming was coming this soon. And I can tell you, since then, I’ve been very quiet, biting my tongue.” Bro, this is your tongue-biting? Friends, we are in for a great papacy. The papacy is about to contend with an insane Facebook brother, who is also a Florida Man. There are going to be fights on the Vatican patio over who is running the barbecue that Europeans will simply be unable to comprehend. Romans: Prepare thyselves.<br>I don’t think I was really prepared for an American pope. The fact that the pope always spoke a language I didn’t understand added to his mystery and charisma. And I liked to imagine the pope emerging from the sky, virgin births without even needing the mother. Now the pope is a guy from Chicago whose brother is posting about Pelosi. Now the pope is being discovered in fancam footage from a baseball game. This pope has probably consumed a corn dog!<br>Louis, the Brother of Pope, also recounted how the now-pope used to “play priest” when he was little: “We used to play like boys and play boys’ games, whether it was sports, or cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, whatever it might be. Rob liked to play priest. ... He’d do his pretend saying mass, pass out holy Communion with the Necco wafers. . . . It was his thing.”<br>Last note on this is, I love how hard The Washington Post is working to make sure you never think the word hallelujah is from Hebrew.<br>→ UC Berkeley votes against Hindu Heritage Month: The UC Berkeley student senate voted against Hindu Heritage Month, citing “Hindu nationalism,” despite the university’s observing several other heritage months. Hindus are not allowed heritage time! Stop asking for heritage awareness, Hindus. You must sit in shame next to the Irish Pride group and the campus Israel club (it is an awkward combo in there, I gotta warn you). Certain heritages’ self-awareness needs to be suppressed, and UC Berkeley is adding Hindu to that list. The failed resolution had recognized contributions to the Berkeley community by people of Hindu heritage, and called on students to “support their Hindu peers on campus.” No. Stop asking. As your debutante arbiter of who is white, and what to do with edge cases, I’ll be clear: Greeks and Italians are ethnic and may celebrate, though not for a whole month, just a heritage week. Basically a food festival and that’s it. But Hindus are white. I can’t explain why but it’s true.<br>→ No fast math for you: Palo Alto Unified School District voted to remove honors biology as an option for the smart kids, after already having removed honors English, lest some advanced reader get to talk to other advanced readers (on this I support Palo Alto wholeheartedly). “They call it de-laning,” said Silicon Valley congressman Ro Khanna. “I call it an assault on excellence. I took many honors classes at Council Rock High in PA.”<br>Being somewhat familiar with Palo Alto, a wealthy, highly competitive school district, let me tell you what’s going on, just based on gut: The white parents are mad that the advanced classes are disproportionately Asian. And they think their kid will have a better shot at an Ivy League spot if it’s harder for the college to tell who’s smart and who is, like, really smart. But guys, colleges already will discriminate against the smart Asians. You don’t have to cancel biology to get there. [Quái chiêu!]<br>→ MAHA, what are you people doing: The EPA announced that it will reconsider acceptable limits of four PFAS “forever chemicals” in drinking water. It goes without saying, but the chemicals in question are linked to a number of serious illnesses. Where are you, my MAHA princes? It’s not all chickenpox parties, boys. It’s not all posting pictures of our latest tallow face moisturizer.<br>Credit where it’s due: Lee Zeldin, EPA administrator, said that the EPA will take action against stop-start technology, which turns off a car’s engine when it’s stopped. It is one of those random things that actually doesn’t help the environment at all but makes people feel good. A little environmental guilt is good, and I don’t want people placated by false idols (recycling, car engine turnoffs, paper straws, carbon offsets).<br>→ Sir, are you stealing our motto?: They say imitation is the highest form of flattery.<br>We love you, A.G. Because of your sweet nepo hands (takes one to know one), dropping the ball on everything interesting and hard in the hardest and most interesting time, we could leave and build something really fun. Wait, I think you’re late to the Intern Listening Session. They have feedback for you, A.G.

Of course that’s what it’s called.

Ending years of isolation of the Kremlin, the Trump administration has offered numerous concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin, raising hopes among some Western observers that the United States might be able to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine after more than three years of fighting. <br>So far, although Russia has shown an interest in engaging with Trump, there is little indication that it is prepared to wind down its military operations. But even if the administration’s efforts succeed in bringing the Russian government to the negotiating table, there is a far larger obstacle to achieving peace: Russia’s dramatic internal evolution since the war began.<br>The war in Ukraine is central to Putin’s legitimacy, leaving him no rational incentive to end it voluntarily. At least since the end of 2022, the Kremlin has portrayed its war in Ukraine as a “war with NATO,” and confrontation with the West has become a key element of the regime’s ideology. To truly end the conflict, therefore, will likely require little short of a change of regime in Moscow - and one driven by actors within Russia who neither benefit from the war nor align with Putin. The current U.S.-led effort to jump-start peace talks has largely set aside the more crucial question of a long-term strategy toward Russia, both under Putin and after Putin.<br>Already well before 2022, the character of the Putin regime had changed significantly, as Putin moved away from the West. For years, the Kremlin had been building an ultraconservative, revisionist ideology centered around antimodern values. After 2012, when Putin returned to the presidency, the Kremlin began tightening its grip on Russia’s elites, embracing an archaic militarism, and widening its repression of civil society. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and especially over the past year, however, that evolution has gone much further. Putin had expected a quick and cheap victory, not a protracted war; the situation has forced him to accelerate the restructuring of Russia’s political, economic, and social systems to tighten his grip on the nation. Along with a progressive militarization of the Russian economy, these changes have created severe tensions within the regime.<br>The United States ignores these internal changes at its peril. Rather than preparing for a postwar future of renewed relations with the United States and Europe, Putin has put Russia on a slippery slope of self-reinforcing and perpetual conflict with the West. If the regime gets its way over the next three to four years, Russia could arrive at a sociopolitical equilibrium that looks less like a capitalist authoritarian country with private-sector elites and more like a North Korean–style militarized autocracy. For the Kremlin, such an equilibrium could help it withstand even major challenges to its rule, as Pyongyang did during a devastating economic crisis in the 1990s. Moreover, given Russia’s large size and military strength, this kind of transformation could also pose profound risks to global security.<br>Yet Putin’s bid to remake the Russian state has also created new vulnerabilities for the regime. The Russian economy has become deeply imbalanced, with the country’s overwhelming dependence on oil revenues to support war-related fiscal expansion. Especially amid sinking global oil prices, this has made the Russian budget especially vulnerable to further sanctions. Moreover, tensions are emerging among Russian elites as a result of Putin’s efforts to push aside existing business leaders, bureaucrats, and others in favor of loyalists who adhere to the regime’s ideology or at least pay lip service to it, such as war veterans. To prevent Putin and his inner circle from consummating this transformation, the West will need to exploit these vulnerabilities. But this will require applying more economic and military pressure on Russia while simultaneously sending signals and offering incentives to potential elite dissenters - those most affected by the Kremlin’s rapid and forceful transformation of Russian society and who are potentially capable of stopping it.<br>RESTIVE ELITES<br>Political scientists have long identified three primary threats to autocracies: military defeats, popular uprisings, and palace coups. For nuclear-armed Russia, a full military defeat by an external power is implausible. Moreover, like other authoritarian regimes, the Kremlin has devoted major resources to neutralizing opposition forces within Russian society and has an extensive apparatus for suppressing potential uprisings. Nevertheless, the potential for a seizure of power by members of the existing bureaucratic hierarchy, supported by elements of the military and business elites, remains a significant risk. As a result, Putin has shifted much of the Kremlin’s focus to Russia’s elites.<br>Consider the Prigozhin mutiny. In June 2023, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Wagner, the Kremlin-supported private military company, was able to seize the city of Rostov-on-Don, including the Southern Military District headquarters overseeing the war in Ukraine, with no resistance. He also tried to march his men on Moscow. Few among the bureaucratic, business, and even military elites denounced the mutineers, exposing limited support for Putin. This weakness was underscored five days later, when Putin felt compelled to meet with Prigozhin and Wagner commanders to stabilize the situation, despite having publicly accused Prigozhin of treason. Although the crisis was quickly defused and Prigozhin was eliminated two months later, the mutiny dealt a significant blow to the regime.<br>The elites’ lack of loyalty to Putin in 2023 was no accident. Since the 1990s and the early years of this century, Russia’s business leaders and upper level bureaucrats have been focused on attaining economic independence - using Russia’s relatively open market for personal material gain. For many years, the Russia state allowed private sector capitalism to flourish relatively unimpeded. In their implicit contract with Putin, Russian elites ceded political authority in exchange for wealth and personal freedom, but they were not required to risk their lives or fortunes for the state or its leader. Nor did the Kremlin have much control over their business activities and sources of wealth. But the mutiny underscored for Putin that the country’s current business leaders and high-level bureaucrats cannot be relied upon at moments of regime crisis. At the same time, the Kremlin’s Mafia-like hierarchy of power is inherently fragile, relying on a shared belief in the leader’s strength and the regime’s perpetuity. Up to the present, this system has been largely held together by rents, primarily from hydrocarbons, making it susceptible to dangerous weakening by economic sanctions or the need to mobilize vast resources for war. These factors have made Putin’s Kremlin particularly vulnerable to shifts in perception among the top strata of Russian society.<br>THE END OF NORMAL<br>The Kremlin’s growing concerns about unreliable elites have been heightened by Russia’s fragile economic outlook. At first glance, despite over three years of sweeping sanctions and war, the economy has been resilient. Through much of the first couple years of war, the government was able to inject significant funds into the economy, thanks to the efficiency of the private sector, the use of large accumulated reserves, poorly structured sanctions, and windfall revenues in 2022. This fueled economic activity, wage growth, and rising demand. The regime could simultaneously finance the war, meet social obligations, and distribute economic rewards to elites. This apparent wartime boom sustained the illusion of normalcy. The war also created new opportunities, particularly through niches left by the exit of foreign businesses -  although these have now been exhausted.<br>Beneath the surface, however, the picture is bleaker. Military spending has spiraled out of control, creating a budgetary black hole. Defense spending has more than doubled, from $65.9 billion in 2021 to $149 billion in 2024, and continues to go up. Not the least of the growing costs are the huge incentives and signing bonuses the government must now pay volunteers to recruit them into the armed forces, as well as payments for North Korean “services.” (Thus far, the Kremlin’s payments to Pyongyang for ammunition and military participation are estimated to have reached $20 billion.) Putin’s May 2024 replacement of his longtime defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, with the economist Andrei Belousov, was intended to impose fiscal discipline on the military, but there have been few discernible efficiency gains. For 2025, military expenditure will amount to 32.5 percent of the entire federal budget. To maintain this level, the government is for the first time reducing social spending: clearly, Putin can no longer sustain the illusion of normality.<br>By shifting toward a mobilization economy, with the state as the primary customer not only for defense but across other key sectors, the government has created severe fiscal strain. In contrast with previous years with surpluses, the budget has run deficits since 2022 - $33 billion in 2022, $32 billion in 2023, and $34 billion (1.7 percent of GDP) in 2024. With no access to foreign capital, this seemingly small budget deficit will become more and more threatening every year. For now, it is being covered mainly by drawing on the National Welfare Fund, which as of April 2025 had only $35.4 billion in liquid assets.<br>    Putin is reshaping Russia’s elite in ways that echo North Korea’s social hierarchy.<br>To offset costs, the government is raising personal and corporate income taxes and cutting social spending more than 10 percent. Meanwhile, oil price declines have led to a tripling of the official budget deficit forecast, leaving remaining reserves barely sufficient to cover the gap. A further oil price drop or new sanctions could force even deeper cuts to nondefense spending. These cuts may affect elites too, for example, by reducing federal subsidies to potentially rebellious regions like Chechnya. The government has also resorted to printing money, further fueling inflation.<br>The labor market is equally strained. Worker shortages following Putin’s September 2022 mobilization and mass emigration have forced civilian sectors to raise wages to compete with the military. Consumer demand is increasingly met by imports, weakening the ruble and pushing prices up. To curb inflation, the Central Bank raised its key interest rate from 7.5 percent in July 2023 to 21 percent in October 2024; nevertheless, inflation reached 9.5 percent at the end of 2024 and exceeded 10 percent by March this year. Experts from government think tanks and institutions warn of a potential inflationary spiral. High interest rates also limit the viability of domestic borrowing. Along with interest rate hikes, exchange rate volatility has increased the risk of corporate defaults.<br>These intertwined issues have significantly raised the chances of broader economic destabilization. A global financial crisis, coupled with OPEC’s expansion of the oil supply, could sharply depress prices for Russian exports, leading to uncontrolled inflation and the collapse of the ruble. Even without such shocks, continued downward pressure on oil prices and new sanctions are likely to have devastating medium- and longer-term effects. Adverse economic trends may erode public confidence in the regime’s durability and shrink the rents available to elites, undermining the foundations of the existing hierarchy of power. To counter this risk, the Kremlin has accelerated its efforts to transition to a new model of political and social control and replace the most unreliable segments of the political and business elite with loyalists personally tied to Putin.<br>KOREAN COERCION<br>For Putin’s Kremlin, building a new kind of regime has involved several interconnected elements. One is a shift in official narratives about the war. Until the fall 2023, for example, state propaganda maintained that there was no war, only a “special military operation” - a strategy that allowed most citizens to carry on their ordinary routines. By late 2023, however, the state narrative began to shift, and the Kremlin began also to refer to a new permanent “war” with the West. The Kremlin also started talking about Russian elites in terms of their loyalty to the regime. In February 2024, Putin addressed the Federal Assembly, declaring that elites were no longer those who “lined their pockets in the 1990s” but rather the “workers and warriors” who were proving their loyalty through action. This rhetoric was quickly echoed by figures such as Alexander Dugin, the far-right ideologist, and Sergey Karaganov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, who had called for a nuclear strike on Poland in 2023, as well as various government officials. In June 2024 Alexei Chekunkov, a former investment banker who had become Minister for the Development of the Russian Far East, publicly criticized Russia’s entrepreneurial culture of the 1990s and proposed a model of “patriotic socialism” instead.<br>This new rhetoric has been backed by targeted actions against members of the elite and prominent cultural figures. The “almost naked party” scandal of December 2023 - when several show business figures were caught flaunting a defiant dress code - marked a fundamental shift in the relationship between the state and citizens. The Kremlin deemed such a display unacceptable in wartime and began asserting its right to intrude into private life -  something even the late Soviet Union, from the 1960s onward, generally avoided. With its heavy-handed reaction, the regime signaled for the first time an intent to regulate private behavior, using tactics increasingly reminiscent of North Korea or Iran.<br>To reinforce regime loyalty, Putin also launched, in February 2024, a new program to integrate top military veterans into the workforce. Called “Time of Heroes,” the initiative seeks to channel former soldiers who are handpicked for their fealty and management skills into political posts. Although local politicians initially resisted, and sought to exclude veterans from party lists in the September 2024 regional elections, graduates of the program were assuming regional leadership roles by the end of the year. Through processes such as these, the Kremlin has set out to incrementally replace traditional elites with its own loyalists. Along with the arrest of seven corrupt generals (including three former deputy ministers), Putin’s May 2024 sacking of Shoigu was part of an effort to address internal dissatisfaction about pervasive corruption in the military hierarchy. In fact, these changes to some extent echoed earlier demands by Wagner leader Prigozhin. Such purges also provide opportunities for officers actively involved in the Ukraine war to advance within the military hierarchy.<br>At the same time, the Kremlin has begun an increasingly aggressive effort to nationalize private-sector assets. In 2022, the government began seizing assets belonging to foreign owners who left Russia when the war started. The following year, it began a more limited effort targeting Russian-owned assets as well. As of March this year, over 411 companies both foreign and Russian, with a combined value of $30 billion, have been nationalized, representing about 5 percent of the total capitalization of the Moscow Exchange. But even these numbers do not reflect the broader effects of this campaign on the Russian business community. Informal threats of nationalization have become an effective way for the government to coerce business owners to cede their property to politically favored individuals at a minuscule share of its market price.<br>    A large share of Russia’s private assets are at risk of state seizure.<br>The government has also begun consolidating key industries under Kremlin-linked entities. Since mid 2023, the Kremlin-affiliated Roskhim group has expanded its dominance of the chemical sector. In February 2024, the Rolf car dealership was nationalized and subsequently transferred to a Kremlin affiliate. And in June of that year, Russia’s biggest online retailer, Wildberries, was taken over by regime-affiliated groups. In January 2025, the General Prosecutor’s Office also requested the nationalization of the Domodedovo airport near Moscow, on the grounds that its main owner has Turkish and UAE citizenship as well as Russian. In March, Vadim Moshkovich, the billionaire owner of Rusagro, Russia’s leading agricultural conglomerate, was arrested for alleged criminal fraud. Also this year, in a new tactic, the government has begun seizing property from some of the country’s largest business owners.<br>It no longer appears to matter what legal pretext the security forces use to justify these asset and property seizures or arrests. Increasingly present in these actions are various groups with coercive power, including current and former employees of state security agencies (including Putin’s body guards), and such figures as Ramzan Kadyrov, the former warlord and close Putin ally who is head of the Chechen Republic and who has a personal army. Amid the Kremlin’s dwindling revenue streams and growing demands from these groups, the redistribution of property has become a primary government resource. The exact mechanism of redistribution - whether through nationalization, criminal charges, or outright business takeovers - is irrelevant. The government now uses the law as a weapon to expropriate property from bona fide owners, including those previously seen as regime supporters. Loyalty no longer guarantees protection unless the target in question has informal access to Putin. As Russia’s available economic resources shrink, the regime’s only way to reward those with coercive power is by reallocating assets - often at the expense of even loyal business owners - further raising tensions within the elite.<br>A logical extension of the Kremlin’s property-redistribution campaign came this month, when the Constitutional Court ruled that the statute of limitations for disputes over privatization should begin not from the date of the transaction but from the completion of a prosecutor’s investigation identifying violations. This decision effectively eliminates any time limit on the review of privatization deals from decades earlier - many of which contain legal flaws. This means that a large share of Russia’s private assets are now at risk. This threat has been exacerbated by severe constraints on the outflow of private capital from Russia - both because of increased informal FSB control over capital movement and the short-sighted design of Western sanctions, which have effectively trapped private capital inside the country.<br>FORTRESS MENTALITY<br>The final piece of the Kremlin’s effort to remake the state is ideological change. At least since 2012 Putin has sought to build and enforce a dominant ideology built on illiberal values and historical revisionism. Once-marginal ideas from the Izborsky Club, an antimodern think tank, have increasingly gained mainstream acceptance, including the view that Russia is a “besieged fortress.” Yet the Kremlin has failed to offer a positive vision of the country’s future. Instead, in an effort to preempt dissent amid economic hardship, it has intensified efforts to isolate Russian citizens from independent information. Independent media have been crushed, and the number of political prisoners has surpassed that of the late Soviet period.<br>These interconnected measures reflect a comprehensive effort to build a state that will soon have many of the attributes of the North Korean model. Putin has adopted autarkic self-reliance and other ideas that appear to draw on North Korea’s Juche ideology - the doctrine formulated by Kim Jong Il in 1982 that seeks to foreground national economic and military self-reliance. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin has also forged a military alliance with Pyongyang and is now reshaping Russia’s elite in ways that echo North Korea’s social hierarchy.<br>The Kremlin is unlikely to abandon this project anytime soon. The inherent inflexibility of the mafia-state structure, the transformation of the elites (by self-selection before 2022 and forced restructuring since then) , the growing reliance on those with coercive power, and the effect of years of ideological indoctrination of the people have reinforced the regime’s shift toward a North Korean model. Moreover, the survival of the new system requires perpetuating the confrontation with the West, which has become Putin’s legitimating cause, as well as declaring periodical “victories” in this struggle. These forces have produced a vicious circle. The war in Ukraine has given rise to powerful, well-organized groups in Russia that have a vested interest in the conflict’s continuation and the exacerbation of the war with the West. Putin can no longer buy the support of public employees as he once did and now substitutes them with war beneficiaries such as defense industry workers, whose incomes have risen dramatically, as well as contract “volunteers” and their families, whose earnings have also increased several times over. These constituencies are better organized than public employees and, in the case of veterans, possess military experience that is desirable to the Kremlin. But their inclusion only further militarizes the state and heightens the risk of new conflicts as war and coercion become societal norms.<br>Comparing Putin’s new state to an updated version of the Brezhnev-era Soviet Union, as some Western analysts have done, is misleading. Unlike the Soviet elite of the late Cold War, who prioritized stability and coexistence with the West, Putin’s inner circle lack a coherent ideological framework or long-term vision. Communist ideology, for all its flaws, provided the Soviet leadership with a structured worldview. In contrast, contemporary Russia has no constructive development model. Dmitry Medvedev’s presidency from 2008 to 2012 (during which Putin served as prime minister) briefly hinted at a modernization agenda, but it yielded no substantial outcomes or long-term vision. By 2012, it was clear that Russia’s ruling elite was destined to lose under any global order. This has left the Kremlin with few options other than global destabilization and geopolitical blackmail, a strategy for which the Kim regime in Pyongyang provides a powerful model. In deciding on this course, Putin has also rendered futile any attempts to cajole, lure, or appease him.<br>A RUSSIAN RESCUE?<br>If Russia, with its large nuclear arsenal, were to make a full transition to North Korean autocracy, it would pose enormous geopolitical challenges. Such a regime would also be a natural close ally to China. But this trajectory is not inevitable. To succeed, the new model will require far greater state control over citizens’ lives and harsher curtailments of personal freedoms. Labor shortages and xenophobic tensions against migrants will heighten the challenge, raising the likelihood that the government will have to coerce the population on a larger scale.<br>The initial erosion of political freedoms in Russia - beginning with the Yukos affair in 2003 (when the company’s CEO and main shareholder was convicted of tax evasion and fraud) and culminating in the constitutional amendments of 2020 - was gradual and, for many years, offset by rising living standards or at least promises of stability. Now, the Kremlin has little to offer aside from rising taxes, price inflation, and harsher state interference. The primary victims will not be ordinary citizens but the business and bureaucratic elites, who have the most to lose and are most likely to be replaced by regime loyalists who lack independent power bases or private-sector wealth.<br>If the government continues to tighten repression at a time of diminishing resources and gloomy economic outlook, it could destabilize the country. Opposition from within the elite, fueled by systemic financial and governance pressures, could trigger a breakdown. Still, such crises might not result in immediate regime change, since Russia currently lacks the prerequisites that would be needed. As of now, no major and powerful elite group in Russia could clearly gain from unseating Putin. As a result, a partial collapse could lead instead to prolonged instability, akin to what has happened in Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro, but with the added risk posed by Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Still, the prospect of increased repression and redistribution of property, especially combined with some positive alternative, might encourage those who stand to lose most to confront the Kremlin.<br>The West is not irrelevant to Russia’s future. Western actions can either accelerate or impede the transformation of the Putin regime. Concessions that enable Putin to declare victory, not to mention achieve Ukraine’s outright defeat, could entrench him further in power. Moreover, the notion that a peace deal with Moscow will bring significant benefits to American business is an illusion. Many U.S. corporations have already lost billions of dollars in Russia; their assets were simply seized by the Kremlin and handed over to loyalists. In the absence of sweeping political change, there is no guarantee that the Kremlin will not do the same in the future. Alternatively, continued and stepped up Western military aid for Ukraine and increased sanctions on Russia could expose the regime’s vulnerabilities. But sanctions that are perceived as purely punitive risk strengthening Putin’s narrative that the West is an enemy of the Russian people.<br>For the United States and its allies, there is not much time left to steer Russia from its current path. So far, the West has failed to present a compelling postwar vision for Russia and a plan to achieve it - one that is realistic internationally and that can directly appeal to Russians themselves. Such a vision - when combined with Russia’s failure to achieve military success and effective sanctions designed to undermine the regime’s power structures rather than punish Russian society as a whole - could help send the right signal to disgruntled Russian elites, encouraging them to risk challenging Putin’s rule before their own situation deteriorates further. But if current trends are allowed to continue, Europe may soon encounter a completely militarized autocracy on its borders that is similar to North Korea’s in structure, and far more dangerous. And the United States might have to countenance a military union between Russia and China.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R267" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">268</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:6035px;left:-1px">ĐÊ TRÁNH RỦI RO – HOA KỲ CẦN THỂ HIỆN QUYẾT TÂM!<br>Trên tạp chí Foreign Affairs, hôm nay ba học giả đề cập tới rủi ro lớn vì quan hệ quá gay go giữa Trung Cộng và Đài Loan.

Even before Taiwan elected William Lai as its president, in January 2024, China voiced strong opposition to him, calling him a “separatist” and an “instigator of war.” In recent months, Beijing has ramped up its broadsides: in mid-March, the spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office labeled Lai a “destroyer of cross-Straits peace” and accused him of pushing Taiwan toward “the perilous brink of war.” Two weeks later, as Beijing launched a large-scale military exercise around Taiwan, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) circulated cartoon images that portrayed Lai as an insect. One image depicted a pair of chopsticks picking the “parasite” Lai out of a burning Taiwan.<br>This effort to dehumanize Lai reflects Beijing’s deep anxiety about the trajectory of cross-strait relations, particularly what China views as Lai’s desire to push Taiwan toward independence. Compared with his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, Lai has taken a stronger and more defiant stance in the face of growing Chinese threats to the island, as evident in his rhetoric and new policy measures. This March, Lai characterized Beijing as a “hostile foreign force” and announced a plan to implement 17 wide-ranging strategies to defend the island from Chinese infiltration.<br>China’s vilification of Lai echoes Beijing’s denunciations, roughly two decades ago, of Chen Shui-bian, then president of Taiwan. Beijing labeled Chen a “die-hard separatist” and “a troublemaker” who “is riding near the edge of the cliff, and there is no sign that he is going to rein in his horse.” Beijing escalated external pressure against Chen and worked with opposition parties within Taiwan to frustrate his political agenda. China did come dangerously close to using military force against the island in 2008 and might have gone through with it if Chen had been more successful in winning Taiwan’s public support for his referendum.<br>Beijing’s attitude now should very much concern Washington. China does not view Lai’s rule as merely a continuation of that of Tsai. Instead, Beijing sees Lai as a disruptor like Chen and is treating him much in the same way. Since Lai became president, Beijing has demonstrated growing willingness to use military might to intimidate and punish the island. And it is far more prepared to use force against Taiwan today than it was 20 years ago.<br>Apparent divisions within U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration about how to approach Taiwan compound these risks. If Beijing doubts U.S. commitments to the island, that could encourage China to engage in more coercive actions against Taiwan. All these factors dramatically increase the chances that Beijing will miscalculate - and that it could very well use force against the island around 2027, as China approaches critical military modernization milestones and Taiwan gears up for its next presidential election.<br>ESCALATION SPIRAL<br>China’s official narratives have long emphasized that its peaceful unification with Taiwan is inevitable. But in recent months, anxiety has mounted in Beijing that Lai intends to systematically decouple Taiwan from China. Chinese media outlets have accused Lai of militarizing Taiwanese society as Lai prioritized efforts to increase Taiwan’s defensive resilience, reinstated the military court system to handle espionage and treason by Taiwan military officials, and accelerated training and preparations for the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Beijing is highly critical of Lai’s efforts to thwart Chinese infiltration and to counter Chinese cognitive warfare, arguing that Lai is preventing the resumption of tourism, suppressing and prosecuting pro-Chinese groups and individuals, discouraging Taiwanese citizens from applying for Chinese identification documents, imposing barriers on academic collaboration between universities in China and Taiwan, and altering Taiwan’s textbooks to undermine historical and cultural affinity.<br>In March, a Chinese government spokesperson claimed that Lai’s 17 strategies were aimed at “obstructing exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait.” China has also denounced Lai’s efforts to encourage Taiwanese businesses to invest more in democratic countries, including in the United States. Beijing has cast these measures as doomed to fail and mocked Taipei when the United States threatened to impose high tariffs on the island in April.<br>Many Chinese analysts believe that Lai’s political position is weak compared with that of his predecessor, Tsai. But they worry that this weakness may make Lai bolder, as he might want to ramp up confrontation with China to try to win public support.<br>Based on this analysis of Lai and domestic conditions in Taiwan, hawkish voices within China are urging an ever more aggressive approach toward Taiwan. Some are calling for the use of military force against the island or the resurrection of so-called civil war operations, nonpeaceful ways for Beijing to unify with the island, such as by imposing a maritime blockade of the island. Other hawks have publicly wondered whether Beijing can engineer a crisis in Taipei similar to the 1936 Xian incident, in which generals serving under Chiang Kai-shek - who was leading the government of the Republic of China and its Nationalist forces - seized Chiang and forced him to ally with the Chinese Communist Party to fight against Japanese forces that had invaded northern China.<br>A more resonant parallel may be to one of the most dangerous periods during Chen’s tenure. To boost turnout in Taiwan’s March 2008 presidential election, Chen paired that vote with a popular referendum on whether the island should join the United Nations under the name Taiwan instead of the Republic of China.<br>This proposal came perilously close to crossing a redline for Beijing: in 2005, Beijing had passed the Anti-Secession Law, which established China’s right to use military force against Taiwan under several conditions, including if “major incidents entailing Taiwan’s secession from China should occur.” When the law was passed, a spokesperson for the Chinese government suggested that an island-wide referendum could be considered a major incident. And in 2007, after Chen proposed the referendum, Chinese President Hu Jintao warned U.S. President George W. Bush that Beijing interpreted the Taiwan referendum in this way.<br>Beijing accompanied these warnings with significant military signaling. China increased its deployment of short-range ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan sevenfold from the beginning of Chen’s term in 2000 to early 2008. Before the referendum, the Bush administration detected that the PLA had put mobile short-range missile units near the Taiwan Strait on heightened alert. The U.S. military and intelligence community believed that China could fire missiles around Taiwan, as it had during the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis - or, worse, China could actually attack the island.<br>Fortunately, the 2008 crisis passed without bloodshed. Low voter turnout invalidated Chen’s referendum, and the opposition Kuomintang candidate beat the candidate from Chen’s Democratic Progressive Party in the presidential race. U.S. deployment of significant forces near Taiwan may also have given Beijing pause. Taking the risk of escalation seriously, Washington had publicly opposed Chen’s referendum and positioned two aircraft carriers to the northeast and southeast of Taiwan, and a third near Singapore, ahead of the vote. Nevertheless, the episode suggested that Beijing was serious about using force if provoked by what it viewed as “pro-independence” activities.<br>BAD OMENS<br>Since the 2008 crisis, China’s military capabilities have grown significantly. Its army, navy, and air force have rapidly modernized, and its conventional rocket forces now field a far more capable array of longer-range missiles, including advanced hypersonic and antiship ballistic missiles. China has also doubled the size of its nuclear arsenal over the past five years. Beyond advances in hard capabilities, Chinese President Xi Jinping has launched sweeping organizational reforms to enable the PLA to conduct more joint high-tech operations, and he has waged unparalleled anticorruption campaigns to root out obstacles to military readiness.<br>Beijing’s willingness to use its military is growing, too. China has long engaged in military exercises to hone its capabilities and intimidate Taiwan. During Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou’s tenure from 2008 to 2016, Beijing limited these provocations as it sought to encourage greater cross-Strait engagement. But China resumed major exercises when Tsai, who emphasized Taiwan’s sovereignty and security, succeeded Ma. In August 2022, toward the end of Tsai’s term, China mounted larger and more provocative drills near Taiwan than it had ever held before.<br>Now the pace and scale of Chinese military activities are increasing. Not even a year into Lai’s term, China has broken precedent by staging three large-scale exercises, which were given names to raise their profile and distinguish them from smaller drills.<br>In a significant shift, the PLA is now using such large-scale military exercises to punish Lai’s administration for domestic political acts. All of China’s past major exercises - in 1995–96, 2022, and 2023 -were launched after Taiwan’s leaders traveled to the United States or met with senior U.S. officials. Last December, China did engage in a major - but unnamed - drill after Lai made stops in Hawaii and Guam on a tour of the Pacific. But all three recent large-scale exercises responded to domestic speeches or statements by Lai.<br>These military activities have become markedly more provocative, unpredictable, and complex. In April’s exercise, named Strait Thunder-2025A, PLA naval vessels reportedly ventured within 24 nautical miles of the island’s shores. China is engaging in large-scale operations around Taiwan year round and increasing activities to the east of Taiwan. In a break with the past, the PLA now provides little or no advance warning of its drills. This has raised concerns in Washington and Taipei about how much lead time the United States and Taiwan might have should China decide to use force to seize the island.<br>In another shift from earlier years, recent rounds of exercises have witnessed China’s coast guard joining with the navy to practice blockading Taiwan. China’s maritime militia, a state-backed network of civilian vessels often deployed to assert Chinese territorial claims, has also become increasingly involved. The participation of these new actors suggests that China is preparing to conduct a broad variety of operations, such as an invasion, a PLA navy–led blockade, and a Chinese coast guard–led quarantine of Taiwan.<br>Finally, China is also operating across a bigger geographic range: its exercise in December involved one of the largest-ever deployments of maritime forces from all three of the PLA’s coastal commands. China conducted operations around Taiwan and in the East China and South China Seas, demonstrating its ability to dominate areas within the first island chain - an arc of islands and countries in the Western Pacific stretching from Japan to parts of Indonesia - and block external forces from entering to assist Taiwan.<br>Apart from such major operations, China now conducts near-daily military incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, a self-declared area that extends beyond the island’s official airspace. In 2024, the Chinese military flew a record-shattering 3,075 sorties into this zone, an increase of over 80 percent from 2023. These operations aim to delegitimize Taiwan’s claims to its surrounding air and seas and complicate Taiwan’s ability to monitor and track activities around the island.<br>Some of these air incursions occur as part of “joint combat readiness patrols,” involving not just air assets but also coordinated maritime operations. These patrols are now occurring on a near-weekly basis and offer China opportunities to quickly step up coercion against Taiwan short of much larger-scale exercises. Days after Lai unveiled his 17 strategies in March, for instance, China launched two joint combat readiness patrols and then followed up two weeks later by holding its Strait Thunder-2025A exercise.<br>WILD CARD<br>U.S. officials are issuing warnings about these remarkable Chinese military activities. In February, Samuel Paparo, the head of the U.S. military’s Indo-Pacific Command, asserted that China’s “aggressive maneuvers around Taiwan right now are not exercises.... They are rehearsals.”<br>               &quot;Washington must ensure that China clearly understands the resolve of the United States.&quot;<br>Yet as China increases its military activities against Taiwan, many in Beijing don’t know where Washington stands. Beijing is relatively confident that the Trump administration wants to intensify competition with China, with a particular focus on the economic relationship. Chinese analysts also generally believe that Trump will try to use Taiwan as a card in this competition, but there is no consensus on how he will do so.<br>Chinese experts assess that Trump and his team are divided on Taiwan. Many believe that Trump wants to negotiate deals with China and that he and many of his supporters want to avoid foreign military entanglements. But national security hawks in the administration, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, are still focused on checking Chinese aggression and influence. Chinese interlocutors note that Trump’s national security team is not receptive to Chinese concerns about Lai, and they worry that when it comes to day-to-day Taiwan policy, this administration will likely strengthen relations with Taipei through deepened cooperation and increased arms sales.<br>These conflicting assessments leave Beijing less certain that the United States will defend Taiwan from large-scale attacks or lower-intensity scenarios. But Chinese officials believe that, if left unchecked, the United States is likely to move even closer to Taiwan. That creates a dynamic ripe for miscalculation. China could determine that it needs to treat Taiwan more aggressively to make it clear to Trump’s national security team that it will tolerate neither growing U.S.-Taiwan ties nor moves by Taiwan that it sees as provocative. Meanwhile, China’s perception that Trump is not altogether willing to defend Taiwan may lead Beijing to consider still more escalatory actions against the island.<br>COURSE CORRECTION<br>U.S. and allied policymakers must not overlook these shifts in China’s perceptions of Taiwan and its actions regarding the island. As Lai’s term continues, Beijing and Taipei are likely to enter an even more dangerous situation. Chinese experts believe that Lai may take more radical measures to promote Taiwan’s independence in 2027 ahead of the next presidential elections. If Lai is not faring well in the polls, Chinese analysts worry that he could ratchet up his anti-Beijing stance to win electoral support, much as Chen did in 2008. Xi himself has set a deadline of 2027 for the PLA to have the capability to forcefully take Taiwan. Given Xi’s push to accelerate the PLA’s modernization, it is unlikely that his military leaders will tell him in 2027 that China is not capable of successfully executing large-scale military operations against Taiwan, meaning that Xi may feel more confident then - and willing to provoke a crisis or conflict.<br>Beijing’s diminished patience and hardened intent make it even more important for the Trump administration to ensure that China clearly understands the resolve of the United States and its willingness to counter Chinese aggression. There is extraordinary work that the United States must do to deter a conflict or, failing that, to deny and defeat Chinese military adventurism. In addition to building up its own military capabilities - as well as those of Taiwan and its allies - and significantly increasing allied and partner defense spending, Washington must better integrate different elements of U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan to enhance deterrence and reduce the risks of misperception by potential adversaries. <br>This is important because Beijing is not just assessing American resolve by looking at what the United States is doing on defense. For example, as Chinese experts watch the U.S.-Chinese tariff and trade negotiations, some are noting how rapidly Washington has both scaled up and temporarily backed down on tariffs, suggesting that Trump was bluffing initially and that the administration now recognizes that it needs to cooperate with China despite its focus on competition.<br>As the United States is moving fast on multiple fronts, it will be important to pay attention to how Beijing may be connecting the dots of different U.S. policies in cobbling together a larger understanding of American strategy and intentions. To the extent that China is misunderstanding the United States, it will be crucial for the Trump administration to correct and push back against Chinese narratives, both in public and in private.<br>If the Trump administration does not want a crisis on its hands, it should not leave such a door open for Beijing. The Taiwan Strait will be volatile enough over the next few years without adding to the mix muddled Chinese perceptions of what the United States is willing - or not willing - to do.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R268" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">269</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:4316px;left:-1px">THẮNG RỒI ĐÃ VẬY – MÚA GẬY… DẠY CON!<br>Sau mấy ngày công du tráng lệ, Donald Trump phải thấy tình hình hơi tệ ở nhà, khi đảng Cộng Hòa lo vượt ải ngân sách.

He’ll have to take a stand.<br>Kimberley A. Strassel<br>(By Kimberley A. Strassel - WSJ - May 15, 2025 5:12 pm ET)<br>image<br>President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the White House in Washington, Feb. 10. Photo: Alex Brandon/Associated Press<br>With House Republicans in the endgame of their reconciliation bill - and at an impasse - Speaker Mike Johnson may soon have no choice but to call in the big guns. At which point we’ll find out if the political howitzer known as Donald J. Trump sides with his own agenda of reform - in which he has already invested significant political capital - or with Republican Party business as usual.<br>The current House GOP standoff boils down to the usual: To spend or not to spend. To date, the spenders - or as the media charitably describes them, the “moderates” - have run the table. Their initial demands required House leaders to set a pathetic target of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years, allowing the Joe Biden spending boom to stand and grow. They then proceeded to throw up roadblock after roadblock in the way of even that $1.5 trillion mark. Congress remains littered with their red lines: No reining in ObamaCare’s Medicaid expansion. No messing with prior “infrastructure” spending. No serious overhaul of food assistance. No starting any real reform until 2029, so that lawmakers have time to roll it back.<br>To add injury to entitlement, they are demanding that any money saved - over their objections - be earmarked for their voters. Having already won a promise that they’d get a reprieve from today’s $10,000 cap on deductibility of state and local taxes, no amount will suffice. Double isn’t good enough. Nor is triple or quadruple. New York Republicans suggested this week that they might consider voting for a GOP bill that spares the country $4.5 trillion in tax hikes - but only if their constituents are allowed to deduct $80,000 worth of state and local taxes from their federal returns. Most Americans don’t even earn $80,000.<br>But the cheek that tipped conservative frustration into fury was Wednesday’s additional demand from 14 “moderates” - on top of their SALT extortion, on top of their reform roadblocks - to continue spending with abandon on Joe Biden’s Green New Deal. Virginia’s Rep. Jen Kiggans issued the group declaration taking issue with reconciliation plans to tighten boondoggle tax credits to climate companies, since “clean energy” matters. Read: Continued corporate subsidies are vital for our re-election.<br>House Republicans who still believe in limited government and spending restraint have been largely overlooked in all the focus on the moderate braying. Their warnings were largely ignored, as leaders catered to the squeaky wheels of Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon and New York Rep. Mike Lawler. But the fiscal hawks are no less necessary to passing this bill, given that Mr. Johnson can’t lose more than three votes. And they’ve now more than had it. Texas’ Rep. Chip Roy suggested he would vote against the legislation in a planned Friday Budget Committee meeting, and he’ll have company on the floor if changes aren’t made. An equally fiery group of Senate conservatives is throwing down a similar challenge.<br>These intraparty chasms may now be too wide to be bridged, which means the more likely path to a bill - if one even remains - is for one side to bend. Only one figure in the party has the political muscle to force such an outcome. The president has kept deliberately quiet in public about the state of negotiations and his own preferences. The assumption was always that he’d engage at the end, when the time came to knock heads into line over final outstanding questions. Only where does he now come down?<br>That will be the test of whether he actually believes in the reforms he promised on the campaign trail and the actions he’s taken his first months. What was the point of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency - and the media and litigation onslaught -  if Congress whiffs on even the basic cuts and changes necessary to lock in DOGE’s work? What’s the point of the president’s farsighted actions to unleash American energy, if Congress is knee-capping it with distortionary renewable subsidies?<br>Why should the president have even weathered the political storm that came from stating important truths - Medicaid has a lot of waste and fraud, work requirements should accompany welfare, the climate agenda is punishing American businesses and consumers - if Republicans in Congress ultimately surrender to the left’s talking points? For Mr. Trump, standing his ground is the obvious course, especially because voters’ belief that he would do what he says is what won him the office.<br>Yet don’t discount the populist whisperers, who seek to reduce this debate to simple vote-buying. They are telling Mr. Trump he needs to up the SALT ante to buy the New York and New Jersey House seats; to water down welfare reform to buy more low-income voters; to abandon Medicaid changes to buy “working class” support. Never mind that vote-buying is the Democratic Party’s approach to elections - and look how that’s turned out.<br>Either way, enter Mr. Trump. The party will need some pushing to get this done. Watch carefully in what direction Mr. Trump shoves.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R269" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">270</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:4283px;left:-1px">CHRISTINE LAGARDE LẠI PHẢI LÀM JEANNE D’ARC!<br>Tổ chức WEF (World Economic Forum) do Klaus Schwab sáng lập từ hơn nửa thế kỷ lâm khủng hoảng nặng nề.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images<br>Jack Phillips<br>(By Jack Phillips - The Epoch Times - 5/15/2025)<br>President Donald Trump on Thursday morning weighed in on the U.S. Supreme Court hearing arguments in a case involving his order to limit birthright citizenship, arguing that the current law is being exploited.<br>Earlier this year, Trump issued an executive order to limit birthright citizenship, which was halted by several federal judges. The case is now in the hands of the Supreme Court after the administration submitted an emergency appeal to the highest court.<br>“Big case today in the United States Supreme Court. Birthright Citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent Citizens of the United States of America, and bringing their families with them, all the time laughing at the ‘SUCKERS’ that we are!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday.<br>He said the United States “is the only Country in the World that does this, for what reason, nobody knows - But the drug cartels love it!”<br>Going further, Trump said that the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which was ratified in 1868 and three years after the end of the Civil War, was designed to provide citizenship to children born to enslaved people.<br>“Remember, it all started right after the Civil War ended, it had nothing to do with current day Immigration Policy!” Trump wrote.<br>The first sentence of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment reads: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”<br>It and the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery except as punishment for a crime, were ratified about a decade after the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision. That decision upheld slavery in U.S. territories and states while denying that black people could be considered citizens.<br>On his first day in office, Trump issued an order that made reference to the Dred Scott case, with the White House stipulating in a statement that the 14th Amendment “has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.”<br>“The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not ’subject to the jurisdiction thereof,&#39;” the White House said.<br>Birthright citizenship is among several issues, many related to immigration, that the administration has asked the court to address on an emergency basis, after lower courts’ rulings hampered the president’s agenda.<br>In Thursday’s arguments, the nine justices will be weighing whether judges have the authority to issue what are called nationwide, or universal, injunctions. The Trump administration, like the Biden administration before it, has said that judges are overreaching by issuing orders that apply to everyone instead of just the parties before the court.<br>The administration is asking for the court orders to be reined in, not overturned entirely, and spends little time defending its executive order on birthright citizenship. The Justice Department points out that there has been an “explosion” in the number of nationwide injunctions issued since Trump retook the White House. The far-reaching court orders violate the law as well as long-standing views on a judge’s authority, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote on behalf of the administration in its petition.<br>One of the judges who ruled against the administration, Judge Danielle Forrest of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote in February that the government has not been able to argue that the current circumstances “demonstrate an obvious emergency” to issue the order.<br>A separate ruling issued by the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also blocked Trump’s order.<br>“The Government expressly declines to make any developed argument that it is likely to succeed on appeal in showing that the Executive Order is either constitutional or compliant with” federal law, the court said in a unanimous decision.<br>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R271" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">272</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2433px;left:-1px">REUTERS THIẾU CHUYÊN NGHIỆP<br>THẬM CHÍ BẤT LƯƠNG TRONG ĐỀ TỰA!<br>Hồ sơ &quot;birthright&quot; có nhiều nguyên nhân phức tạp mà hệ thống truyền thông quốc tế này làm như trăm tội là vì Trump.

None of the justices, however, signaled an endorsement of Trump&#39;s order and some of the liberals said it violates the Constitution and the court&#39;s own precedents.<br>The justices heard more than two hours of arguments in the administration&#39;s emergency request to scale back the injunctions blocking Trump&#39;s directive, which is a key part of his hardline approach toward immigration. Three judges found that Trump&#39;s order likely violates the Constitution&#39;s 14th Amendment citizenship language.<br>Trump signed his order on January 20, his first day back in office. It directed federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of U.S.-born children who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident, also known as a &quot;green card&quot; holder.<br>Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said she believes Trump&#39;s order violates multiple Supreme Court precedents concerning citizenship. Sotomayor said the court should weigh the order&#39;s legality &quot;if we are worried about those thousands of children who are going to be born without citizenship papers that could render them stateless&quot; and leave them ineligible for government benefits.<br>More than 150,000 newborns would be denied citizenship annually if Trump&#39;s order takes effect, according to the plaintiffs who challenged the directive, including the Democratic attorneys general of 22 states as well as immigrant rights advocates and pregnant immigrants.<br>The case is unusual in that the administration has used it to argue that federal judges lack the authority to issue universal injunctions, and has asked the justices to rule that way and enforce Trump&#39;s directive even without weighing its legal merits. U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, arguing for the administration, focused on this issue, calling the increasing use by judges of universal injunctions a &quot;pathology.&quot;<br>In potentially restricting the ability of lower courts to issue universal injunctions in certain instances, the conservative justices raised the idea of requiring plaintiffs to funnel claims seeking broader relief into class-action lawsuits, which are filed on behalf of a group of people who suffer similar legal injuries.<br>Complicating matters, some justices - conservatives and liberals alike - also seemed reticent to rule without further delving into the underlying legal merits of Trump&#39;s directive. It remained uncertain whether the court would order further briefing, which would further delay resolution of the case.<br>Conservative Justice Samuel Alito asked Kelsi Corkran, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, &quot;Should we decide or make up our minds on the underlying birthright citizenship question without briefing and argument and deliberation?&quot;<br>Corkran said the justices should take up the case specifically on the merits of Trump&#39;s order, adding, &quot;The government is asking the court to allow it to ignore this court&#39;s precedents ... and to upend 100 years of executive branch practice.&quot;<br>The plaintiffs argued that Trump&#39;s directive violated the 14th Amendment, which long has been understood to confer citizenship on almost anyone born on U.S. soil. It was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War that ended slavery in the United States.<br>The 14th Amendment&#39;s citizenship clause states that all &quot;persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.&quot;<br>The administration contends that this citizenship language does not extend to immigrants in the country illegally or immigrants whose presence is lawful but temporary, such as university students or those on work visas.<br>&#39;ALL KINDS OF ABUSES&#39;<br>Without a universal injunction blocking Trump&#39;s order, it could be years before the Supreme Court finally decides its constitutionality, liberal Justice Elena Kagan said.<br>&quot;There are all kinds of abuses of nationwide injunctions,&quot; Kagan told Sauer. &quot;But I think that the question that this case presents is that if one thinks that it&#39;s quite clear that the (executive order) is illegal, how does one get to that result in what time frame, on your set of rules without the possibility of a nationwide injunction?&quot;<br>Sauer noted that after the dispute percolates in lower courts, the Supreme Court can ultimately pronounce on the legal merits of the policy, prompting conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett to express skepticism.<br>&quot;Are you really going to answer Justice Kagan by saying there&#39;s no way to do this expeditiously?&quot; Barrett said.<br>Sotomayor compared Trump&#39;s directive to a hypothetical action by a president taking away guns from every American who owns one despite the constitutional right to keep and bear arms.<br>Sauer said that since Trump returned to the presidency, federal judges have issued 40 universal injunctions against his administration&#39;s policies.<br>&quot;This is a bipartisan problem that has now spanned the last five presidential administrations,&quot; Sauer said.<br>VARIATIONS BY STATE<br>The administration is seeking to narrow the injunctions to apply only to the individual plaintiffs and the 22 states, if the justices find the states have the required legal standing to sue. That could allow the policy to take effect in the 28 states that did not sue, aside from any plaintiffs living in those states.<br>Jeremy Feigenbaum, the lawyer arguing for the states, said states face high and costly hurdles in managing difficulties in distributing government benefits if the order takes effect and citizenship is applied in a patchwork fashion, adding that class-action cases are &quot;not available for state litigation.&quot;<br>Feigenbaum said the legal issue surrounding Trump&#39;s executive order was resolved by the Supreme Court 127 years ago.<br>An 1898 Supreme Court ruling in a case called United States v. Wong Kim Ark long has been interpreted as guaranteeing that children born in the United States to non-citizen parents are entitled to American citizenship. The administration has argued that the court&#39;s ruling in that case was narrower, applying only to children whose parents had a &quot;permanent domicile and residence in the United States.&quot;<br>The 14th Amendment overrode an infamous 1857 Supreme Court decision called Dred Scott v.

CASA on the growing use of national or universal injunctions. This is a matter submitted on the “shadow docket” and the underlying cases concern the controversy over “birthright citizenship.” However, the merits of those claims are not at issue. Instead, the Trump Administration has made a “modest request” for the Court to limit the scope of lower-court injunctions to their immediate districts and parties, challenging the right of such courts to bind an Administration across the nation.<br>The case is the consolidation of three matters: Trump v. CASA out of  Maryland; Trump v. Washington out of Washington State, and Trump v. New Jersey, out of Massachusetts. These cases also present standing issues since the Administration challenges the argument that there is a cognizable “injury” to individuals who may travel to the states bringing the actions.<br>However, the main question is the scope of injunctions.<br>As I have previously written, district court judges have issued a record number of injunctions in the first 100 days of the Trump Administration. Under President George W. Bush, there were only six such injunctions, which increased to 12 under Obama. However, when Trump came to office, he faced 64 such orders in his first term.<br>When Biden and the Democrats returned to office, it fell back to 14. That was not due to more modest measures. Biden did precisely what Trump did in seeking to negate virtually all of his predecessors’ orders and then seek sweeping new legal reforms. He was repeatedly found to have violated the Constitution, but there was no torrent of preliminary injunctions at the start of his term.<br>Yet, when Trump returned to office, the number of national injunctions soared again in the first 100 days and surpassed the number for the entirety of Biden’s term.<br>This is a rare argument. First, it is a shadow docket filing that usually results in summary decisions without oral argument. Moreover, this matter came after what is commonly viewed as the final day for oral arguments. The Court granted a rare late oral argument, reflecting that multiple justices view this matter sufficiently serious to warrant a break from standard operating procedures.<br>Rather than arguing a “question presented” on birthright citizenship, the Administration is solely looking for limits on the district courts as appeals continue on the “important constitutional questions” raised by birthright citizenship.<br>The Administration argues that the Constitution does not give judges the power to issue universal injunctions and that courts are limited to addressing the cases before them in a given district. The Administration acknowledges that class actions can create the basis for universal injunctions, offering a moderate resolution to the Court. In such cases, if the parties can meet the standard for a national class, they can seek a national or universal injunction.<br>In today’s arguments (which I will be covering for Fox and on X), we can expect to hear from justices who have previously been critical of universal injunctions, including Justice Clarence Thomas, who, in his concurring opinion in Trump v. Hawaii, called them “legally and historically dubious.”<br>Likewise, Justices Gorsuch and Alito have criticized such injunctions. In a prior dissent to an emergency filing in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, Alito was joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh in stating that the government “has a strong argument that the District Court’s order violates the principle that a federal court may not issue an equitable remedy that is ‘more burdensome than necessary to’ redress the plaintiff’s injuries.”<br>Many of us will be watching three members the most closely: Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett. Roberts is the ultimate institutionalist, and we should see in his argument how he views the impact of such injunctions on the court system as a whole. He is very protective of the courts’ inherent authority but may also have misgivings about the scope of these orders.<br>During the Biden Administration, Justice Kagan has previously criticized universal injunctions. In an interview at Northwestern University Law School, Kagan flagged the “forum shopping” by litigants in filing cases before favorable courts:<br>“You look at something like that and you think, that can’t be right. In the Trump years, people used to go to the Northern District of California, and in the Biden years, they go to Texas. It just can’t be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through the normal process.”<br>Justice Barrett previously joined with Kavanaugh in stating that the power of district courts to enter a universal injunction “is an important question that could warrant our review in the future.”<br>The argument today will start at 10 am and I will be doing a running review of the arguments on X.<br>U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer will argue the government’s case.<br>Jeremy Feigenbaum, New Jersey’s solicitor general, will argue for the state and local governments and  Kelsi Corkran, the Supreme Court director at Georgetown’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, will argue for the private individuals and groups.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R273" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">274</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:1933px;left:-1px">OVER MY SHOULDER by MAULDIN ECONOMICS<br>Hôm nay, tiết mục Over My Shoulder của Mauldin Economics lại đề cập tới thị trường trái phiếu (là giấy nợ, bonds) của giới đầu tư: Họ cho vay tiền để hưởng tiền lời, gọi là phân lời hay yield, cao thấp là tùy kỳ hạn dài hay ngắn và tùy các rủi ro nhiều hay ít. <br>Sau khi Patrick Watson tóm lược (và lưu ý rằng cổ phiếu lên giá mà “thị trường trái phiếu không tin”) là thẩm định của Brusuelas với đồ biểu đưa lên hình cho dễ đọc: đường tuyến màu đen là chỉ số cổ phiếu S&amp;P 500, màu lục là phân lời Công khố phiếu 10 năm<br>By Patrick Watson | May 15, 2025<br>Joseph Brusuelas: The Bond Market Isn&#39;t Buying It<br>Why You Should Read: RSM economist Joseph Brusuelas flags an important market divergence: Stocks are recovering while Treasury bond yields have resumed rising.

Đồ biểu ở cuối bài]<br>THE BOND MARKET IS NOT BUYING IT<br>(By Joseph Brusuelas - May 15, 2025) <br>The recovery in equity valuations over the past month has been impressive. Driven by the United States’ pulling back from a multifront trade war, the S&amp;P 500 index is essentially flat for the year as of May 14 after a 15.28% plunge through April 8. <br>But the bond market is seeing something different. <br>Instead of yields falling as equity valuations have recovered, the fixed income market has focused on the shaky and incoherent foundation of the trade conflict, the unimpressive revenues earned from trade taxes and the growing probability that tax legislation will feature a large tax cut funded by government debt. <br>Given the risks to the economy - a recession is still a coin flip this year - and recovery in the equity markets, bond yields should be falling. <br>They are not, and that is because fixed-income investors are sniffing out the logic of economic populism amid a move toward trade protectionism, which strongly implies higher inflation and rising long-term yields. <br>Of course, that results in additional compensation demanded by investors for holding U.S. Treasury securities under such conditions which is also known as the risk premium. And the increase in yields is exactly what has happened over the first two weeks of May. <br>Should Congress approve a large tax cut that is not paid for, don’t be surprised if the bond market pushes yields back toward mid-April highs, which captured the pushback against the trade conflict. <br>With the U.S. 10-year yield trading late Wednesday at 4.54% - the high this year is 4.792% - and the 30-year at 4.97%, nearly at this year’s high of 4.974%, remember that any move above 5% at the long end of the curve will result in nothing but trouble and likely bring to an end the recent relief rally in equities. <br>If investors are looking for a reason to sell in May and go away, it would appear that the bond market might be providing an important forward-looking signal given the plans of the fiscal authority, trade and tax policy.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R274" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">275</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3533px;left:-1px">HỢP TÁC VỀ ‘AI’ TẠI TRUNG ĐÔNG LẠI CÓ LỢI CHO TRUNG QUỐC?<br>Ban tham mưu của Trump thiếu thống nhất về chương trình hợp tác về Trí Tuệ Nhân Tạo AI với các nước Trung Đông vì có thể đem lại lợi thế cho Trung Cộng.

Such chips are used to develop and train models that can mimic human intelligence, and they’re the most coveted technology of the AI age.<br>Some senior administration officials are seeking to slow down the deals over concerns the US hasn’t imposed sufficient guardrails to prevent American chips shipped to the Gulf from ultimately benefiting China, which has deep ties in the region, according to people familiar with the matter. While the UAE and Saudi accords include high-level language barring Chinese firms from accessing those chips, these officials argue too many details are still unresolved and the deals shouldn’t be announced without legally binding provisions, the people said.<br>China hawks also have grown alarmed over what they see as a willingness by White House AI Adviser David Sacks, who’s helping lead the talks, to entertain proposals from Gulf leaders that they view as clear national security risks. None of those proposals are included in the current bilateral accords in the Middle East.<br>Beyond those security issues, some senior Trump officials question the wisdom of shipping such large quantities of chips to any location outside the US, given the administration’s focus on maintaining American dominance in AI, said the people. As Vice President JD Vance put it at a Paris AI summit in February, “the Trump administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American designed and manufactured chips.”<br>If the announced and planned Middle East deals all come to fruition, the US would still hold the vast majority of the world’s computing power - but Gulf countries would for the first time have significant capabilities powered by best-in-class US hardware.<br>A representative for the White House didn’t provide official comment for this story, which is based on interviews with nearly a dozen people who spoke about internal administration discussions on condition of anonymity. Nvidia and a spokesperson for the UAE declined to comment, while Sacks, AMD and the Saudi Arabian government didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br>US President Donald Trump, left, and David Sacks, White House AI and crypto czar. Photographer: Samuel Corum/Sipa/Bloomberg<br>Advocates for the deals, including Sacks, argue that if the US doesn’t encourage the world to use American chips, countries with AI ambitions will eventually turn to alternatives from Chinese companies - which have made progress in closing the gap with Nvidia, the industry leader.<br>“We need our friends, like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other strategic partners and allies, to want to build on our tech,” Sacks said Tuesday while on stage with Saudi Arabia’s minister of communications and information technology. The possibility of that tech winding up in China is “not an issue with a friend like Saudi Arabia at all,” he said.<br>Not everyone in the Trump administration agrees. In escalating conversations over the past two days, several senior officials have discussed strategies for slowing the implementation of Gulf AI agreements - and pumping the brakes on projects that have yet to be unveiled, the people said. One concern is a bilateral accord between the US and UAE that could include a massive project by OpenAI, the industry pioneer behind ChatGPT.<br>Trump arrived in Abu Dhabi on Thursday after stops earlier this week in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Officials on the ground were still in active negotiations the morning of the president’s visit, according to people familiar with the matter, who added that they expect the deals to move forward in the near term.<br>If that happens, China hawks may press their concerns through the regulatory process in Washington. All AI chip shipments to the Gulf require US government approval through a licensing process involving several federal agencies. Administration officials are also in the middle of drafting global semiconductor export control rules after tossing out a framework introduced by President Joe Biden. That provides another opportunity to include specific China guardrails and other strategic priorities.<br>Sacks, along with other officials who support the Gulf projects, has made the case that aggressive proliferation with security provisions would be a strategic win for the US - and crucial for maintaining American leadership in AI.<br>Part of Sacks’ argument - echoed by tech leaders including Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang - is that the US lead over China in advanced chipmaking is shrinking. If Washington prevents countries with AI ambitions from building data centers with American technology, the logic goes, the US risks ceding those markets to its main geopolitical rival. Companies may choose to buy chips from the likes of Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese tech giant at the center of Washington’s efforts to curtail Beijing’s AI ambitions.<br>On the other side of the debate, some officials in both the Trump and Biden administrations have argued that America’s technological lead is quite large and enables Washington to write the rules of the road for as long as other countries still covet American chips. Policymakers can afford to be aggressive in negotiations, these officials argue, and shouldn’t allow countries to access best-in-class American hardware without concessions and ironclad security promises.<br>Trump officials in this second camp think they may be losing the internal fight over Middle East chip shipments - especially after the UAE and Saudi Arabia offered a combined $2.4 trillion in US investments that helped pave the way for the recent AI deals. In particular, some senior administration officials have grown wary of negotiating positions adopted by Sacks, who has been one of the central players on the ground as government officials and tech executives hammer out the accords.<br>In one meeting with Emirati officials ahead of Trump’s trip, Sacks expressed openness to the UAE housing a production facility from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the leading maker of chips for the likes of Nvidia and AMD, people familiar with the matter said. The UAE has long coveted such a plant and asked the US government for its support as part of the broader chip accord.<br>The hawkish Trump officials view a possible TSMC plant in the UAE as dangerous, the people said. Supporting the UAE’s ambitions to manufacture AI chips domestically would create unnecessary national security risks given the country’s ties to Beijing, the officials argue, especially if political alliances change in the future. The current accord doesn’t include a TSMC plant, though separate conversations about such a project remain ongoing. TSMC declined to comment.<br>Another lingering concern with the UAE is G42, the leading Abu Dhabi-based AI firm with historic ties to Huawei. Although it agreed to divest from Huawei and other Chinese providers to pave the way for a $1.5 billion partnership with Microsoft Corp. last year, some US officials remain wary of G42’s commitment to American priorities. Now the Trump administration is considering an agreement that would allow G42 to buy the equivalent of more than a million Nvidia H100 accelerators, among the chipmaker’s top offerings, Bloomberg has reported.<br>Critics of that accord include the chairman of the House China Select Committee, which last year released a video detailing the bipartisan panel’s G42 concerns. The voiceover in that video comes from Landon Heid, Trump’s nominee for a top position at the agency that writes chip export rules and decides whether to approve individual semiconductor sales.<br>Details of the security requirements in the broader UAE accord will be sorted out in a working group composed of American and Emirati officials, according to the people familiar with the matter. Topics already in the agreement include provisions to prevent diversion of chips to China and bar Chinese AI companies from remotely accessing UAE facilities. Sacks has been angling to steer efforts to write the fine print, the people said - something that several of his US counterparts oppose.<br>At one point in negotiations with Saudi Arabia, Saudi officials suggested they may install US chips in facilities that contain Huawei hardware, the people said, adding that the hardware in question was not Huawei’s AI chips. The US delegation shot down that suggestion in the meeting, but after the fact, Sacks suggested that Trump’s team should at least evaluate the idea. While some officials understood Sacks’ reaction as a suggestion to consider national security concerns on a technical basis, others saw it as an immediate disregard for why US officials would hold those concerns in the first place.<br>For officials who view Huawei as a red line in Washington’s China policy, the exploration of that possibility was unacceptable. The idea is not part of the current accord, people familiar with the matter said.<br>“The policy objective of preventing diversion to countries of concern is an absolutely important objective of the United States but it is not a difficult one to achieve,” Sacks said during his Middle East appearance. “The truth of the matter is that all one would have to do is send someone to a data center and count the server racks to make sure the chips are still there.”</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R275" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">276</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:1833px;left:-1px">QUỐC HỘI MỸ MẤT DẦN SỰ TÍN NHIỆM CỦA CỬ TRI<br>Sau khi đọc bài nhắc nhở vừa yết của Freddy Gray trên The Spectator, xin hãy đọc tin của Sharyl Attkisson như một lời khuyên nhủ khác:<br>Tổ chức khảo sát dân ý (rất có uy tín) Rasmussen vừa công bố kết quả thăm dò ý kiến của cử tri Hoa Kỳ về Quốc Hội.

I know I did. The line was too tempting. As Trump stormed back into the White House, his power looked irresistible. His enemies seemed so broken and defeated.<br>We all spoke too soon. “Never Trumpism” is a reaction to Trumpism, as natural as magnetic repulsion and the urge to defy and destroy his presidency hasn’t vanished. In fact, look closely and you can see a “Resistance 2.0” gathering momentum in response to the second Trump administration.<br>The arguments for the next impeachment of Donald Trump are being tested ahead of the 2027 midterms and they will center, once again, on the possible corruption of the Trump family and its associates through vast sums of Middle Eastern cash. Trump is going to Abu Dhabi today and he seems cock-a-hoop at all the trillions of dollars in Arab investment deals that are coming his way. “I want to thank the media,” he said yesterday, magnanimously, at a meeting in Qatar. “The media, I have to say, has been very fair. They’re having a hard time saying bad because this is a record tour that will raise… it could be a total of $3.5-4 trillion.” Everybody loves big numbers.<br>But Trump is deluding himself if he can’t see the negative publicity spinning out of his golden grand tour of the Levant. There’s the Qatar Force One story – the news that Trump has accepted a $400 million luxury jet as a gift from the government in Doha. The aircraft is meant to replace the aging Air Force One aircraft and Trump professed himself incredulous as to the outrage over the present. “Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,” he said.<br>But the Israel hawks surrounding Trump are displeased with his new friendship with the Qataris, who are, according to the official line from Tel Aviv, state sponsors of terrorism, the evil Robin to the badman Batman that is Iran. If Trump continues to fall out with Benjamin Netanyahu – and dares to strike some kind of nuclear deal with Tehran – the jet gift story will be pushed as evidence of a sinister “quid pro quo” with the Muslim Brotherhood. Remember it was allegations of a “quid pro quo” offer to Volodymyr Zelensky that caused Trump’s first impeachment in 2019.<br>But the jet story will be just one arrow in the Resistance 2.0’s quiver. The bigger looming scandal is World Liberty Financial (WLF), the crypto business which the Trump sons launched at Mar-a-Lago last September. It hasn’t gone unnoticed that, this month, an Abu Dhabi investment firm used a WLF “stablecoin” to invest $2 billion in Binance, the online crypto platform. WLF’s co-founder is Zach Witkoff, son of Steve, Trump’s Middle East envoy, and the whole enterprise has more than a whiff of Hunter Bidenish depravity about it. Crypto is still the wild west of the digital future and riddled with nefarious operators, some alarmingly close to the First Family. And the WLF story is already being connected to the $Trump coin scandal – the obviously bogus crypto currency that the president helped launch in the week of his inauguration. A number of Trump associates made a lot of very fast money out of that.<br>Democrats claim to be shocked by the sheer brazenness of the Trump family’s double-dealing. “It’s hard not to be simultaneously terrified at the thought of the damage he can cause with such power and awed by his willingness to brazenly shatter so many harmful taboos,” Rob Malley [thực tế là kẻ làm công cho Iran!], who helped broker Barack Obama’s deal with Iran in 2015, tells Axios. But without a congressional majority, Trump’s opponents remain impotent.<br>The question then turns towards the mid-terms: if Trump loses his slender advantage in the House of Representatives, as he did in 2018, the Democrats will make White House “kleptocracy” their number-one issue and move to impeach him once more. That is unlikely to remove him from office, as the Democrats surely won’t have a sufficiently large Senate vote to terminate the presidency. Still, as Trump continues his pharaonic world diplomacy, the corruption stories are piling up against him. And if most Americans don’t start feeling richer as a result of these petro-trillions flooding into the tech-dominated American economy, the stench will start to overpower.<br>The above is taken from Freddy Gray’s weekly Americano newsletter.

CASA, which challenges lower court rulings that blocked President Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants.<br>Despite the constitutional authority granted to the executive branch on immigration matters, three district judges issued sweeping nationwide injunctions halting the order. Now, the highest court may have the chance to rein in judicial overreach and restore balance between the branches of government.<br>Since President Trump began his second term, liberal judges have weaponized nationwide injunctions against his administration an astonishing 17 times in just the first few months - and that’s only counting through late March 2025. This is nothing new, of course.<br>Even Newsweek seems to believe that the court will side with the Trump administration.<br>In recent years, some justices have expressed criticism of universal injunctions.<br>Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of the court’s conservatives, argued in a 2020 concurring opinion that injunctions are “meant to redress the injuries sustained by a particular plaintiff in a particular lawsuit.”<br>He said the “routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these conflicting decisions” and that the court must address them.<br>He also noted that nationwide injunctions mean that plaintiffs can shop around for the judge that is most likely to be sympathetic to their cause.<br>“Because plaintiffs generally are not bound by adverse decisions in cases to which they were not a party, there is a nearly boundless opportunity to shop for a friendly forum to secure a win nationwide,” Gorsuch wrote.<br>Even Justice Elena Kagan, one of the Court’s three liberal justices, has criticized broad nationwide injunctions and the blatant judge-shopping tactics used by plaintiffs to game the system.<br>This shouldn’t be a partisan issue because Joe Biden’s outgoing Solicitor General, Elizabeth Prelogar, also filed a brief in December 2024 asking the Supreme Court to limit these broad orders despite knowing Trump would benefit from the decision.<br>“In the Trump years, people used to go to the Northern District of California, and in the Biden years, they go to Texas,” Kagan said in 2022. “It just can’t be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through the normal process.”<br>Let’s be honest: Nationwide injunctions were never about judicial oversight. They’ve been the left’s go-to tool for blocking President Trump’s agenda through activist judges. With just one ruling, any of the hundreds of district court judges in the country can nullify federal policy they don’t like.<br>Now, the left is panicking. Without these judicial shortcuts, they’ll have to argue their cases on the merits instead of in front of cherry-picked friendly judges. Even Vox admitted these injunctions were “the core of the resistance.”<br>But that era may be ending. The Supreme Court looks poised to rein in this abuse of power and restore constitutional balance. For anyone who believes in law, not lawfare, this moment can’t come soon enough.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R279" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">280</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2933px;left:-1px">ĐẺ CON Ở ĐÂU, NÓ LÀ CÔNG DÂN Ở ĐÓ?<br>Sau Nội Chiến, một sơ xuất về cách diễn giải Tu Chính Án 14 đã gây nhiều vấn đề và nhất là lạm dụng về quyền là công dân ở nơi sinh đẻ (birthright).

Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press<br>Two huge debates collide at the Supreme Court on Thursday, and which direction the arguments will ricochet is hard to predict. First question: Can President Trump deny citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens? Second: Can a solitary federal judge in any outpost of this vast nation halt government action from sea to shining sea?<br>On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to reinterpret the 14th Amendment. He wants to exclude from “birthright citizenship” babies born in the U.S. to parents here illegally or temporarily, including on student or tourist visas. Three judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington issued “universal” injunctions to block that policy nationwide.<br>The Justice Department filed an emergency appeal to the High Court, seeking what it framed as “modest” relief. Complaining about the universal injunctions, it asked the Justices to whittle down the lower court rulings so they protect only the specific parties in the lawsuits. The Justices took the unusual step of setting emergency oral argument and could soon rule on citizenship, injunctions, or both.<br>***<br>The first question is straightforward. The 14th Amendment was ratified after the Civil War and the wretched decision in Dred Scott (1857), which said black former slaves and their descendants were excluded from U.S. citizenship. The amendment begins: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.” The dispute is whether illegal aliens are subject to U.S. jurisdiction.<br>The longtime interpretation suggests yes. In Wong Kim Ark (1898) the Supreme Court held that a man born in San Francisco to alien parents was a citizen. The majority held that the 14th Amendment affirmed “the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory,” including for “all children here born of resident aliens.” Exceptions included children born to foreign diplomats or to enemies in “a hostile occupation.”<br>This fits a plain reading of the amendment’s text. Foreign diplomats have legal immunity, a small example being their refusal to pay New York parking tickets. If some belligerent army were to seize part of the U.S., its troops obviously wouldn’t be “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” Illegal immigrants, by contrast, are both subject to federal law and routinely prosecuted and imprisoned for violating it.<br>Proponents of Mr. Trump’s theory argue that Wong Kim Ark’s parents weren’t living in the country illegally, meaning birthright citizenship for the children of transient border-crossers is an open question. Yet it takes hard work to read into the meaning of the 14th Amendment a distinction that seems not to be written there.<br>Mr. Trump has a better argument when he says federal judges are too quick to issue nationwide rulings. The Constitution empowers the judiciary to decide “cases” and “controversies,” which generally means relief for the parties at hand. As disputes percolate through the appeals courts, the judicial circuits might diverge. When a legal split gets serious, the High Court accepts a case to put things back on the level. That’s the theory, anyway.<br>What happens in practice, at least lately, is that the political faction out of power challenges the government’s every move in a friendly legal venue. “District courts issued 14 universal injunctions against the federal government through the first three years of President Biden’s term,” the Justice Department says in its emergency filing. “By contrast, courts issued 15 universal injunctions (or temporary restraining orders) against the current Administration in February 2025 alone.”<br>This rise in sweeping judicial orders hasn’t come out of nowhere. It’s happening in tandem with broad new assertions of executive power. Consider the halting of President Obama’s “deferred action” for illegal parents of citizen children. “We had 26 state plaintiffs,” former Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller said in 2019, defending that injunction. “The very nature of our challenge was that the federal government could not say that certain individuals were lawfully present in the country.”<br>President Biden’s effort to forgive $430 billion of student debt was frozen in a case involving Missouri’s loan servicer, Mohela. The Eighth Circuit considered a narrower injunction but saw “no workable path” to disentangle who’d be covered. If Mr. Biden had the leeway, he might have quickly wiped out everybody else’s debt, maybe while buying time by telling his Justice Department to dawdle in appealing his Eighth Circuit loss.<br>The worry about completely ruling out universal injunctions is whether that would enable abuses of executive power. There is plenty for the Justices to chew on here. But as a first bite, they at least could tell lower-court judges to think harder about the relief any given case demands, while reserving extraordinary injunctions for extraordinary situations.<br>Copyright ©2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

No way am I filling a 14-gallon tank with a week’s worth of Erewhon smoothie money. Absurd. And California Governor-slash-podcast bro Gavin Newsom knows it. Despite calling the fossil fuel industry the “polluted heart of this climate crisis” a mere year ago, he’s ordering officials to work with oil refiners to “ensure that Californians continue to have access to a safe, affordable and reliable supply of transportation fuels.”<br>At first, it looks like a classic political flip-flop in line with Newsom going after homeless camps and yanking health care from undocumented immigrants. Which, yes, Erika D. Smith and Liam Denning say it is - after all, the guy’s eyeing a presidential run in 2028. But, as they write, “it’s also evidence of rising tension between the state’s net-zero objectives and the economic woes of working-class Californians.”<br>For those unfamiliar with the Golden State’s squeeze on fuel prices, let me catch you up: Two refineries - one in the Bay Area and the other near Long Beach - are on the verge of closing. “The state is losing fuel production faster than it is losing its appetite for gasoline,” Erika and Liam explain.<br>The West Coast Premium<br>California&#39;s drivers pay about $1.30 extra per gallon of gasoline, or roughly 40% more, compared to the US average<br>Source: Energy Information Administration<br>Plenty of privileged Californians will look at that chart and wonder why gasoline prices even matter when the Trump administration is taking a chainsaw to the Constitution. But Latino communities - “the gardeners, nannies and construction workers who drive 100 miles roundtrip each weekday” - are scraping by, hence why they supported the candidate who promised to lower prices in 2024: “Trump’s vote share increased in all 12 of California’s Latino-majority counties.

It’s not as if Prius-driving, paper straw-drinking, tote bag-carrying Californians are going to become climate change deniers overnight. Wildfires, droughts and floods have already shown up on their doorsteps; they know climate change threatens their future. But that doesn’t change the fact that it’s a painful process that comes with financial hardships.<br>“It might take $192 trillion in global investment in clean energy and efficiency by 2050 to zero out the planet’s emissions and limit global warming to barely manageable levels,” writes Mark Gongloff.

Costs for fossil-fuel processes and power, conventional industry and internal-combustion engine vehicles not included.<br>As Mark says, it’s important not to think of clean energy spending as a one-and-done thing: “This isn’t buying a $2,000 cardigan at Saks,” he writes. “It’s buying a heat pump that trims your power bill by hundreds of dollars a year while also cutting the greenhouse-gas emissions heating up the planet and endangering your health, safety and personal finances.”<br>Gas pump pain is temporary! Heat pumps are forever.<br>Maximum Uncertainty<br>You really can’t make this stuff up: HBO went from HBO → HBO Max → Max back to HBO Max in, what, five years? They’re trolling us!! But maybe that’s the whole point:<br>What’s funny is that this feels like something President Donald Trump would do if he was a streaming executive! “Free outraged publicity” is his bread and butter. Think about the language we use to discuss the trade war: “Tariff whiplash.” “On-again, off-again.” “Escalate to deescalate.” All that uncertainty is part of Trump’s quest to stay relevant. He does that by being unpredictable. HBO is just trying to do the same thing.<br>But tariffs aren’t a branding exercise. They carry real-world consequences for the economy. The fact that nobody knows what’ll happen after the 90-day trade reprieve - which officially starts today, May 14 - between China and the US is not good. Bill Dudley says the pause “will lead businesses to delay purchase, investment and hiring decisions.” The “corrosive uncertainty” - his words, not mine - wrought upon by these tariffs gives the Fed little wiggle room, he argues: “When it doesn’t know which way the risks skew, it must wait for more information.”<br>You know what’s not waiting for more information, though? The stock market: “The S&amp;P 500, as of now, is showing a gain for 2025. It needs another 4.3% rise to set a record high. The basics of a 15% fall from the start of the year, then recouped in full, haven’t been achieved this swiftly since 1982,” writes John Authers.<br>Back in the Black for 2025<br>The S&amp;P hasn&#39;t rebounded like this since 1982 - start of a great bull market<br>Source: Bloomberg<br>Note: Re-based: 100 = Index level on Dec. 31 of preceding year<br>For the retail investors who didn’t panic and bought the dip, Marc Rubinstein says the market delivered “a gain of about 17% from the lows.” Bloomberg’s editorial board members are skeptical as to whether the happy-go-lucky vibes can be sustained, though: “If the promised talks should stall and tariffs are pushed back up, the mood is bound to reverse,” theywrite (free read).<br>It’s certainly reversed in Europe, thanks to Trump saying the EU is “nastier than China” (there’s that free outraged publicity again!). Paris-based columnist Lionel Laurent, who recently popped by our New York Bureau, says his trip made him “acutely aware of how the European continent is an object receding in the geoeconomic rear-view mirror.” Hmmm.

Andrew Harnik/Getty Images<br>A.R. HOFFMAN<br>(By A.R. HOFFMAN - NY Sun - Published: May. 14, 2025 04:33 PM ET - Updated: May. 14, 2025 05:04 PM ET)<br>The declaration from the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, that President Trump is contemplating suspending habeas corpus puts the adviser - who does not have a law degree - at the van of the 47th president’s legal agenda.<br>Mr. Miller’s primacy within Mr. Trump’s camarilla comes through in a profile of Attorney General Bondi that appeared this week in the Times. The Gray Lady reports that the administration’s agenda for the Department of Justice “has largely been set by Mr. Trump, his adviser Stephen Miller and other officials,” and that “it was clear from the start that Mr. Miller, who is not a lawyer, would exercise control” inside the DOJ. <br>The DOJ’s former top pardon lawyer, Elizabeth Oyer, who was fired by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and has been vocal about her unhappiness with the new administration, told the Times with respect of Ms. Bondi: “It feels like she is just performing a part. She is like an actor, in a way.” Ms. Oyer reflected that “the decisions are being made at the White House, and then they’re being pushed down to the Department of Justice, which is very, very atypical.”  <br>The influential Mr. Miller, who also serves as Mr. Trump’s homeland security advisor, shared with reporters that the suspension of the Great Writ was “an option we’re actively looking at.” Such a move appears to be motivated by a desire to advance Mr. Trump’s deportations efforts, which have been hampered by some district court judges who believe that illegal aliens should be able to access habeas.<br>The Constitution ordains: “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” The Suspension Clause, though, appears in Article I of the parchment, which established the Congress and suggests the Framers reckoned that the clause was a limitation on Congress - not a prerogative of the presidency. <br>Mr. Miller, the son of a successful California real estate lawyer, may not have a law degree, but he has demonstrated great facility at using the law to advance his objectives. In 2021 he founded a group, America First Legal, that successfully sued the government and other powerful organizations for illegal discrimination. In one major victory, he managed to thwart President Biden’s efforts to give $5 billion in reparations to Black farmers. <br>Immigration has long been Mr. Miller’s favorite assignment - he is a hardliner - and he ran policy on that front during Mr. Trump’s first term. He was a primary author of the travel ban that was, after several iterations, upheld - in a 5-to-4 ruling - by the Supreme Court as constitutional  in the case of Trump v. Hawaii. Mr. Miller also supports ending birthright citizenship. The Nine will hear that issue on Thursday.<br>The justices will also consider curtailing the issuing by federal judges of nationwide or universal injunctions. Mr. Miller has made the power of district judges to block Mr. Trump’s agenda a focal point. In March he declared that “our objective, one way or another, is to make clear that the district courts of this country do not have the authority to direct the functions of the executive branch.” <br>That position, which will be argued before the Nine by Solicitor General John Sauer, could prosper. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas have both expressed skepticism toward universal injunctions, and in 2022 Justice Elena Kagan reflected that “it just can’t be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through the normal process.”<br>If Mr. Miller is coordinating closely with the DOJ, that would appear to align with Mr. Trump’s desire to more tightly control the department that, under Attorney General Garland and Special Counsel Jack Smith, launched two criminal cases against him. During his first term, Mr. Trump was frustrated when his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from the Russia probe and appointed a special counsel. Even Mr. Session’s more accommodating replacement, William Barr, eventually quit under pressure after the 2020 election.<br>Ms. Bondi, who unlike Messrs. Barr and Garland did not go to an Ivy League college, is a former elected attorney general and, like Secretary Rubio, is a Floridian. She appears to be in lockstep with Mr. Trump and his West Wing advisers. When Ms. Bondi was sworn in she announced a “new DOJ” and vowed to make Mr. Trump “proud.”<br>Last month, America First Legal, the group Mr. Miller founded, filed a complaint against Attorney General Letitia James with the New York State Unified Court System’s Committee on Professional Standards. The complaint requests a state probe into allegations that Ms. James committed acts of mortgage fraud.<br>Ms. James is under criminal investigation by the justice department over the mortgage matter. Her broader conduct as an attorney general is also on the radar of Ms. Bondi’s Weaponization Working Group, which vows to probe “Federal cooperation with the weaponization by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, New York Attorney General Letitia James, their respective staffs, and other New York officials to target President Trump, his family, and his businesses.” <br>The new director of that group is Ed Martin, whose nomination for United States attorney for the District of Columbia the president recently withdrew. Mr. Martin is also taking over Ms. Oyer’s pardon duties.<br>A former DOJ official, Ed Whelan, a conservative, tells the Times, “I can’t recall an attorney general who seemed willing to be subordinate to White House staffers.” The office of the attorney general was created in 1789, and the DOJ dates to 1870. The Constitution vests all of the “executive power” in the president, meaning that he bears ultimate responsibility for the DOJ.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R284" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">285</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/14/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:5635px;left:-1px">TIẾT MỤC DIVIDEND CAFÉ CỦA THE BAHNSEN GROUP<br>Tóm tắt cho giới đầu tư, và câu hỏi đáp do Brian Szytel phụ trách:<br>----<br>Daily Recap - May 14, 2025<br>Dow: -89 (-0.21%)<br>S&amp;P: +0.10%<br>Nasdaq: +0.72%<br>2-Year Treasury Yield: 4.06% (+4 basis points)<br>10-Year Treasury Yield: 4.54% (+4 basis points)<br>Top-performing sector: Communication Services (+1.58%)<br>Bottom-performing sector: Health Care (-2.31%)<br>WTI Crude Oil: $62.85/barrel (-1.29%)<br>       * Fed Governor Waller said he would support more rate cuts and sooner if there were adverse effects on employment related to tariffs.<br>What&#39;s On Brian&#39;s Mind<br>A quiet day in markets to go along with a quiet day in the economic calendar.  That said, the S&amp;P closed modestly higher, the third day in a row, and is now up 18% from the low on 4/8/25, and slightly positive on the year.  A big rally in credit spreads in this recovery, the past few weeks, as well as high yield spreads coming sharply back to near record lows of just 300bps over Treasuries. <br>This market recovery in this short period has been one to behold.<br>Lately, there has been some resumption of animal spirits in AI-related names with reiterated CAPEX plans in the sector, and Trump’s visit to the Middle East to open advanced chip sales in the region.  The shift from the previous administration’s approach to offering advanced chips abroad based on qualitative factors to one that is country-specific and includes reciprocal investment back in the US is part of what has been driving the sector.  This has led to both the continued expansion in data center CAPEX and the need for power generation, fueling demand in the utility sector. <br>M&amp;A in the sector has also picked up with total deals this year alone already exceeding all last year combined.  The question isn’t going to be whether certain sectors can potentially benefit in this reciprocal trade environment (i.e., LNG exports) or certain sectors see potential policy headwinds (pharma), it&#39;s going to be whether the net effect adds to GDP and reduces deficits in the process.<br>For a fresh pulse on that end, tomorrow is one of the most action-packed economic data days I can remember.  We have the Empire and Philly Fed manufacturing, retail sales, PPI, initial jobless claims, industrial production, and potentially even a meeting between Putin and Zelensky to top it all off.  I’ll leave it here for the day, knowing there is plenty to unpack here tomorrow.<br>Ask TBG<br>  “I don’t own any Bitcoin, but now, with an exchange-traded fund available, do you think it makes sense for some percentage of a moderate investor&#39;s net worth from an asset allocation standpoint, say 2-5%?  The idea would be to diversify and add a safe haven asset and to hedge the risk of the US Dollar falling out of favor globally and fiat currency in general.  Thoughts?”~ D. R.<br>  I could elaborate a whole lot more on this subject, but here are a few main points I would make counter to what you would be after. <br>First, due to the hyper-volatile nature of Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies, the percentage of net worth most could tolerate would be just as you say, something in that sub-5% range. I am well aware of the super fans in the space swearing it should be much higher, and that is fine, I am just telling you pragmatically and from experience that most are not comfortable putting more than that amount of their nest egg in something that goes up and down more than 50% every few years to begin with.  <br>  That begs the question, even if it were to hedge against the demise of the dollar or fiat currency (which is debatable), how much would 5% do to offset the ill-fated outcome that would come of the other 95%?  Second, its historical record would be counter to it consistently performing like a safe haven asset to provide such a hedge to begin with.  When it declines as much or more during pure risk-off periods (March 2020, 2022, Q1 2025 and others), it defeats that purpose.  I understand the limited supply and decentralized use case for it.  I also understand the argument intellectually for a small percentage simply for the unknown correlation or diversification it may (or may not) provide.  I am just saying pragmatically, the volatility and correlation with other risk assets make it unrealistic as a safe haven.  If you want some skin in the game because it’s exciting and fascinating otherwise, then fine (so long as it’s in that small range of exposure).~ Brian T.

Somalis are flown in from 8,000 miles away - then they vacation in Somalia, you know, where they were allegedly being persecuted.<br>Trump could have accomplished the same thing - saving white South Africans from probable genocide - by offering refugee status only to immigrants who are unlikely ever to need government assistance. As luck would have it, that&#39;s already the law (8 USC 1182 (a)(4)(A)).<br>Or only to those who&#39;ve been fully vaccinated against mumps, measles, polio, etc., and, in light of the typical refugee, also against cholera, malaria, leprosy, yellow fever, typhoid fever, Ebola and other medieval diseases. <br>That, too, is already the law (8 USC 1182 (a)(1)(A)(ii)).<br>Or to no one who is a witch doctor, Santeria priest or voodoo practitioner. <br>(Again, already the law: 8 USC 1182 (a)(5)(B).)<br>These and many other provisions of federal immigration law have been entirely ignored for the past 50 years in order to bring in the poorest of the poor, who have no concept of Western civilization, preferably with wildly expensive medical problems and no means of support apart from criminal activity, who will require taxpayer support for the rest of their lives. <br>But their selling point is, they&#39;re not white.<br>The other night, CNN&#39;s Anderson Cooper and The New York Times&#39; Nicholas Kristof were in high dudgeon over Trump admitting English-speaking, non-welfare-receiving, Dutch-descended South Africans who are currently being threatened with dispossession and death by officials in their own government. <br>(The Economic Freedom Fighters - Motto: &quot;Kill the Boer!&quot; - with 10% to 15% of the vote, are insistent that land and businesses be confiscated from white owners and redistributed to Black South Africans. The New York Times reports that &quot;a large segment&quot; of the governing African National Congress agrees.) <br>First, let&#39;s review Kristof&#39;s expertise on refugees. He spent a decade promoting a total fraud, Somaly Mam, who claimed she&#39;d been beaten and prostituted as a child in Cambodia, sold to a brothel and tortured with electrodes. She wasn&#39;t white, so Mam became an instant celebrity, feted by Time magazine, Hillary Clinton, Sheryl Sandberg, Meg Ryan and Oprah.<br>Then it turned out her whole story was an elaborate Nigerian Prince scam, completely apocryphal from beginning to end, as was finally exposed by Newsweek magazine. So we should definitely listen to Kristof when it comes to humanitarian cases. <br>Anderson and Kristof&#39;s main argument is that there are millions of non-whites out there! Why can&#39;t we get them instead of being saddled with 59 tall, healthy, educated, English-speaking South Africans? It&#39;s hard to argue with that.<br>On the other hand, their beloved Afghans, who &quot;saved the lives of American troops,&quot; according to both Cooper and Kristof (Cooper heard it from Jussie Smollett, and Kristof heard it from Somaly Mam), prefer to live under sharia law.<br>In case you&#39;re unfamiliar with the Taliban, their version of sharia prohibits women from leaving their homes without a male relative, forces them to wear head-to-toe burqas, and still employs stonings, public hangings and amputations as criminal punishments. <br>To each his own, but wouldn&#39;t the 99% of Afghans who told Pew they want to live that way be happier in one of the 35 countries that practice sharia law? <br>Cooper was especially incensed that we&#39;re not bringing Sudanese and Congolese people to our shores, testily adding, &quot;On this program, we reported on the violence, the plight of people there in a series of programs in 2006.&quot; (Don&#39;t worry if you missed it, nothing&#39;s changed.) <br>Those countries have been beset by bloody civil wars, involving mass rape and millions dead. WHY CAN&#39;T WE HAVE THAT IN OUR COUNTRY??? Not only that, but Congo has been &quot;fighting for decades.&quot; What&#39;s not to like?<br>Cooper seems to think Congolese people merely need to be moved to a majority white country, like the U.S., in order to bring stability and safety to their lives. It&#39;s like busing on an international scale. <br>Unfortunately, the idea of the Great White Father died out with European colonialism. If the mightiest empires in the world could spend decades imposing Western values, the rule of law, modern medicine, engineering and farming techniques on these countries only to have them - immediately, the moment the imperial power leaves - erupt into bloody, violent, corrupt, cannibalistic dystopias, then bringing them here to collect welfare probably isn&#39;t going to help either.<br>By 1968, British historian Paul Johnson reported, the dozens of decolonized African nations had already experienced 64 military coups. Less than a decade later, 20 of the 41 independent African countries were ruled by military juntas and the rest were dominated by coups, wars, uprisings, massacres, starvation and sadistic rulers. None were democracies.<br>(Speaking of Congo, when Belgium withdrew in 1960, it had a booming industrial base, the highest literacy rate and most hospital beds in Africa. Five days after Independence Day, the Congolese military erupted in an ecstasy of violence, looting, killing and raping whites.) <br>Importing the third world doesn&#39;t turn third-worlders into us, it turns us into the third world. One of our beloved African refugees was Beatrice Munyenyezi, a victim of the Rwandan genocide that former U.N. ambassador Samantha Power desperately tried to get us involved in. Then it turned out that Munyenyezi was a perpetrator, not a victim of the genocide. (Once again: I’m totally impressed with our immigration officials.) <br>And remember that nice pharmacist lady we brought in from Pakistan after she married an American? Within two years, Tashfeen Malik and her &quot;American-born&quot; husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, had committed mass murder in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 and injuring 22. According to the GAO, in the decade after 9/11, a majority of those convicted of terrorism offenses in the U.S. immigrated here legally. American police say they are being asked to respect Mexican rape culture when 13-year-old Hispanic girls are impregnated by 40-year-old men. One detective said he&#39;ll show up at the house of the girl, expecting the family to be in a blind rage, only to be told &quot;it’s a blessing and we’re so happy. I’ll explain it’s illegal, they cut me right off. I get a lot of those too.” <br>Cooper and Kristof’s other killer argument against the South African refugees is that they have... white privilege! Please apologize now.<br>&quot;These Afrikaners,&quot; Kristof said, &quot;are among the most privileged people on the entire continent,&quot; adding that they have &quot;assets 20 times greater than those of black South Africans on average.&quot; So what? Does having assets mean the government isn&#39;t trying to kill you? Jews had more assets in Germany. Kulaks had more assets in Russia. Or is Kristof suggesting it&#39;s OK to persecute people with assets? That would be bad news because you know where else whites have more assets than blacks? </div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R286" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">287</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/14/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2133px;left:-1px">TIẾT MỤC TUYỆT DIỆU CỦA THE FREE PRESS<br>Cùng một biến cố (bài diễn văn hôm Thứ Ba 13/5 của Donald Trump tại Riyadh) tờ báo giới thiệu bình luận của Batya Ungar-Sargon rồi của Eli Lake nhận định từ hai giác độ khác nhau.

In recent days, Trump has told aides he would consider getting Russia and Ukraine to talk directly and seriously - a win on its own, allowing the U.S. to pull back from the negotiations and focus on other priorities.<br>Trump has similarly launched quick-fire, high-stakes diplomatic initiatives, including nuclear talks with Iran, trade negotiations with China, a truce with Houthi rebels and cease-fire and hostage-release negotiations between Israel and Hamas, with whom the U.S. separately arranged the release of the last American hostage in Gaza.<br>Elsewhere, European Union officials approved a 17th round of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday, this time targeting some 200 ships that are deemed part of Moscow’s “shadow fleet” that transports illicit oil. Further sanctions are planned, with some officials acknowledging that what has been done so far hasn’t been enough to make Russia halt its invasion.<br>“This war has to end,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, wrote Wednesday on X. “We will keep the pressure high on the Kremlin.”<br>Write to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.com, Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com and Alexander Ward at alex.ward@wsj.com</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R288" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">289</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/14/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:4785px;left:-1px">TIẾT MỤC “ALL THINGS” CỦA KIMBERLEY STRASSEL:<br>Nếu giới dân cử Hoa Kỳ mà hiểu biết về luật lệ rắc rối như thành phần chủ biên của WSJ là Kim Strassel (đang sống với các con tại tiểu bang Alaska!) thì dân Mỹ đỡ khổ chừng nào.<br>Đọc kỹ bài tuần này mới thấy hành lang quốc hội Mỹ là khu bàn cờ toàn bẫy xập!<br>https://www.wsj.com/.../green-new-deal-rollback-db5df79a...<br>All Things<br>(A newsy analysis of the workings of D.C. (and beyond), providing the inside track on both the overhyped and overlooked events of the week.)<br>Green New Deal Rollback<br>House Republicans on Tuesday marked up final pieces of their reconciliation bill, and there’s enough material to keep policy wonks and lobbyists busy for weeks. Free marketers are finding items to both cheer and boo, and the WSJ editorial page goes through lowlights and highlights here, here and here. The big takeaway - the GOP pulled its punches in a lot of policy areas to mollify moderates and Donald Trump populists.<br>But one area where the GOP looks to have been a bit more aggressive was in rolling back Joe Biden’s Green New Deal. Biden threw hundreds of billions at the left’s climate hysteria - while imposing crushing new mandates - and then directed his administration to use its final days in office to shovel as much of of the money out the door as possible. But many programs and provisions remain fair game, and the GOP is going after some of the biggies. A rundown:<br>* The numbers: House Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie (R., Ky.) wrote that his committee’s bill will claw back $6.5 billion in unspent funds from Biden’s misnamed Inflation Reduction Act. Ways and Means is also cutting some “clean credits,” a move that on paper reduces spending by more than $500 billion, but comes with important caveats (see below).<br>* Electric Vehicles: The Ways and Means bill phases out and terminates the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles, the $4,000 tax credit for used EVs, and a commercial EV credit. The last two will terminate at the end of this year. The tax credit for new private EV purchases ostensibly continues through 2026, though Congress is reinstating the 200,000 cap on the number of consumer vehicles per manufacturer that qualify for the credit - which most carmakers have already hit. These provisions alone will save taxpayers about $190 billion.<br>* Housing tax credits: Ways and Means would repeal at the end of this year tax credits for homeowners who make energy-efficient improvements or buy “clean energy” equipment for their homes, as well as credits for contractors that build energy-efficient homes.<br>* Grants, subsidies and loans: The Energy Committee bill pulls back money from the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, the politicized $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, “environmental justice grants,” various Inflation Reduction Act subsidy programs for renewables and electrification, and a grab bag of others handouts. It even takes aim at some spending outside the Inflation Reduction Act, cutting more than $400 million, for instance, from the Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.<br>* Tailpipe emissions: One of the best parts of the Energy Committee’s bill is its killing of the Biden EPA “tailpipe emissions” standards, finalized last year, which was a de facto federal mandate for EVs that would have eliminated gasoline-powered vehicles. That mandate was also costly for the federal government, as it turbocharged the EV tax credit and reduced federal gasoline-tax revenue. The bill similarly repeals Biden’s corporate average fuel standards for model years 2027 and later.<br>* Disappointments: Republicans bragged they were ending “special interest giveaways” - which is spin. The Ways and Means bill phases out certain production tax credits and investment tax credits for wind, solar and other renewables - but the phaseouts don’t begin until 2029 - when there could be a Democratic president. Ditto other energy giveaways. This looks more like the usual budget gimmick: promise a phaseout or termination down the road, then provide a reprieve. The legislation does at least end transferability - a feature of the Inflation Reduction Act - which allowed project sponsors to sell credits, and also includes some new restrictions on the ability of certain “foreign influenced entities” to receive them.<br>Trump campaigned on much of this, including the end of taxpayer support for EVs, noting that the Green New Deal agenda was punishing automakers, industry and consumer choice. Some Republicans are still begging to keep the taxpayer handouts rolling to their districts, and the liberal media is wailing about the death of “clean energy.” The rollback is instead an admission that this federal gusher of subsidies is highly distortionary to markets, has hiked prices, and is standing in the way of Donald Trump’s more broad-based energy agenda. Here’s to hoping the provisions survive the Senate process.<br>CONGRESS&#39;S LIBRARY OF AGENCY CONFUSION<br>[Quá hay vì ít ai biết!]<br>Democrats and the media are in an uproar over Trump’s abrupt firing of Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer complaining that the president is treating “federal appointments like reality TV prizes.” Yet the mess is best laid in Congress’s lap, and just the latest in a broader debate about the role and power of Washington agencies.<br>The Trump team notified Hayden of her termination last Thursday, though her 10-year term wasn’t due to end until next year. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt in Friday’s press briefing said the administration “felt she did not fit the needs of the American people.” Trump has since appointed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as acting librarian, and Democrats are demanding legislation that would give a congressional commission the power to appoint the librarian - stripping that authority from the president.<br>Yet Congress might have done that any time up to now. The Library of Congress is what many call a “legislative agency,” which mostly exists to assist Congress in carrying out its duties. Other legislative agencies include the Government Accountability Office, the Government Publishing office, and the Architect of the Capitol. These entities are different from executive branch departments and from the “independent” agencies Congress created to perform executive functions (for instance the National Labor Relations Board or the Federal Election Commission). It was Thomas Jefferson who signed legislation in 1802 giving the president the power to appoint the Librarian of Congress (subject to Senate confirmation), a model that has governed the choosing of leadership for some legislative agencies ever since.<br>Only in recent years has Congress moved to give itself authority to make more of these appointments. In 2022, a former architect of the Capitol, J. Brett Blanton, refused to resign even after an inspector general report found he had abused his office; Biden fired him. Congress then changed the law to give a congressional commission sole power to appoint or remove the architect - though it notably didn’t extend that power to other agencies. Which meant Congress left the door wide open for Trump to fire the librarian. This fight meanwhile occurs alongside a separate legal brawl over who in Washington governs “independent” agencies. Maybe by the end, Congress and the White House - after 248 years - will know who is actually in charge of what?<br>RIGHTSIZING FEDERAL BENEFITS<br>Another overlooked piece of the GOP reconciliation bill: a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee overhaul of the federal pension system, an overdue effort to bring a pinch of reality to the government’s generous pension system, and one that will save federal taxpayers close to $50 billion over the next 10 years.<br>A little-known fact: Most of the federal government’s nearly three million civil employees receive a straight-up pension that, for a significant number, is collected in addition to Social Security benefits. The feds spend more than $90 billion a year just on these pension benefits. The committee changes would ask most employees to contribute 4.4% annually to their own pensions; right now, only newer hires contribute at that level. Employees will be expected to contribute at higher rates still if they refuse to become “at will” employees (losing some union protections against termination). The reform would also tweak the formula for determining retirement benefits and eliminate a special perk most federal retirees get if they retire before they turn 62 (a monetary payout that lasts until Social Security kicks in).<br>Private-sector workers won’t consider most of these changes over the top, as few of them receive a guaranteed pension or special worker protections in the first place. Benefits for federal workers per hour cost far more than benefits for private-sector workers.<br>Federal unions are livid about the alterations, and at least one Republican, Ohio’s Mike Turner, voted against the reform when the committee passed its portion of the reconciliation bill. No word yet on whether Turner considers the changes a deal-killer in any final House vote, but the dispute is a reminder of just how many issues remain at play in a final House vote - one in which Speaker Mike Johnson can’t afford to lose more than three members of his Republican team.<br>By the Numbers (Ways &amp; Means Edition):<br>[5] Billions of dollars the House Ways and Means reconciliation bill proposes to spend annually on a new tax credit for donations to a first ever federal school-choice scholarship program.<br>[10] Thousands of dollars Americans would be able to deduct from their federal taxes in interest on car loans under the bill.

The bill also increases the top rate of the excise tax on the nation’s largest foundations to 10%, up from today’s 1.3%<br>[25] U.S. states that will lose access to the IRS’s Direct File program, which would be eliminated by the bill. The bill also increases the maximum penalty for the unauthorized disclosure of taxpayers information to $250,000, up from $5,000 now, and clarifies that a separate violation occurs for each taxpayers’ information that is released (to avoid a repeat of the Charles Littlejohn travesty).<br>State of the States<br>Florida is these days considered a vanguard of conservative reform, with transplants flocking to its shores and generally rewarding Republican governance. How’s that new mix of voters looking at issues today? The James Madison Institute publishes an intriguing statewide poll, which includes the following interesting findings: Floridians are (relatively) down on property taxes, up on multichild families, very worried by the costs of tariffs, and in search of dentists. </div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R289" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">290</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/14/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:5730px;left:-1px">TRUMP BỊ ERDOGAN CHO HÚP MẬT NÊN TỐI MẮT!<br>Khi Syria đổi chủ, lãnh tụ Bashar al Assad chạy qua Nga hôm mùng tám Tháng 12 năm ngoái và al-Sharaa lên thay, ai cũng thấy bàn tay của ‘người hùng’ Erdogan, một thần tượng khác của Trump! <br>Nay thì hiểu tại sao Turkey lại làm môi giới cho việc ‘đàm phán’ về Ukraine....<br>https://thespectator.com/.../donald-trump-met-syria.../<br>Why Trump met Syria’s interim president<br>Ahmed al-Sharaa is the former al-Qaeda and ISIS firebrand turned interim leader of Syria<br>(Owen Matthews - The Spectator - Wednesday, May 14, 2025)<br>al-sharaa<br>President Donald Trump meets with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa along with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman al-Saud in Riyadh (Getty)<br>Few career arcs in modern history can be as remarkable as that of Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa – or Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, to give him the nom de guerre under which he fought American troops in Iraq back when he was a firebrand member of al-Qaeda. Twenty years ago al-Sharaa was languishing in a US military prison in Baghdad, held on suspicion of terrorism. Today, as Syria’s new interim President, he shook hands with Donald Trump posing for photo-calls alongside the de-facto ruler of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman.<br>Trump was evidently impressed by al-Sharaa, who has swapped the turban and dusty fatigues that he habitually wore before taking Damascus by storm last winter for a plain blue suit and purple tie. “He’s a young attractive guy. Strong past, very strong past – fighter,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after the meeting in Riyadh. “He’s got a real shot at holding [Syria] together… It’s a torn-up country.”<br>Between the US-led invasion of Iraq in April 2003 and its withdrawal two decades later, some 4,300 American troops were killed by Iraqi insurgents and foreign volunteer fighters like al-Sharaa – along with between 112,000 to 210,000 civilians. As the chaos in Iraq wound down in 2011 al-Sharaa was released after a five-year stint in an American-run prison camp and returned to Syria, where he had grown up and attended two years of medical school before joining the jihad. But his career as a pyrotechnician of civil war and mayhem was just getting started as the Arab Spring insurgency against the Assad regime kicked off with a nationwide uprising. Al-Sharaa – very much neither reformed nor chastened by his time in US custody – traveled to Damascus with bags full of cash as the lieutenant of Islamic State founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. His mission was to found the Syrian branch of ISIS, squeeze out the moderate anti-Assad opposition and turn the resistance into a jihad. <br>Al-Sharaa, it seems, is a hard man to kill. He survived multiple air raids by the US, British and Russian forces, backed by occasional covert special forces operations. Breaking away from ISIS, he became the Emir of the al-Nusra Front and later created another al-Qaeda splinter group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. After the destruction of the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in 2017, HTS fighters created a mini-state on a pocket of land in Idlib province near the Turkish border. And in the kaleidoscope of shifting factional politics, HTS also found a new protector in the form of the Turkish military. And it was with the backing of Turkey’s strongman President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that al-Sharaa led his fighters in a surprise assault first on Aleppo and then Damascus last year. Assad’s forces, and his regime, collapsed like a house of cards.<br>Today al-Sharaa is trying to project a new image – not as a jihadi terrorist but a tolerant leader of a multinational, multi-confessional Syria. “In the future Syria, we believe that diversity is our strength, not a weakness,” read one of Jolani/al-Sharaa’s early edicts on taking control of Aleppo in December 2024. His fighters swapped the black banner of the al-Nusra Front for the old flag of the Syrian Republic that dated back to before the 1963 Baath party revolution that brought the Assads to power. Nonetheless, HTS remained on the US terror list – and al-Sharaa personally had a $10 million bounty on his head until it was quietly removed in the first weeks of his de-facto leadership of Syria.<br>Is it appalling cynicism or sensible pragmatism for Trump to shake a hand that is figuratively, and possibly literally, stained with Americans’ blood? History is full of examples of respectable world leaders doing deals with the twentieth century’s most notorious devils. Nixon and Mao met on cordial diplomatic terms, as did Churchill and Stalin, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and the Emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa, Yizhak Rabin and Yassir Arafat. Even Britain’s long-suffering late Majesty the Queen was obliged by various of her prime ministers to extend full state welcome to both Bashir-al Assad and Vladimir Putin – as well as to shake hands with former IRA terrorist Martin McGuinness. <br>Trump is undoubtedly taking his lead from Erdoğan, who sponsored al-Sharaa’s power grab and who is clearly banking on his protegé to bring a semblance of stability to war-ravaged Syria. “I spoke with President Erdoğan, who is very friendly with [al-Sharaa],” Trump told the press. Erdoğan “feels he’s got a shot of doing a good job.” <br>Indeed the context of the Riyadh meeting was to push through a rapprochement between Damascus and Jerusalem that is part of a long-term Saudi strategy to isolate its arch-nemesis, Iran, and cut off its regional tries to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Trump, the Saudis, the Turks and the Israelis are all pushing al-Sharaa to sign the Abraham Accords – a US-led initiative which aims to normalize relations between Israel and Arab nations. Part of that deal will be to force “all foreign terrorists to leave Syria,” according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Which is of course ironic as those foreign terrorists – including the murderous British fanatics known as the Beatles who cold-bloodedly murdered US and British hostages – were until recently al-Sharaa’s comrades-in-arms in ISIS. <br>Peace makes for strange bedfellows – and nowhere more so than in the Middle East. Al-Sharaa’s claims to have been reborn as a tolerant democratic leader were shaken in March by a series of massacres of up to 1,500 Alawites, a heterodox brand of Shiite Islam followed by the now-exiled Assad family. Al-Sharaa condemned the violence and blamed it on pro-Assad groups. “We won’t accept that any blood be shed unjustly, or goes without punishment or accountability, even among those closest to us,” he said.  <br>Trump was shaking hands with a future peaceful leader of a post-war Syria, rather than the former terrorist and possible murderer of Americans. Or to put it another way, he put political pragmatism before gesture politics. Perhaps some time soon he will do the same with Vladimir Putin.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R290" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">291</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/14/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:6314px;left:-1px">ĐỌC BÀI NÀY HIỂU NGAY NÃO TRẠNG CỦA TRUMP<br>Thì Canada cũng như Hawaii, sẽ là một tiểu bang của Mỹ.

But he is still upending global trade. Trump has established baseline ten percent tariffs on most imports. He has made those levies higher for a variety of specific goods, including steel. And he slapped 145 percent tariffs on imports from China, the world’s largest manufacturer, although he has now agreed to cut this rate to 30 percent. The result has been a raft of trade wars between Washington and other governments, Beijing foremost among them.<br>Trump’s disruptions to the global economy are serious, and they may feel novel. But today’s situation is hardly without precedent. One does not have to look especially far back to see what the president’s tariffs might do to the world. The problems the global economy now faces echo some that existed before the 1995 creation of the World Trade Organization and others that existed even before the WTO’s predecessor, the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Until those bodies helped standardize commerce, countries frequently used trade to extract concessions from one another. They created and exploited what economists call “hold-up problems”: when one state or firm makes an investment in another in which profits depend on the continuation of the relationship. For example, one country could build oil infrastructure in another country that the supplier alone can service or operate. Once such deals are concluded, powerful countries can coerce their partners simply by threatening to change the terms of the agreement.<br>In the near term, countries can benefit from wielding trade as a cudgel. But in the long term, trade wars leave almost everyone worse off. When countries frequently use economic leverage to secure concessions from vulnerable partners, investment and economic growth go down. Political instability, meanwhile, goes up. States that chafe at economic coercion sometimes turn to their militaries in order to fight back. Countries that once cooperated because of commercial ties turn into competitors. Even close allies drift apart. Trump may think his tariff regime will make the United States richer, safer, and stronger. But history suggests it will do just the opposite.<br>PAIN WITHOUT GAIN<br>In the early nineteenth century, American traders began doing business with U.S. settlers in the kingdom of Hawaii. At the time, the islands’ economy revolved around sugar plantations, many of which were owned or controlled by American businessmen who exported sugar to the U.S. market. Eventually, to help the sugar farmers, the two countries struck the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, which eliminated tariffs on Hawaiian sugar entering the United States. In response, Hawaii’s sugar economy boomed.<br>Initially, this deal worked reasonably well for Hawaii, which grew much richer from the exports. But it made the kingdom ever more dependent on the United States, which was able to exploit this reliance to its advantage. Washington refused, for example, to renew the Reciprocity Treaty unless Hawaii gave it exclusive rights to Pearl Harbor. American officials then eliminated tariffs on all foreign sugar in the 1890s and gave domestic producers a subsidy to shield the U.S. industry from foreign competition and keep prices low. This deprived Hawaii of its cost advantage. Hawaiian planters were crushed, increasing support among the islands’ U.S. elite for annexation. The elite’s push was successful, despite overwhelming opposition by the native Hawaiian population.<br>Hawaii was hardly the only country victimized by trade dependence. The United States and European countries had their investments in railroads, mines, and oil infrastructure in Mexico after Mexico expropriated them both outright and through regulator changes. Their banks and railways in China were attacked by the Qing dynasty. Western investments in Cuba were sabotaged under Spanish colonial rule. Perhaps most famously, Germany used its status as one of the largest importers of eastern European agriculture to gain political influence in that region before World War II.<br>These risks, in turn, suppressed overall economic exchange. No countries wanted to be conquered or coerced, so many of them steered clear of international commerce. The founders of the United States feared that economic dependence on the United Kingdom would give London undue influence even after they won the Revolutionary War, so they curtailed transatlantic trade. Qing China feared that trade dependence was a security vulnerability and likewise held back from global markets. Imperial Russia embraced autarky in the late nineteenth century to avoid vulnerability. In the 1930s, Japan went so far as to seize Manchuria in order to create an autarkic bloc that would supply Tokyo with raw materials without having to negotiate with the West.<br>In this rough-and-tumble era, trade wars were frequent and destabilizing. Sometimes, they helped produce outright conflict. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which raised U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 goods, prompted a global trade war that intensified geopolitical rivalries and helped push Germany, Italy, and Japan toward autarky and expansionism. Most famously, after the United States placed tariffs, embargoes, and export controls on Japanese oil, scrap metal, and aviation fuel, Tokyo struck Pearl Harbor in 1941. Trade tensions have featured in many other military conflicts, as well. Trade pressure and maritime coercion, for example, also helped lead to the War of 1812.<br>There still were bright moments for trade in the pre-WTO era, especially after World War II ended. In 1979, for instance, China and the United States normalized ties, and in 1980, the latter country granted the former permanent normal trade relations - preferential tariff treatment under U.S. law. But for two decades, the U.S. Congress had to vote yearly to renew China’s normal trade status, which legislators conditioned on Beijing making human rights and nonproliferation concessions. Although Congress always granted this status, the recurring uncertainty depressed trade and investment, as firms hesitated to engage deeply with a partner whose access to the American market could be revoked at any time. Economic actors, after all, require stable, predictable frameworks to make long-term investments.<br>In response, Beijing pushed to join the WTO from the moment it was created, hoping the body could guarantee Chinese manufacturers predictable global access. This effort sparked fierce debate within the United States about whether to permit accession. Advocates of integration argued that tying China’s economy to the world’s would deter China from launching military conflicts, lest it risk a cutoff, and encourage political liberalization. Opponents feared that economic integration before political liberalization would only strengthen an authoritarian competitor. Ultimately, the optimists prevailed: Washington allowed Beijing to join the WTO in 2001. The organization then alleviated China’s hold-up problems by prohibiting the United States from threatening tariff hikes each year. The Chinese economy, already expanding at a healthy rate, began to grow even faster.<br>For the WTO, Chinese accession was a triumph. The organization was created to increase trade everywhere and stop countries from using commerce as a weapon, and integrating the world’s most populous country (and a former U.S. adversary) suggested the body was having its intended effect. And at the time, it was - countries typically obeyed the WTO’s common rules, listened to its adjudicators, and played along with its enforcement tribunals. The resulting system was hardly perfect; it failed, for example, to stop China from using industrial policy as a means to promote specific sectors or companies, often at the expense of foreign firms, or from restricting exports to countries that criticized Beijing. But for the most part, the WTO was quite successful. Trade flourished, and the global economy grew more quickly than it otherwise would have.<br>BACK TO THE FUTURE<br>Then came the 2016 election of Trump. The president, always a critic of free trade, quickly went about abandoning and dismantling the WTO framework - taking opposition to the body to a whole new level. The United States, once the organization’s biggest champion, largely stopped listening to WTO guidance. It adopted trade practices that outright violated the body’s rules. And it paralyzed the organization’s appellate body in order to further weaken the system. Instead, Washington’s leaders reembraced a transactional view of trade, deploying tariffs as blunt instruments of punishment and coercion. Hold-up problems, once thought tamed, returned with a vengeance. Long-term investment and cross-border economic planning became riskier as geopolitical considerations reasserted themselves.<br>During Trump’s first term, these policies helped spur a more defensive posture by the United States’ trade partners. The EU, for example, devised new geoeconomic policies such as its anti-coercion instrument, which allows the bloc to respond to economic coercion by imposing tariffs, restricting access to EU markets, or suspending international obligations. China and the United States began to separate out investments. Such actions may well have suppressed both trade and foreign direct investment, although the declines in both are difficult to disentangle from the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. But even if Trump’s policies mattered little the first time around, that does not mean they will have trivial effects now. The first Trump administration featured many advisers who prevented the president from unleashing the kind of broad-based tariffs that he has implemented in 2025. Today, firms face even greater uncertainty. As a result, Chinese companies are already intensifying efforts to eliminate foreign components from their supply chains. So is the EU.<br>Trump’s tariffs are unlikely to help the U.S. economy. They will probably fail at their main stated goal - bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States - because businesses will be reluctant to invest more at home when Washington keeps making and breaking trade agreements. The White House, after all, could instantly render whatever domestic factories companies build unprofitable by slashing tariffs. Trump also wants to use the leverage from the tariffs to compel countries to sign bilateral agreements with the United States, as was common before the advent of the multilateral trading system, but these deals will not do much to encourage investment, either. Unlike in a multilateral system, bilateral agreements are difficult to enforce and thus difficult for countries and firms to trust. In a bilateral system, trading partners also constantly worry that whatever agreement they sign with the United States will be undercut by a new deal between Washington and a different government. The result is even more uncertainty and thus less investment.<br>Trump’s trade war, in other words, will likely have similar economic effects as trade wars past. It could also have similar political consequences. Alliances may fray as countries look to hedge their bets, diversifying economic ties rather than simply trusting their partners. Governments will use tariffs to try to weaken competitors. Trump has already apparently used tariffs in an effort to annex Canada (in a strange redux of U.S. policy toward Hawaii), saying that Canada could avoid tariffs by becoming an American state and threatening “economic force” if it doesn’t. In response, Canadians have pivoted away from the United States, including by boycotting U.S. products. So have people in other countries; for example, overall favorability ratings of the United States have fallen across Western Europe since Trump won.<br>The United States is unlikely to attack any of these countries outright, although Trump has threatened Danish-controlled Greenland. But by reducing mutual dependency, his tariffs do lower the costs of military confrontation. If the United States reduces its economic reliance on Taiwanese semiconductors, for instance, Beijing might decide that Washington won’t respond if China blockades or invades the island. Conversely, in a more transactional world, countries could use whatever dependencies still exist to gain a political advantage - as Berlin did with agriculture in the 1930s. Russia, in particular, has long used such tactics by manipulating the price of oil and gas to extract political concessions from countries in its periphery, contributing to regional conflict.<br>Moscow’s tactics have naturally led many nearby states to diversify away from Russia. Now, similar tactics are also costing the United States. But should Washington lose its economic credibility, the result could be far more destabilizing than is the case for countries that do not trust the Kremlin. Washington’s ability to stand by its agreements has been the backbone of many essential global institutions, including NATO. It is a key reason the dollar is the world’s reserve currency. Without reliable frameworks, international politics will become more uncertain and volatile, making miscalculation and conflict more likely. The situation could start to resemble the lead-up to World War II, which partially resulted from the collapse of the League of Nations and the failure of European powers to nip German expansionism in the bud.<br>Trump may ultimately reduce some of his levies, particularly as he negotiates with more and more countries. He has already made a trade deal with the United Kingdom. But the president has abandoned the institutions and norms that once stabilized global trade. In doing so, he is ushering in an era not of renewed American strength but of stagnation, fragmentation, and danger.

This chart shows the evolution of President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods since taking office. The new 30% rate is much lower than 145%, but still considerably higher than it was in January. <br>Source: Dario Perkins <br>[Coi đồ biểu của Dario Perkins thấy Trump làm bộ nói thách!]<br>Additional 25% tariffs apply to some goods like steel, aluminum, and automotive parts. It is not clear as we write whether these will be stacked on top of the 30% general tariff. But in any case, even 30% rates are still enough to reduce business profits and/or raise consumer prices. The bigger problem is we still don’t know where this is going. [Thế mới thảm!]<br>A 90-day pause doesn’t give businesses the long-term stability they need to make growth plans. It also leaves enough inflation pressure to probably keep the Fed from cutting rates until late this year, at the soonest. <br>2/ DC HOMES<br>Washingtion, DC, has been called a “company town,” the company being the federal government which DOGE is trying to downsize. This may already be having local economic effects. The chart shows annual change in home sale listings in the Washington metro area. The latest data shows listings growing at the fastest pace since 2015. <br>Source: Liz Ann Sonders [số nhà rao bán tại thủ đô tăng vọt từ giữa năm 2023, rồi sau ba tháng đầu năm nay lại tăng nữa!]<br>However, this is a volatile data series with wild swings even before the COVID era. The current uptrend dates back to mid-2023, so it’s not clear how much DOGE has to do with this. Whatever the reason, anyone who is house hunting in the DC area will have more choices than they did a few years ago. <br>3/ A TRILLION HERE, A TRILLION THERE<br>President Trump’s 2026 budget proposal requests $1.0 trillion for defense spending. This chart places that number in historical context, showing the Pentagon’s annual budget, adjusted for inflation. <br>Source: Stephen Semler <br>A $1 trillion+ defense budget, if approved, will be comparable to the amounts spent during World War II or the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. This also matters economically. More than half the defense budget goes to private contractors, mainly US companies. This flows into the economy as both profits and payroll. Higher defense spending may or may not enhance national defense but will certainly have a stimulative effect on the economy. It will also raise the national debt unless offset by other spending cuts. <br>[Ngân sách quốc phòng ngàn tỷ, cao bằng thời chiến, mà cũng tạo ra số cầu về sản xuất nội địa - và số tiền đi vay!]<br>4/ WAGE GROWTH, SOMETIMES<br>Here’s a long-term look at US median wage growth adjusted for PCE inflation. Ernie Tedeschi of Yale’s Budget Lab, who made the chart, added this comment: “I look at this graph and I see real wages that are 1) up over the long-run, 2) most responsive to tight labor markets, 3) susceptible to periods of stagnation, sometimes extended periods.” <br>Source: Ernie Tedeschi <br>To his first point, mid-tier worker real income roughly doubled in six decades. This indicates productivity rose faster than inflation. The fastest wage growth occurred in periods of high GDP growth and/or labor force constraints. In the 1960s, for example, most of the Baby Boom generation was still below working age, women faced significant barriers, and many men were in the military. Civilian wages rose accordingly. <br>Yet there are also periods of stagnation, highlighted in the pink boxes we added. The longest occurred in the 1970s and early 1980s, a period of high inflation. The last one was during the 2008 recession. Wage growth has been solid since then - perhaps due to demographic constraints. That part of the line resembles the 1960s portion. Let’s hope it doesn’t end the same way. <br>5/ A BIGGER FLORIDA<br>The green area shows Florida’s coastline during the last ice age, when much of the ocean was locked up in polar ice caps and glaciers. Since people tend to live near water, that now-inundated coastal area probably contained early human settlements. What was their economy like?

In its announcement that it will nullify the election of David Hogg and another Vice Chair, the DNC reminded the public why they have left the Democratic Party. The sudden decision that there were procedural irregularities in the election (after Hogg said that he would target older Democratic incumbents) leaves the DNC looking more like the CCP. However, it gets worse.<br>Hogg caused a controversy by announcing that he will work to primary older Democratic incumbents through his group, Leaders We Deserve, to bring young candidates into the party. The leadership ordered him to retract the pledge or resign. He did neither.<br>Then, the DNC announced that there were “irregularities” in how he and Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta won two of the three vice chair positions.<br>The reason? One of the losing candidates, Kalyn Free, filed a complaint during the original election alleging that the DNC failed to follow rules on gender diversity.<br>If you recall, the Democratic Party was widely mocked over the difficulty of the DNC leadership to explain its convoluted rules for guaranteeing gender and racial diversity. It became a parody of itself.<br>This is just one of the efforts to explain the rules:<br>Jamie Harrison eventually had to turn it over to another DNC member who had equal difficulty explaining the gender equality rules and procedures:<br>    HARRISON: “Because of our gender balance provisions on this next ballot, you will be able to vote for two candidates of any gender on the next ballot. OK? So on this next ballot, you will be able to vote for two candidates of any gender on the next<br>    ballot. If two candidates receive — I’m going to turn to Helen to clarify this last part.”<br>    UNKNOWN FEMALE: “You are in this next ballot where you have two votes. As the chair has said, you may vote for two males, two females, two of any gender. OK? No, you can’t do that. Because we’ve got to balance. You could vote for one of any gender, OK? Non-binary gender. Excuse me. It is late. OK?”<br>After she lost, Free filed her complaint. It would have been an easy matter to determine if there was an invalid balloting but the DNC moved on…for months.<br>After Hogg refused to recant or resign, the DNC then issued this procedural excuse to negate the election.<br>For many, the exercise seemed yet another manipulation by the DNC after it refused to have a real debate over the nomination of Kamala Harris and simply held a coronation at the convention after she failed to secure a single primary vote. Despite spending over $1.2 billion, she lost to Trump.<br>DNC members rushed forward to insist that this was just a coincidence and had nothing to do with Hogg’s controversy.<br>However, they then contradicted that claim in comments to the media as Hogg himself said that it was about his campaign to bring in young voters.<br>One former official told the media, “This is not about David Hogg, despite what he’s saying. It is gender balance…. It’s in the rules that the officers need to be balanced between men and women.” However, the same official then added “The full DNC now gets to vote again. If they like what Hogg is doing then that’s great, and he’ll be re-elected. It was disingenuous to not reveal his intentions the first time before they voted. While it has nothing to do with him, it’s an elected position so now we’ll find out if the party supports it or not, which they very well may.”<br>Another former official insisted that the vote was needed because “either Hogg is wrong and misled members or they think he’s doing the right thing. Either way, it’ll be settled. And he can’t complain. A re-vote is not forcing him out, there are other ways to do that if they chose to.”<br>I grew up in a liberal Democratic family in Chicago and spent much of my life working for Democratic politicians. It has been astonishing to watch the current Democratic leadership destroy their own party with identity politics and radical agendas.<br>Yet, this takes the cake.

It was a declaration of deterrence.<br>From their perch at Jiupeng military base [Căn cứ Cửu Phong]- where steep green ridges descend toward the Pacific - Taiwanese forces fired the U.S.-made rocket artillery system in a live-fire display designed to show how the island is transforming itself into a fortress of modern asymmetric warfare. The Taiwanese unit conducting the test had trained with U.S. forces in Oklahoma in 2024, and this week’s exercise marked the first time they demonstrated their proficiency with HIMARS on home soil.<br>The HIMARS platform - demonstrated in footage provided to The Bureau from Taiwan Plus - signals a decisive shift toward a mobile, nimble defensive force designed to face overwhelming scale. Unlike fixed missile sites or air bases - prime targets expected to be destroyed within hours of a PLA first-wave assault - truck-mounted HIMARS units can slip into position, launch a strike, and quickly vanish into Taiwan’s jungle-thick terrain and cliffside roads. These launchers are meant to hide, hit, and move - relying on camouflage, speed, and the natural topography of the island to stay alive and strike again.<br>This transformation had been quietly underway for years. In September 2023, The Bureau met with Taiwanese military strategists and international journalists at a closed-door roundtable in Taipei. Among them was a Ukrainian defense consultant - invited to share hard-won battlefield lessons from Kyiv’s resistance. The strategist told the group that the most crucial lesson for Taiwan was psychological: to instill in citizens and soldiers alike the will to prepare for aggression that seems impossible and illogical, before it arrives. “You must believe the worst can happen,” the Ukraine vet said.<br>That same week in Taipei, Taiwan’s then-Foreign Minister Joseph Wu made the case directly in an interview:<br>“There&#39;s a growing consensus among the key analysts in the United States and also in Taiwan that war is not inevitable and the war is not imminent,” Wu said. “And we have been making significant investment in our own defense - not just increasing our military budget, but also engaging serious military reforms, in the sense of asymmetric strategy and asymmetric capability.”<br>That principle now guides Taiwan’s evolving force posture. The May 12 HIMARS test - launching precision-guided rockets into a Pacific exclusion zone - was the first public demonstration of the mobile artillery system since the U.S. delivered the first batch in late 2024. With a range of 300 kilometers, HIMARS provides not only mobility but standoff power, allowing Taiwan’s forces to strike amphibious staging areas, beachheads, and ships from hardened inland positions. Lockheed Martin engineers observed the drills, which were broadcast across Taiwanese news networks as both a military signal and psychological campaign.<br>The live-fire exercise also marked the debut of the Land Sword II, a domestically developed surface-to-air missile system designed to counter diverse aerial threats, including cruise missiles, aircraft, and drones. Land Sword II adds a mobile, all-weather air defense layer to Taiwan’s increasingly dense multi-domain network. By deploying it alongside HIMARS, Taiwan demonstrated its commitment to building overlapping shields - striking at invading forces while protecting its launch platforms from aerial suppression.<br>But these new missile systems are only the tip of the spear.<br>Taiwan’s military has quietly abandoned the vestiges of a Cold War posture centered on fleet battles and long-range missile parity with the mainland. Defense officials now concede that attempts to match Beijing plane-for-plane or ship-for-ship are a dead end. Instead, inspired by the “porcupine” concept outlined by retired U.S. Marines and intelligence officials, Taiwan is remaking itself into a smart, lethal archipelago fortress - one where unmanned drones, dispersed missile cells, and underground fiber-linked command posts neutralize China’s numerical advantage.<br>Wu, who now serves as Secretary-General of Taiwan’s National Security Council, has been one of the doctrine’s most consistent advocates. In his writings and interviews, Wu points to Ukraine’s ability to hold off a vastly superior invader through mobility, deception, and smart munitions. “We are not seeking parity. We are seeking survivability,” he wrote in Foreign Affairs. “And if we survive, we win.”<br>A New Arsenal of Ideas: From Silicon Valley to the Taiwan Strait<br>If Ukraine showed the value of agile, off-the-shelf technologies on the battlefield, Taiwan seems poised to go a step further - by integrating cutting-edge systems developed not by defense contractors, but by Silicon Valley insurgents.<br>Among the most closely watched innovators is Palmer Luckey, the former Oculus founder whose defense firm, Anduril Industries, is quietly revolutionizing battlefield autonomy. Through its Dive Technologies division and flagship Ghost and Bolt drone platforms, Anduril builds AI-guided aerial and underwater drones capable of swarming enemy ships, submarines, and even mines - exactly the kinds of systems Taiwan could deploy along its maritime approaches and chokepoints.<br>Luckey, who visited Japan and South Korea in early 2025 to brief U.S. allies on asymmetric AI warfare, has warned that in a Taiwan invasion scenario, the side with better autonomous targeting and tracking could determine victory before a single human-fired missile is launched.<br>“The PLA is betting big on AI,” he told Business Insider. “If Taiwan and the U.S. don’t match that, we’re done.”<br>Much of this strategy finds intellectual backing in The Boiling Moat, a 2024 strategy volume edited by former U.S. National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger [cự phách trong hệ thống lý luận chống Trung Cộng mà Trump 47 lại gạt qua một bên!]. The book proposes a multi-layered defense of Taiwan that includes hardened ground troops, swarming drones, portable anti-ship missiles, and AI battlefield networking.<br>Pottinger argues that Taiwan must become “the toughest target on earth”- a phrase now common among Taiwanese officers briefing American delegations. Speaking to NPR last year, Pottinger noted that Taiwan’s survival doesn’t rest on matching China’s power, but on “convincing Beijing that the price of conquest will be far too high to bear.”</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
