Khi đọc tin hai viên chức còn trẻ của tòa Đại sứ Israel bị giết, rồi hung thủ tự khoe công trạng, chúng ta chỉ còn biết thở dài như đã thấy vào Tháng Năm 2020 khi ‘Thánh’ George Floyd từ trần trong niềm tiếc thương của lãnh đạo Dân Chủ làm họ phải quỳ gối. <br>https://thespectator.com/.../israeli-embassy-terror.../<br>Israeli Embassy terror suspect formed by hard-left and BLM<br>The far-left has absorbed the theological and conspiratorial architecture of Islamic antisemitism<br>(Jonathan Sacerdoti - The Spectator - Thursday, May 22, 2025)<br>Elias Rodriguez<br>Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim<br>The murder last night of two young Israeli embassy staffers, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, on a street in Washington, DC was horrifying, but not surprising. The couple was gunned down outside the Capital Jewish Museum. A suspect then walked into the building, accepted water from those who thought he was a victim, and began chanting “Free Palestine.” He pulled a red keffiyeh from his pocket and invoked the old rallying cry: “There is only one solution. Intifada revolution.”<br>The man now in custody, Elias Rodriguez, was once associated with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a hard-left political group whose slogans echo in anti-Israel demonstrations across the country. In the hours before the shooting, the group posted: “End the genocide. Israel out of Gaza now.” Rodriguez had marched in their protests and spoken at their rallies. After the shooting, they disowned him with haste, but the slogans remained. The worldview remained. The atmosphere remained.<br>This was not the act of a lone figure drifting through conspiracy. It was the collision of ideology and permission. Rodriguez did not invent the language that filled his mouth after the murders. It was given to him – polished in activist workshops, passed around on college campuses, reinforced by social media algorithms and institutional silence. That language gave him certainty. It gave him moral clarity. And then it likely gave him a target.<br>American antisemitism has changed. The old forms never disappeared, but something else has emerged beside them – something sharper, more socially acceptable, more dangerous for its capacity to hide in plain sight. What used to belong to the political fringes now thrives at the heart of self-declared “progressive” culture. The far left has absorbed the theological and conspiratorial architecture of Islamic antisemitism and fused it with a distinctly Western aesthetic: the language of equity, resistance, and liberation. It no longer marches under swastikas. It marches under PLO flags, wearing keffiyehs and holding aloft banners declaring human rights and signs soaked in blood-red metaphors of genocide and apartheid.<br>Whether knowingly or not, this ideology does not distinguish between Israelis and Jews, between diplomats and soldiers. It sees every Jew connected to Israel as part of a structure to be “dismantled.” Its fantasies are drawn in absolutes, its slogans lifted directly from the rhetoric of terror movements. In all the furious rhetoric, the old instincts are laid bare for all to see. New language, same old message – blame the Jew, dehumanize the Jew, remove the Jew.<br>Rodriguez’s path is not unfamiliar. He studied literature. He worked in nonprofits. He protested with Black Lives Matter in Chicago. He wrote about injustice and power and inequality. From the outside, he looked like many others shaped by America’s culture of activism. But at some point, the language he spoke turned sour. It began telling him that the world’s horrors trace back to a single enemy. That resistance meant confrontation. That confrontation meant violence. Too often this message has echoed on campuses, politely excused in the left wing media, and repeated so often it has infected the brains of a whole generation of angry young people.<br>So inspired by the Palestinian culture the left idolizes, the killer brought the cause’s most famous cultural contribution to the streets of the capital of the free world: terrorism and bloodshed. And to think, some people want to create a whole state based on this ideology, right next to the only Jewish one.<br>No one should be surprised that this logic has arrived at murder. The slogans repeated endlessly – “from the river to the sea,” “by any means necessary,” “global intifada”– are not metaphors. They are invitations. And for those inclined to listen closely, they are instructions. If you tell a generation that Israel is a colonial imposition, that Jews are white oppressors, that Gaza is Auschwitz and the IDF is the SS, do not pretend to be shocked when someone opens fire at a Jewish event in a US city.<br>The institutions that ought to be confronting this – universities, media, political parties – have too often made excuses for it. Jew-hatred, when dressed in anti-Zionist garb, is tolerated, platformed, even celebrated. The standards applied to other hatreds are quietly suspended. The same universities that launch full-scale investigations into pronoun disputes allow their lecture halls to echo with calls for Jewish extermination, so long as the speaker mentions the fantasy state of Palestine.<br>The Trump White House moved quickly to condemn the murders – and to its credit, has shown far greater clarity and resolve on antisemitism than its predecessor. But beyond the administration, too many powerful voices continue to enable the very atmosphere that made this shooting possible. Just days earlier, the United Nations amplified one of the most grotesque blood libels in recent memory, warning the world that 14,000 babies in Gaza were at imminent risk of dying from starvation within 48 hours. The figure was false, the timeline absurd, and the implication unmistakable: that Jews were mass murderers of infants. It was the kind of narrative that stirs primal hatred, and yet it was broadcast with the solemnity of moral concern. Even now, after two Jews were gunned down on the streets of Washington, the UN Secretary-General’s statement managed to condemn the murders as if they occurred in a vacuum, with no reference to the culture of demonization his own institution has helped promote. These are not minor missteps. They are the foundations of the worldview that brought Elias Rodriguez to a Jewish event with a gun. And unless they are dismantled, he will not be the last.<br>A young man had bought a ring and was planning to propose. A young woman was at his side. They walked out of a museum and were assassinated for being Israeli. Their deaths did not emerge from nowhere. They emerged from an ideological climate that is becoming more fevered, more violent, and more sanctioned.<br>There is still time to dismantle the structures that produce this violence. But only if we are honest about where they are, and who is building them. The line from campus chants to bullets outside a Jewish museum is not abstract, but direct. It will not be the last if it is not broken.<br>Jonathan Sacerdoti</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R2" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">3</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ĐẢNG CỘNG SẢN TRUNG HOA LŨNG ĐOẠN CANADA TỪ LÂU RỒI!<br>Độc quyền của The Bureau: tay chân của đảng Cộng sản Trung Hoa (CCP) lũng đoạn chính trường Canada đã lâu và thực tế chi phối đảng Tự Do của đương kim Thủ tướng Mark Carney từ thời Thủ tướng Justin Trudeau!<br>https://www.thebureau.news/.../exclusive-ccp-tied-group...<br>Exclusive: CCP-Tied Group That Met Carney Joined 2019 United Front Gala at Wei Wei Mansion With Liberal Insiders—Months Before Casino Raid<br>(By Sam Cooper - The Bureau - May 22, 2025)<br>∙ Paid<br>TORONTO — New evidence reviewed by The Bureau reveals that the Jiangsu Commerce Council of Canada - the Chinese Communist Party-linked business group at the center of a controversial meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney during his leadership campaign - was among the key attendees of a lavish Lunar New Year gala in January 2019, attended by senior Liberal Party organizers and hosted by Wei Wei, a United Front affiliate and Chinese organized crime target, at one of Wei’s Toronto-area mansions.<br>A year later, another of Wei’s residences would become the focus of a high-level York Regional Police and CSIS investigation into underground casinos, weapons stockpiles, and transnational money laundering that police allege abetted international drug trafficking.<br>Evidence suggests Wei Wei’s properties were used for political donations to the Don Valley North Liberal Association, a campaign in Markham–Thornhill, and a Liberal nomination contestant in the Markham–Unionville riding.<br>One photo from the January 2019 gala at a Wei Wei mansion shows the host standing with three Jiangsu Commerce Council leaders, including a Liberal Party riding association boss for the Markham area. Another image from the event shows the same leaders alongside lawyer Bang-Gu Jiang - a former York Regional Police board member who contested the Liberal Party nomination for Don Valley North in 2019.<br>Elections Canada records show that both Wei Wei and the JCCC’s former president donated to Bang-Gu Jiang’s nomination effort in Markham–Unionville during Justin Trudeau’s tenure as Liberal leader.<br>The revelation deepens the controversy surrounding JCCC’s political access and linkages to figures investigated by Canadian police. During his campaign to become Prime Minister, Mark Carney denied meeting with JCCC leaders with links to Beijing’s United Front Work Department, after The Globe and Mail reported on the meeting.<br>The JCCC’s website was subsequently pulled offline. However, The Bureau published photographic and documentary evidence showing Carney did in fact attend a JCCC-sponsored event in Toronto - a high-level Chinese New Year reception involving key figures in the Liberal fundraising ecosystem. Among them were JCCC executives linked to a United Front PPE operation involving the same Markham riding boss photographed with Wei Wei at the January 2019 gathering at Wei’s lavish residence.<br>This Liberal Party official - listed as a director alongside Wei Wei of the Canada Hefei Friendship Association, which nominally hosted the January 2019 gala at Wei’s Toronto mansion - has long held fundraising and organizing roles for Liberal candidates across the Greater Toronto Area.<br>The newly surfaced 2019 gala - hosted on January 5, months ahead of the federal election - was held at one of Wei Wei&#39;s upscale Toronto-area homes and attended by over 40 community association leaders, business executives, and political operatives. While separate from his notorious 5 DeCourcy Court property, which was raided in a sweeping police operation, the interior photos confirm a similarly extravagant setting: crystal chandeliers, silk table settings, a decadent bar populated by dozens of wine and high-end Chinese liquor bottles, and banners for the Hefei Friendship Association (HFA).<br>Photographic and documentary evidence obtained by The Bureau confirms that among the attendees were Wei Wei, casually dressed and seated beneath red velvet lounge décor; the president of the Canada Hefei Friendship Association, who opened the gala with a speech promoting political and economic exchange with Anhui Province; Bang-Gu Jiang, a Liberal nomination contender in Don Valley North; and the Liberal riding boss tied to the JCCC, who played a central role in the party’s regional fundraising apparatus.<br>The gala also brought together leaders from the Confederation of Toronto Chinese Canadian Organizations (CTCCO), a group founded in 1985 and described in The Globe and Mail as linked to Peter Yuen, Carney’s chosen candidate to replace MP Paul Chiang in Markham–Unionville. According to The Globe, CTCCO is led by an individual who “has close ties to the Chinese consulate and attended sessions of the Chinese People’s Congress and Chinese People’s Consultative Conference, a top advisory body to President Xi Jinping.” That individual, along with the CTCCO, was debanked by TD Bank, which cited internal documents showing the organization’s transactions were flagged as involving “individuals or entity(ies) identified by media, law enforcement and/or intelligence agencies as being linked to criminal activities,” The Globe reported.<br>Yuen, a former Toronto Police deputy chief, ultimately failed to win the Markham riding after replacing MP Paul Chiang, a former York Region police officer who had resigned amid controversy for suggesting that Conservative candidate Joe Tay should be handed over to Chinese consular authorities in Toronto.<br>Bang-Gu Jiang, who unsuccessfully sought Liberal Party nominations under Justin Trudeau’s leadership, served on the York Regional Police Services Board from 2013 to 2018 as a provincial appointee. During her tenure, she played a direct role in governance, overseeing senior police executive appointments, operational budgeting, business planning, and the development of policing policies.<br>In 2014, Wei Wei donated $1,200 to Bang-Gu Jiang’s Liberal Party nomination campaign in Markham–Unionville. Another $1,200 came from Rui Jiang, a co-director of the Jiangsu Commerce Council of Canada, who has reportedly attended United Front-linked events with senior PRC officials - including Xi Jinping - and was pictured beside Mark Carney during the group’s 2025 New Year gala.<br>According to an intelligence source cited in The Bureau&#39;s earlier investigation into Wei Wei’s 5 DeCourcy mansion, a CSIS-linked warrant targeting United Front influence operations explicitly referenced Wei’s role with the Hefei Friendship Association.<br>Mandarin-language researchers assisting The Bureau’s investigation also discovered that a name matching Wei appears as a member of the Western Returned Scholars Association of Anhui in June 2018, and that this association is listed by the Anhui Province CCP United Front Work Department.<br>One Chinese-language report described the 2019 event at Wei Wei’s home, with guests enjoying homemade Anhui cuisine prepared in the host’s marble-appointed, high-end kitchen, a Brazilian dance performance by bikini-clad Latina dancers, and full bar service beneath a multi-tiered chandelier.<br>A separate report from JCCC described the event with similar details. An archived version - since pulled offline - praised the Canada Hefei Friendship Association’s ambition to position Toronto as a hub for Chinese diaspora cooperation - language that closely mirrors standard messaging associated with the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front Work Department. The report states that the Hefei group is controlled by the People&#39;s Consultative Conference of Hefei.<br>A message from JCCC posted to another event report - in language suggesting a tone of seniority - praised the HFA for its &quot;great progress,&quot; with sentences suggesting ideological alignment between the two organizations.<br>An additional source still online lists an astonishing number of associations attending the event, including the Yunnan, Ningxia, Hainan, Zhejiang, Quanzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, Fujian, Henan, Sichuan, and Jilin chambers of commerce, as well as the Canada-China Real Estate Investment Chamber.<br>The opulence of the setting - gold-trimmed chairs, marble bars, name-tagged Liberal Party members sipping cocktails under red-and-gold balloons - mirrored the fusion of wealth, politics, and foreign power projection. And it places at the center of that operation Wei Wei, a man who would soon become the subject of a national security and organized crime investigation involving York Regional Police, CSIS, and RCMP federal serious organized crime teams.<br>Project Endgame, a major York Regional Police operation, eventually targeted Wei’s mansion at 5 DeCourcy Court, which police allege had been transformed into an underground casino stocked with weapons, alcohol, and surveillance equipment. Officers seized more than $1 million in cash, $1.5 million in alcohol, 11 firearms, and arrested over 30 suspects on gambling, firearms, and money laundering charges. According to York Deputy Chief Brian Bigras, the casino profits were suspected to be funneled into broader criminal networks, including drug trafficking and prostitution. York police characterized the operation as demonstrating “opulence and audacity,” and CSIS joined the investigation amid concerns that compromising footage of political figures at the mansion could be used for blackmail or foreign interference.<br>Wei had multiple properties raided in 2020. On July 30, York Regional Police raided the 761 Woodland Acres residence in Vaughan, where they arrested Wei Wei, his wife Xiang Yue Chen, and daughter Chen Wei. Police also seized 51,000 Canadian dollars and 19,000 U.S. dollars in gambling cash at that location. According to Elections Canada, from this same address, Wei Wei’s wife donated $895 to the Don Valley Liberal Association.<br>While many charges were laid in Project Endgame, most charges against Wei Wei were later dropped after a high-end watch seized during the raid mysteriously disappeared while in police custody.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R3" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">4</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">OVER MY SHOULDER by MAULDIN ECONOMICS:<br>Hôm nay, tiết mục Over my Shoulder của Mauldin Economics giới thiệu quan điểm của giáo sư kinh tế Don Boudreaux: nói khu vực chế biến của Hoa Kỳ sa sút (như lý cớ gây thương chiến) là không đúng với thực tế.<br>Tôi thì nôm na cho là Trump nhìn vào kính chiếu hậu mà lao xe xuống vực - rồi vỗ ngực tự khen!<br>https://www.mauldineconomics.com/.../don-boudreaux...<br>Newsletter - May 22, 2025<br>Don Boudreaux: American Manufacturing is Doing Just Fine<br>Patrick Watson, Editor<br>Why You Should Read: Libertarian economist Don Boudreaux highlights some data many people seem to have missed.

But American manufacturing, in fact, is <br>thriving. In the twenty years from the first quarter of 2005 through the fourth quarter of 2024, real manufacturing output for the U.S. as a whole rose by 30 percent. <br>The St. Louis Fed has quarterly data on real manufacturing output also by state. Even in the rust belt, manufacturing output has increased over these twenty years. The inflation-adjusted aggregate manufacturing output of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin is today (the fourth quarter of 2024) 14 percent higher than it was in the first quarter of 2005. <br>Manufacturing is doing even better in the south. In the past twenty <br>years, the inflation-adjusted aggregate manufacturing output of <br>Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia has risen by 25 percent. <br>And in the west it’s going gangbusters. In Arizona manufacturing output is up by 114 percent, in California by 78 percent, in Oregon by 70 percent, and in Colorado by 39 percent. <br>The narrative – peddled today by pols and pundits across the political spectrum – that trade has “hollowed out” American manufacturing is the opposite of the truth. <br>Sincerely, <br>Donald J.

Last week, a third bond-rating provider lowered the US sovereign grade, projecting the nation’s debt surging to 134% of the size of the economy in 10 years, from roughly 100% today.<br>That’s a long way from the vision Trump offered in his March address to Congress, when he promised a balanced budget “in the near future.” The House bill features a bevy of new tax breaks for key political constituencies - tipped and hourly workers, car buyers and seniors. And indications from GOP senators suggest they’ll seek to pare back spending cuts to shield others from financial pain.<br>Trump’s lieutenants, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, argue that the package will boost business sentiment and unlock spending and investment. Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill also see it as the centerpiece of the party’s legislative agenda, and a counterweight to the uncertainty prompted by Trump’s haphazard tariff policies.<br>Bond market participants see something else.<br>US Bond Yields Are Well Above Average of Past Decade<br>Source: Bloomberg<br>“People are getting fed up. It’s clear that there are no adults in the room in Washington. Zero. No accountability,” said John Fath, managing partner at BTG Pactual Asset Management US LLC. “You have to ask yourself, what is it going to take? It’s going to be the price action.”<br>The action has been notable already. As Trump was putting pressure on House members to back the tax bill, the Treasury on Wednesday found tepid demand<br>at an auction of 20-year bonds. Not just Treasuries, but stocks, too, tumbled as investor concern over the US fiscal profile deepened.<br>The moves were reminiscent of Trump’s wrangle with the bond markets last month, when he blinked. In the early morning hours of April 9, Treasury yields surged as Trump’s steep retaliatory tariffs - the highest in more than a century - went into effect. While a months-long slump in equities barely fazed him, the bond market got his attention.<br>“The bond market is very tricky,” he said at the time, announcing that he was suspending most of the tariffs just hours after they went into effect. “But yeah, I saw it last night where people were getting a little queasy.”<br>If Treasuries continue to stay queasy, the higher yields not only threaten to dampen economic growth - as they translate into higher borrowing costs for everything from homes to cars - but to accelerate the government’s fiscal deterioration. As rates rise, so does the Treasury’s interest bill.<br>Read more: US Interest Burden Hits 28-Year High, Escalating Political Risk<br>“Investors are now asking themselves a very difficult question, which is, would you loan the US government money at 5% for 30 years?” said George Catrambone, head of fixed income and trading at DWS Americas. “That’s the question that we have and are facing the long end of the Treasury market.”<br>Unlike in April, Trump has not had Bessent - who has been speaking to investors in Saudi Arabia and meeting with Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Canada - hovering over his shoulder as he negotiated the House’s tax bill in the Oval Office. It was Bessent, a hedge fund veteran, who helped persuade Trump to pause the tariffs when bond markets sent distress signals.<br>Bessent last month played down the selloff in Treasuries as a function of deleveraging by some market participants.

Set at $10,000 in Trump’s 2017 tax law, Republicans from high-tax states like New York and California negotiated an increase to $40,000 as the price of their votes for the package.<br>But it was a 12-basis-point increase in 30-year Treasury yields Wednesday that seems to have provided the impetus for further spending cuts to make the bill palatable to Republican hard-liners.<br>“The bond market seems to have spoken,” said Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio, one of two Republicans to vote ‘no’ on the bill.<br>Tush Push<br>As the bond markets started to show unease this week, Trump redoubled his efforts to get the measure - formally named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act - passed in the House. He visited Capitol Hill, called lawmakers and invited holdouts to the White House.<br>With the Memorial Day holiday weekend coming up, Republicans felt an urgency to get a legislative win in a presidency characterized by a blizzard of executive orders.<br>“The bill has to be done as early as possible both because the American people deserve the money in their pockets and the changes in their lives, but it also needs to happen soon, so it can have the biggest impact,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a close Trump ally. “If we are in the middle of a Trump economic boom in 2026, we will keep the House.”<br>If Republicans fail to pass the tax package, just as tariffs create a drag on the economy, then voters could revolt in the midterms. “In 2026, the only question that will matter is: Is it working?” Gingrich added.<br>But there’s no guarantee that the uneasy truce among the party’s various factions will remain intact when the bill gets to the other side of the Capitol.<br>Senate Majority Leader John Thune - who will lead the effort to shepherd the bill through his chamber starting in June - called the ratings agency downgrades “a warning shot that we need to get serious about spending restraint.” He said this week that any final bill would need to make a meaningful dent in spending, but also boost faster economic growth.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R5" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">6</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỘT DÂN BIỂU DÂN CHỦ TỐ GIÁC SỰ GIAN TRÁ!<br>Dân biểu Dean Phillips tại Minnesota nhiều lần trực tiếp chứng kiến tình trạng sức khỏe suy sụp của Tổng thống Joe Biden nên kín đáo nêu vấn đề trong đảng từ giữa năm 2022.

(Shawn Thew-Pool/Getty Images)<br>If a relatively little-known congressman like me knew that Biden was incapable of leading the country in a second term, what does that say about the complicity of the real party bosses?<br>(By Dean Phillips - The Free Press - 05.22.25 - U.S. Politics)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>This week, journalists Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper released a bombshell book detailing even greater depths of the cover-up of former president Joe Biden’s declining health. Also this week: Biden’s spokesperson decided to announce that the former president has stage 4 prostate cancer.<br>Coincidence? I think not.<br>Numerous doctors have pointed out how unlikely it is that Biden was just diagnosed with this cancer. Biden himself even slipped up and said he had cancer in 2022. Common sense tells us that the most powerful man in the world, with access to the best healthcare in the world, would have surely known.<br>As the father of a cancer survivor, I know firsthand how painful these diagnoses are for patients and their families. But as a former Democratic congressman from Minnesota who, for years, has demanded greater transparency and accountability from my party, I am outraged to see that the important lessons from the top scandal of the 2024 election have still not been learned.<br>Constant lying and gaslighting the public about Biden’s health has cost the Democratic Party the public’s trust. Rebuilding it first requires the courage and honesty to admit to what happened.<br>In 2021, I had a front-row seat on two occasions when he addressed the House Democratic Caucus. I also spent time in close proximity to the president during two flights on Air Force One, in 2021 and 2022, where I was alarmed to see the president’s obvious decline in communication skills, gait, and leadership capacity. After the White House holiday party in December 2022, at which the president’s decline was too graphic to ignore, I was left with no doubt in my mind - Biden was unfit to serve a second term.<br>My opinion wasn’t an outlier. My congressional colleagues, like me, had eyes; behind closed doors we acknowledged the reality, lamented our party leadership’s inaction, and recognized the impending disaster awaiting us in November 2024.<br>After many of the same hushed conversations, I tried to impress a sense of urgency. I made calls to potential presidential candidates, like Illinois governor JB Pritzker and Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, to urge them to run. But they didn’t even want their names mentioned - let alone return my calls.<br>Frustrated, I went public, calling for an open primary. I implored prominent Democrats like California governor Gavin Newsom, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Vice President Kamala Harris to throw their hats in the ring. But cometh the moment - cameth nobody.<br>By the fall of 2023, I realized not only that Biden was in serious decline, but that the polling was clearly showing he couldn’t win. My party was sleepwalking into a second Trump term. So, with no one else willing to step forward - I entered the race.<br>No one puts themselves forward for president if they don’t believe they’re prepared and would do a good job - and I was no exception. But I knew I had a longer-than-long shot. More realistically, I was trying to spark a competitive primary - and at the very least to force a single, televised debate for Americans to assess the president and other candidates firsthand. I simply wanted Americans to see up close what I had seen and what the White House was trying to hide from them, and before it was too late.<br>Immediately before entering the race, I made courtesy calls to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and President Biden - but his chief of staff, Jeff Zients, took the call and made it clear I would not be speaking to Biden or anyone else in the White House.<br>I announced that I was running for president on October 27, 2023. Almost immediately, the party mechanism was activated, and I became persona non grata. The media, in particular MSNBC, where former Biden staffers wielded positions of influence—essentially deplatformed me and those supporting me. Party activists, paid and volunteer, took to social media to attack and discredit me.<br>The Democratic National Committee announced proactively that there would be no debates. State Democratic parties took steps to keep anyone not named “Biden” from being on the ballot, forcing us to file several lawsuits. In Florida, state Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried moved immediately to prevent my name from appearing on the primary ballot - literally disenfranchising millions of Florida voters by denying them the opportunity to even participate in a primary.<br>This wasn’t a fight for democracy, rather a coordinated fight against democracy - executed by a private corporation with no accountability to voters.<br>For a party ostensibly focused on protecting democracy and expanding voter rights and access, denying Democratic primary voters a single alternative to Biden was nothing short of rank hypocrisy.<br>It was one thing for my fellow Democrats to stay silent, to avoid rocking the boat. But some even subjected me to vicious, underhanded attacks. Representatives Steven Horsford and Jim Clyburn even made veiled insinuations of racism when I focused my early efforts in New Hampshire - suggesting my run was somehow an affront to black Americans.<br>Ironically, their tactics and those who chose cowardice over courage and self-preservation over principle resulted in an affront to ALL Americans.<br>It has always been my contention that Biden wasn’t behind any of these decisions. And therein lies the problem; he was surrounded by advisers and a family falsely assuring him he was popular, able, and the best candidate to take on Donald Trump.<br>And where did it get us? All those months of carefully guarding the president, prewriting his speeches, prerecording his interviews? In the end, the only unscripted, significant event President Biden did during his campaign was the July 2024 debate that was an unmitigated disaster. His entire campaign crumbled in the most humiliating way possible.<br>It’s astonishing that, for so long, Americans have both enabled and tolerated a virtual monopoly on our democracy by two private corporations: the Democratic and Republican parties. In the United States, we should never tolerate monopolies, or in this case duopolies, in any category, never mind the most important one - our democracy.<br>In real terms, reform means breaking down barriers to access ballots and the electoral system; fostering and inspiring competent, common sense candidates; and encouraging the rise of at least one compelling third party that offers competitive candidates.<br>For too many Americans, the Democratic brand is now associated with rising costs, inefficiency, tenure over talent, bureaucratic complexity, poor customer service, and the “canceling” of people and ideas that diverge from the Democratic gospel.<br>          There must be an almost obsessive focus on real-world outcomes: lowering healthcare costs, expanding housing, improving public safety and public education, and managing cities, states, and our country in a fiscally responsible manner.<br>The Democratic Party can still redeem itself. But the first step is for everyone that was aware of Biden’s condition to come clean. No more evasions. No more insistence that he was sharp when you met him. The whole truth will come out, and they would be wise to get ahead of it. If a relatively little-known congressman like me knew that Biden was incapable of leading the country in a second term, what does that say about the complicity of the real party bosses whose names we all know?<br>American voters of all political perspectives are tired of being ignored, talked down to, lied to, canceled, and expected to choose between competing versions of increasingly similar political dysfunction. For Democrats, this is an existential moment. It’s time to acknowledge their misdeeds and move on.<br>Thomas Jefferson wrote, “Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.” Indeed, trust begins with telling the truth. Not a modified truth. Not a truth that polls say people want to hear. The full truth, and nothing but the truth.<br>Protecting a president or institution at the cost of its credibility is a shortsighted and losing proposition. Democratic leaders and messengers must understand that sunlight is not our enemy, but rather the only way to earn the public’s confidence in our party.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R6" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">7</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">TRUYỀN THÔNG QUỐC DOANH VÀ QUỐC TRƯỞNG BỆNH HOẠN<br>Nền dân chủ Hoa Kỳ đang hồn nhiên lao dốc: Trong khi Hạ Viện Cộng Hòa vừa biểu quyết xong dự luật ngân sách với đa số chỉ có một phiếu thì truyền thông báo chí của đảng Dân Chủ xếp hàng bày tỏ nỗi kinh ngạc về bệnh tình của Tổng thống Joe Biden, khi đó vẫn được họ đồng ca là rất tốt đẹp. <br>Giáo sư Jonathan Turley trình bày hiện tượng ‘gia nô’ của truyền thông khi toa rập cùng chế độ Biden và đảng Dân Chủ để tìm nhiều cách che giấu sự thật trong cả năm trời:<br>https://jonathanturley.org/.../implausible-deniability.../<br>Implausible Deniability: Media Figures Continue to Spin the Coverup of Biden’s Decline Despite Crushing Polls<br>(Jonathan Turley - Uncategorized - May 22, 2025) <br>From Jake Tapper to Chuck Todd, the media in Washington has become a chorus of Claude Rains expressing how “shocked, shocked” they are about the mental diminishment of former President Joe Biden. These are some of the same journalists who attacked those who raised the issue for years. Now, polls are showing that the public is not buying the deflection. Sixty-three percent of those surveyed in the most recent poll say it is “likely” that “major media journalists were aware of Joe Biden’s declining mental condition, but covered it up.” The evidence is mounting of a coordinated campaign to conceal Biden’s demonstrable incapacity from White House staff to doctors to the media.<br>Reporters like Fox’s Peter Doocy were openly mocked by some of the same White House press corps members now expressing outrage over the cover-up. This morning Doocy recounted how he was virtually heckled in the press room when he raised questions of Biden’s diminishment.<br>Now, these reporters are insisting that they had no inkling it was this bad. No one is buying it, but it does not appear to matter.<br>Given the stories on Fox and a few outlets on the cover-up for years, it is insulting to tell the public that the degree of decline was kept from them. It is akin to describing rioting as “fiery but mostly peaceful.” The public could see the decline with their own eyes on the media outlets willing to cover the story.<br>In the meantime, the scope of the cover-up is coming to light. This week, it was disclosed that the White House devised an alternative to making Biden available to the press given his cognitive decline. They faked a town hall to take clips for the campaign to create the false image of Biden interacting with questions. The problem was that Biden could not stay focused and cogent for five minutes.<br>The footage was described as “unusable.”<br>So, in addition to hiding the President’s decline, White House and campaign officials tried to create a false image of Biden as being able to engage in the simplest interactions. One source said “the man could not speak” and showed an “inability to find words, to remember what he was saying, to stay on one train of thought. Aides would sometimes make the videos in slow motion to blur the reality of how slowly he actually walked … If he was off, editing footage in a way that cast him in the best light would require hours of work.”<br>So the same media that helped in this cover-up and attacked those pursuing the story will continue to report while claiming shock at the story.<br>“Let’s Go Brandon!” became a familiar political battle cry not just against former President Joe Biden but also against the mainstream media. It was first heard during an Oct. 2021 interview with race-car driver Brandon Brown after winning his first NASCAR Xfinity Series race. When NBC reporter Kelli Stavast’s questions were drowned out by loud and clear chants of “F— Joe Biden,” the reporter quickly and inexplicably declared, “You can hear the chants from the crowd, ‘Let’s go, Brandon!’”<br>“Let’s Go Brandon!” instantly became a type of “Yankee Doodling” of the political and media establishment.<br>The public’s response has been deafening. Readers and viewers have left mainstream media in a mass exodus. Despite falling revenues and ratings, most media outlets seem entirely clueless or, at least, unyielding. Even as media outlets plummet in revenue, editors and reporters continue to saw at the branch upon which they are sitting.<br>When Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos brought in Robert Lewis, a British media executive, to try to restore profitability and readership to the paper, he was met with a virtual mutiny. Lewis nevertheless dropped this truth bomb in the middle of the newsroom: “We are going to turn this thing around, but let’s not sugarcoat it. It needs turning around. We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff. Right. I can’t sugarcoat it anymore.”<br>The media continues to interview and write for itself. Tapper is being interviewed by the same media that joined him in actively suppressing the story.<br>Call it implausible deniability. It is enough to allow the media to continue to feign independence and objectivity. Everyone can return to the same inbred media circles and cocktail parties while blaming the White House for their lack of investigation. It is just a shrug and a spin from journalists who acted like a de facto state media.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R7" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">8</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">THÊM MỘT LỜI KHUYÊN CHO DONALD TRUMP!<br>Trên mạng Gatestone Institute, Bassam Tawil lại phải nhắc lại, rằng Iran và tay sai là lực lượng khủng bố Hamas muốn gì, để Donald Trump đừng tưởng bở và cho là mình sẽ tạo ra phép lạ! <br>https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/.../hamas-wants-to...<br>Do Not Be Fooled by Iran: What They Really Want Is to Destroy America, Israel Is Just in the Way<br>(by Bassam Tawil - Gatestone Institute - May 22, 2025 at 5:00 am)<br>*    The real nakba [catastrophe, for Palestinians] was that they started a war and lost it.

Pictured: Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (R) meets with the late Ismail Haniyeh (C), then head of the political bureau of Hamas, and Ziyad al-Nakhalah, Secretary General of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, on July 30, 2024. (Photo by the Iranian Supreme Leader&#39;s Press Office via Getty Images)<br>In many respects, Hamas, the Iran-backed terror group, has always been more forthright and honest about its goals regarding Israel than its rivals in the Palestinian Authority (PA). When one listens to leaders of the PA and the leaders of Hamas in Arabic, it is almost impossible to tell the difference between them. Their rhetoric, for instance, to vilify Israel, is identical: &quot;The Zionist Enemy&quot;, &quot;the Zionist Entity&quot;, the State of Occupation&quot;, and &quot;the Apartheid State&quot;.<br>Hamas and the PA both view the establishment of Israel as a &quot;catastrophe&quot; (nakba) and call for flooding it with millions of Palestinian &quot;refugees&quot; so that Jews become a minority to eliminate or cast out.<br>Hamas makes clear to everyone that its primary goal is to wage jihad (holy war) against Israel with the intention of replacing it with an Islamist state. The terror group&#39;s covenant proudly quotes Hassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood organization, as stating: &quot;Israel will exist and continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.&quot;<br>In mid-May, the PA and Hamas marked the 77th anniversary of &quot;Nakba Day&quot; (&quot;Catastrophe Day&quot;), a reference to the establishment of Israel in 1948.<br>Hamas, in a statement, said:<br>    &quot;The occupation [Israel] has no legitimacy or sovereignty over any part of our occupied land, and our people will continue to themselves through comprehensive resistance until the liberation of all of Palestine.&quot;<br>The terror group vowed that the &quot;resistance&quot; against Israel will continue until Palestinian refugees achieve the &quot;right of return&quot; to their former homes inside Israel.<br>Most of the so-called refugees are not real refugees. Most are descendants - now quite distant - of refugees who lost their homes when five Arab armies attacked Israel in 1948 in an attempt to prevent it from coming into existence. For Hamas and other Palestinians and Arabs, the fact that they failed to thwart the establishment of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people is a &quot;catastrophe.&quot;<br>The real nakba was that they started a war and lost it. Well, if you start a war, that is what can happen.<br>The PA and its president, Mahmoud Abbas, share Hamas&#39;s view. In a speech marking &quot;Nakba Day,&quot; Abbas, bizarrely referred to by some Westerners as a &quot;moderate leader&quot; even though he handsomely pays his people to murder Jews, described the establishment of Israel as a &quot;tragedy&quot; and as &quot;the catastrophe of catastrophes.&quot;<br>Like Hamas, Abbas called for flooding Israel with millions of Palestinian &quot;refugees&quot;:<br>    &quot;On behalf of the steadfast Palestinian people, and in the name of more than 15 million Palestinians, including seven million Palestinian refugees, we renew our pledge that we will remain adherent to our rights and will continue our legitimate struggle for freedom and independence until they are realized. Today, we commemorate not only this somber anniversary, but renew the pledge that the Nakba was not and will not be the permanent and inevitable fate of our people, and that the right of return, the right to self-determination, and the independence of the Palestinian State are steady and inalienable rights and will not be forsaken by our people.&quot;<br>Such statements by Hamas and Abbas show why the talk about a peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is, unfortunately, just a sick joke. If the Palestinians consider the establishment and existence of Israel a &quot;catastrophe&quot; and &quot;tragedy,&quot; this means that they have not – and will not – recognize Israel&#39;s right to exist.<br>By demanding the &quot;right of return&quot; for so-called refugees, Hamas and Abbas are clearly stating their intention to turn Israel into a country with an Arab Muslim majority. In this country, perhaps for a price – required Arab jizya payments are actually protection money - some Jews might be allowed to live on sufferance, as dhimmis, tolerated residents of a land conquered by Islam.<br>Those who continue to advocate for the creation of a Palestinian state need to consider that such a state would be backed, politically and militarily, by Iran and its ruling mullahs, whose declared goal is to eliminate the &quot;Zionist entity&quot; Israel, as well as the United States.<br>As Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has stated about the &quot;Little Satan&quot;: &quot;&#39;Death to Israel&#39; is not just a slogan, it is a policy.&quot; The same goes for the &quot;Great Satan&quot; and &quot;Death to America.&quot;<br>In the years leading up to its invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023, Hamas developed a concrete plan to destroy the Jewish state, in full coordination with Iran and its Lebanon-based terror proxy, Hezbollah. According to classified documents published by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, Iran was a critical player in funding Hamas&#39;s plan to destroy Israel.<br>On May 15, Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei reminded us, once again, that in his view, as he posted on X: &quot;The Zionist regime is illegitimate, and the formation of this regime was based on a false premise.&quot; He is actually repeating what he knows is the false claim that Jews have no religious, emotional or historical attachment to their homeland.<br>His post came on the occasion of &quot;Nakba Day.&quot; Many Arabs and Muslims, including Khamenei, continue to dream of the day when they would be able to destroy it. They do not conceal their support for the use of violence to achieve this goal. Furthermore, they never conceal their hatred for the &quot;Little Satan&quot; Israel, and the &quot;Great Satan&quot;, the U.S.<br>On May 4, Khamenei wrote:<br>    &quot;When we, the Muslim Ummah [nation], are detached from each other, the colonial powers – the US, the Zionist regime, and some European and non-European countries – impose their own interests over the interests of other nations.&quot;<br>Iran&#39;s supreme leader is telling Arabs and Muslims that they must unite to confront not only Israel, but also the US and other non-Muslims.<br>In another post on May 15, Khamenei wrote:<br>    &quot;Palestinian political, military and cultural fight should continue until those [Jews] who have usurped Palestine submit to the vote of the Palestinian nation.&quot;<br>For Iran&#39;s mullahs, the &quot;military fight&quot; means unleashing terrorism against Israel by their Palestinian, Lebanese, and Yemeni terror proxies: Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.<br>In the context of his anti-US rhetoric and policy, Khamenei recently scoffed at US President Donald J. Trump&#39;s visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates and his talk about achieving peace and prosperity. &quot;Trump said he wants to use power for peace,&quot; Khamenei wrote on May 17:<br>    &quot;Some of the remarks made during the US President&#39;s trip to the region aren&#39;t even worth a response at all. The level of those remarks is so low that they are a source of shame for the American nation.&quot;<br>He later added:<br>    &quot;Trump said he wants to use power for peace. He&#39;s lying.&quot;<br>The Trump administration should beware of countries where the mouth says one thing but the legs do the opposite. Believe the legs. The Iranians and Palestinians have not given up their dream of eliminating Israel and America.<br>The Trump administration also should realize that Palestinian and Iranian leaders tell Westerners one thing - what they like to hear - in English, while addressing their people with completely different messages in Arabic and Farsi. Believe the Arabic and Farsi.<br>Mahmoud Abbas has long been telling Westerners about his desire to make peace and establish a Palestinian state next to Israel; at the same time, he keeps calling for Israel&#39;s destruction.<br>Iran&#39;s leaders do the same thing. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reassures Americans that &quot;We are not seeking war, we favor negotiation and dialogue.&quot; Meanwhile, Khamenei calls for the elimination of the &quot;Zionist regime&quot; and endorses &quot;Death to America.&quot;<br>The Palestinians and Iran&#39;s mullahs believe that Americans and most Westerners are gullible enough to unreservedly swallow any lie – they so often have in the past.<br>It is time for the Trump administration and other Westerners to see that the Palestinians and the Iranian regime do not want Israel or America in the Middle East - period - and are prepared to do anything to achieve this goal, including with nuclear weapons.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R8" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">9</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/22/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">ÔI LUẬT SƯ NẶC NÔ: EM TỒ VÀO MẶT CHÚNG!<br>Khi giới thiệu Ann Coulter là luật sư, ít ai rõ nếu không theo dõi từ vài chục năm.

But now, the fringe theory that smoking is bad for your health is being promoted by an obscure German dictator named Adolf Hitler - the same dictator who would later preside over the murder of 6 million Jews.<br>Maybe liberals have been doing this forever and I only recently noticed, but there&#39;s been a rash of supposedly serious news outlets trying to discredit conservative arguments by attributing the argument to the most embarrassing right-winger they can find.<br>Today&#39;s Weakest Link trick comes from the Times&#39; Abbie VanSickle, who claims John Eastman is the originator of the idea that the 14th Amendment is about freed slaves, not illegal aliens. <br>In case you&#39;re not sure what to think of Eastman, VanSickle quickly identifies him as &quot;an obscure California law professor... [who provided] Mr. Trump with legal arguments he used to try to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.” <br>Further proving that this was Eastman’s idea all along, there&#39;s an 8-by-10-inch photo of him accompanying VanSickle&#39;s story, titled, &quot;At Supreme Court, a Once-Fringe Birthright Citizenship Theory Takes the Spotlight.&quot;<br>Upon publication of VanSickle&#39;s article, every journalist on TV became an expert on the issue, regurgitating her preposterous claim that Eastman is the brains behind the idea - oh, and by the way, this is the guy who tried to overturn the 2020 election.<br>So I guess you don&#39;t have to know anything more!I&#39;m not comparing Eastman to Hitler, except in the sense that Hitler was not the first person to come up with the idea that smoking is bad for your health - just as Eastman is not the first person to argue that the 14th Amendment has nothing to do with anchor babies. Why falsely identify him as the originator of that view (which happens to be correct) unless you&#39;re trying to discredit the argument without ever having to explain it, much less refute it?<br>This is like ad hominem by proxy. You find someone who&#39;s easy to attack, then designate that person as the sole purveyor of an argument you don&#39;t like.But just to be extra sure that Eastman is the inventor of the &quot;wacky idea&quot; that the 14th Amendment has nothing to do with illegal immigrants, VanSickle checked with Eastman himself. And guess what? He&#39;s delighted to claim full credit. (So in addition to being &quot;obscure,&quot; Eastman is also what&#39;s known as &quot;a delusional narcissist.&quot;) <br>E.g.:-- &quot;Mr. Eastman said that the president did not directly consult him about the birthright citizenship order but that several of his friends ... &#39;knew that my scholarship was kind of at the forefront of this.’”- &quot;Mr. Eastman said Mr. Trump was &#39;likely&#39; referring to him [when he cited many lawyers who agreed with him on anchor babies].&quot; <br>Is this really how the Times determines authorship? Ask the person claiming credit: Tell the truth. Is this your idea? (Glad they weren&#39;t on the Claudine Gay plagiarism investigation.) According to VanSickle, Eastman first made the argument in a 2004 amicus brief to the Supreme Court. The case had nothing to do with anchor babies, and Eastman&#39;s brief was not read by the court - much less by Donald Trump - but let&#39;s take 2004 as our marker. Here are just a few people whose scholarship on the issue far preceded Eastman&#39;s.<br>In 1985, Yale professors Peter Schuck and Rogers Smith - no slouches - published a book, &quot;Citizenship Without Consent: Illegal Aliens in the American Policy,” making this inarguable point: &quot;The parents of [illegals] are, by definition, individuals whose presence within the jurisdiction of the United States is prohibited by law and to whom the society has explicitly and self-consciously decided to deny membership. And if the society has refused to consent to their membership, it can hardly be said to have consented to that of their children who happen to be born while their parents are here in violation of American law.&quot;<br>Schuck and Smith simply take it for granted that anchor babies are not mandated by the 14th Amendment. They write that the debates &quot;establish that the framers of the Citizenship Clause had no intention of establishing a universal rule of birthright citizenship.&quot; <br>(In VanSickle&#39;s telling, this description of the debates doesn&#39;t appear in the Yale professors’ 1985 book: It&#39;s just a &quot;claim&quot; made by Eastman.)<br>In the summer of 1996, Dan Stein and John Bauer published an article in the Stanford Law &amp; Policy Review, also arguing that the Constitution does not mandate anchor babies: “Interpreting the 14th Amendment: Automatic Citizenship for Children of Illegal Immigrants?”<br>Then, in 2003, the late Richard Posner, 7th Circuit Appellate judge, wrote a concurring opinion in Oforji v. Ashcroft for the express purpose of demanding that Congress stop “awarding citizenship to everyone born in the United States.” He said he doubted that this was the meaning of the 14th Amendment and pleaded with Congress to pass a law and “put an end to the nonsense.” <br>Say you&#39;re a reporter for the Newspaper of Record, trying to fairly summarize the debate over the 14th Amendment and anchor babies. Do you cite Posner, the most-cited federal judge, regularly called a &quot;genius&quot; by his peers - including the late Justice Antonin Scalia - and one of the 100 judges listed in &quot;Great American Judges: An Encyclopedia&quot;? Two Yale professors? A Stanford legal journal? Or do you cite a disbarred, debunked &quot;obscure California law professor&quot; who helped Trump try to overturn the 2020 election? <br>The choice is obvious.

(and beyond), providing the inside track on both the overhyped and overlooked events of the week.<br>Who to Blame for the Biden Coverup<br>The code of silence that for years shut down any discussion of Joe Biden’s mental and physical decline was in some ways a collective-action failure - Democrats and the press were so invested in stopping Donald Trump and winning the election that they neglected truth and the country. But with those battles lost, the publication of “Original Sin” - the new Biden tell-all from Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper that hit the stands Tuesday - and Biden’s Sunday cancer diagnosis, seemed to open floodgates. Suddenly, everyone has a story about Biden’s incapacities, and suddenly people are more willing to name names.<br>The lucky Democrats are those who had limited contact with Biden, and who are now excusing their prior claims of his good health on situational grounds. As in: ”Well, the few times I was with him, he was fine.” And there are plenty of these, since “Original Sin” confirms that as time went by, Biden’s handlers walled off the president. But we are at least now hearing the name of the handlers who worked to keep Biden’s frailties secret, and anecdotes of other players who were clearly presented evidence there was a problem, yet did nothing. Let’s take stock:<br>1/    Jill Biden: The president’s wife wasn’t shy about her ambition to occupy the White House a full eight years. Interviewed by the New Yorker’s David Remnick, author Thompson recounts: “As someone put it within the family: All Presidents run for two terms. The First Lady’s team was already plotting ‘What are we going to do in a second term?’ very, very early on.” He says that Mrs. Biden was viewed as the head “protector” and that Biden aides described her “as one of the most powerful First Ladies in American history.” Thompson reported last summer that Mrs. Biden and her top aide, Anthony Bernal, went so far as to separate the president from the White House residence staff, blocking butlers and other household workers from interacting with Joe. Family members are of course those most likely to see mental decline and to recognize it; the former first lady even today insists her husband is fine.<br>2/    The aides: A picture is forming of that handful of aides trusted by the Biden family to act as intermediaries between Biden and the world, to limit his exposure, and to squelch any questions about his health. They included Bernal, Ron Klain (chief of staff until 2023), Bruce Reed and Annie Tomasini (deputy chiefs of staff), Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti (advisers), and national-security officials Jake Sullivan and Antony Blinken. A quote from a Biden cabinet secretary in “Original Sin”: “I’ve never seen a situation like this before, with so few people having so much power. They would make huge economic decisions without calling [Treasury] secretary [ Janet] Yellen.” Evidence is meanwhile surfacing that these aides didn’t just hide Biden from the public; they hid information from Biden, including the reality of just how many elected Democrats wanted him out.<br>3/    The doctors: In particular, Kevin O’Connor, who became Biden’s personal physician in 2009, helped with Beau Biden’s cancer care, and was tapped to become physician to the president in 2021. O’Connor, who is described as close with the Biden family, consistently pronounced Biden “fit for duty” - though he rarely took or answered questions. Reporting shows that O’Connor also continued to insist that Biden did not need a cognitive test, despite many doctors administering regular cognitive exams when their patients hit their 60s (Biden was inaugurated at 78). From the Thompson interview with Remnick: “Biden’s personal physician said, ‘Well, I see him every day. And the cognitive exam is made for physicians who only see their patients every several months. And if you doubt that he is cognitively capable - listen, he is doing the job.’” If O’Connor did see him every day, why didn’t he report what everyone else is now admitting? Add in the news that the president’s medical team failed to diagnose Biden’s metastatic cancer, which is advanced enough to have started years ago.<br>4/   The Cabinet: The book, as well as the recent release of the audio of former special counsel Robert Hur’s interview with Biden, further point to officials who should have understood there was a problem. “Original Sin” recounts that cabinet members were disturbed that the few cabinet meetings that occurred were almost entirely stage-managed, with scripts, so that Biden would look in command. Why did nobody say anything? And then there’s former Attorney General Merrick Garland, who was in possession of those hours of Hur audio recordings—and who refused to release them to the GOP House. Garland testified to the House last year that he hadn’t listened to the audio when he refused to release it. Why not? Republicans wanted the tapes to help judge Biden’s mental fitness. Had these cabinet members made a point of finding out Biden’s true state, they might have been expected to act. Nobody wanted to know.<br>5/   The press: “Original Sin” somehow manages to skip over the press’s own omertà when it came to Biden’s failing health. Tapper, one of the authors, was among those who berated anyone who questioned Biden’s fitness for office. The excuse: No one was willing to talk until after the election. But hard stories are hard for a reason, and few in the press made this a cause until late in Biden’s term.<br>Democrats now argue we should ignore the coverup because it’s old news; they lost, let’s move on. But let’s not forget that they had every intention of using it to win. And had they pulled it off, the country could at this moment be coping with a constitutional crisis (were Biden incapacitated and his inner cabal unwilling to give up power), or saddled with Kamala Harris if Biden stepped down. The country deserves the truth, in part to consider ways to guard against a repeat.<br>‘The Apprentice,’ Federal Edition<br>The administration on Friday officially asked the Supreme Court to reaffirm Trump’s power to issue his catchphrase - “you’re fired” -only this time to thousands of federal workers. The case is one of the more high-profile Trump-related issues destined for the high court, which could clarify the extent of a president’s power to manage the executive-branch workforce.<br>Solicitor General D. John Sauer’s emergency application asks the Supremes to lift a lower-court block on the administration’s efforts to fire federal workers across 17 agencies. California district court judge Susan Illston recently issued a sweeping restraining order, barring a Trump executive order that put into motion some 40 “reduction in force” (RIF) efforts across the government. Federal unions, nonprofits and local governments all sued, while more than 20 states have also filed amicus briefs supporting the workers. Illston ruled the workers were likely to win, on grounds that Trump cannot “engage in large-scale overhauls of federal agencies” without the approval of Congress.<br>Sauer’s application disagrees, claiming Congress has long “recognized the Executive Branch’s authority to carry out reductions in its workforce as the need arises,” and points to Bill Clinton’s order in 1993 that all federal agencies with more than 100 employees “eliminate not less than 4 percent of [their] civilian personnel positions” within three years. The solicitor general points out that “RIFs are indisputably permitted by federal law” and must be challenged in special administrative or judicial settings as defined by civil-service laws. He reminds the Supreme Court that only last month it lifted a stay on the administration’s efforts to fire probationary workers in six cabinet departments, and argues it should do the same here, as Illston’s order is even more expansive.<br>That’s also the catch. The sheer depth of the Trump cuts is what critics argue make the legal questions in this case different. Illston in her opinion focuses on several examples of Trump RIFs that the plaintiffs claim are so large as to reduce or end the capacity to administer certain programs. The judge claims that since Congress created these programs, it must have a role in deciding if they are altered or continued. Meaning the case may to some extent touch on bigger questions of presidential authority.<br>In any event, the Supremes won’t be deciding the merits now - simply whether to allow the administration to proceed until the case can be litigated in full. But their handling of the emergency application could provide hints as to future thinking.<br>The Senate Decides to Run the Senate<br>Majority Leader John Thune on Tuesday announced the Senate will push ahead this week with a vote to kill Biden waivers that allowed California (and other states) to establish aggressive electric-vehicle mandates that threaten to kill off the internal-combustion engine. The House already used the Congressional Review Act to kill the waivers in early May, but the Senate Republican caucus has been more hesitant.<br>Why? Because the Government Accountability Office - the nonpartisan agency that helps Congress fulfill its legislative duties - decided that the Biden waivers didn’t official count as a “rule” and thus wasn’t subject to the CRA, even though Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin submitted them as such. The Senate parliamentarian seconded the GAO’s opinion. Democrats are howling that Republicans are taking an unprecedented action that will demolish important Senate safeguards, an accusation that has made some Republicans nervous about moving ahead.<br>The better read: It’s the GAO that is acting in unprecedented fashion, given its longtime position that all actions an agency submits to Congress are to be treated as rules. The question is why it reversed itself for this very high-profile Biden rule. Moreover, GAO has no statutory role under CRA. As an unelected bureaucracy, it fulfills an informal, advisory role. It has historically said that its opinion counts only when agencies don’t submit actions to Congress that should be considered rules. (This excellent analysis goes through the legal and precedent problems with GAO’s opinion, while Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso lays out a strong argument for proceeding here.) As Republicans note, the weirdness of GAO’s move makes the likelihood of a repeat situation unlikely - knocking down Democratic claims that this is the beginning of the end of Senate safeguards.<br>The GAO oddity if anything heightens the need for Republicans to hold the vote. Yes, it is important to give deference to the (sometimes) neutral gatekeepers. But when those bureaucracies start making up things as they go, the Senate needs to reassure the public that it is the Senate still in charge.<br>BY THE NUMBERS:<br>[18] “Important” countries that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent now expects the U.S. to do trade deals with in its 90-day pause in tariffs (rather than the original target of 90 countries in 90 days).

Lee signed legislation in February creating the state’s first-ever school-choice program, and the State Board of Education moved quickly to get the program running for the upcoming year. The state will award 20,000 scholarships for the 2025-26 school year, to be used at some 200 participating private schools.</td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R10" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">11</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/21/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">OVER MY SHOULDER CỦA MAULDIN ECONOMICS<br>Hôm nay John Mauldin và Patrick Watson tóm lược năm lãnh vực chúng ta nên chú ý.

Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should . . . EAT THE TARIFFS, and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!”<br>Item two: “After causing catastrophic inflation, Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls . . . Her plan is very dangerous because it may sound good politically... This is Communist; this is Marxist; this is fascist.”<br>If you guessed that both are statements by Donald Trump, you have broken the code on the bizarro world of the President’s second-term economic policies. Last year he blasted Kamala Harris’s proposal for price controls on groceries. But now he is attacking Walmart for warning that it will have to raises prices in the wake of Mr. Trump’s tariffs.<br>Mr. Trump’s flip-flop on price controls is a rebuttal of his own previous tariff claims. For months he’s said that foreign producers pay the full cost of tariffs. But now he’s admitting that Walmart, an American retailer, will have to eat some of the costs or pass them on to Americans.<br>Despite his business background, Mr. Trump doesn’t know much about retail. Walmart’s net profit margin is below 3%, so it doesn’t have much room to absorb the higher costs caused by tariffs. Retail competition is intense, and Walmart’s longtime comparative advantage has been lower prices. [Đúng rồi, nhắc giáo chủ về kế toán may ra ngài bớt nói nhảm!]<br>Mr. President is telling a company how to run its business, along with a vague, implicit threat of retribution. Marxist? How would Mr. Trump react if Congress told him how much his family could charge for a Mar-a-Lago fee?<br>Mr. Trump is trying to duck the political fallout for his misguided tariff policy by blaming everyone else.

Its coffers bled dry by a staggering debt that ranks second only to New York City. That debt is largely driven by the iron grip of powerful unions that have long dictated the city’s political pulse.

So the hole keeps getting bigger. They keep giving out more benefits in order to buy off the unions and get votes. So you’ve got this kind of marriage between the politicians and the unions to take care of each other, and it’s the ordinary people who are left out having to pay bigger and bigger taxes.<br>Right now, Chicago’s pension funds are a shocking $53 billion short.

November 18, 2024. AP/Ohad Zwigenberg<br>ALAN DERSHOWITZ<br>(By ALAN DERSHOWITZ - NY Sun - May. 21, 2025 06:20 AM ET)<br>Updated: May. 21, 2025 07:27 AM ET<br>There can be little doubt that over the last quarter of a century Israeli voters have moved to the center from the left, and now to the right. The same is true, though to a somewhat lesser degree, of Israeli supporters in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and other countries with significant Jewish populations. The primary reason is obvious: The left has turned against Israel and against its supporters.<br>Jews have traditionally been on the left side of politics both in Israel and in the diaspora. When Israel was first established, it had widespread support among the left, even among the extreme left. At its founding, Israel was a socialist democracy surrounded by reactionary Arab dictatorships.<br>Not surprisingly, the Soviet Union supported its establishment in 1948, and Czechoslovakia even supplied it with arms to defend itself against invading Arab nations. This all changed in the 1960s when the Soviet Union decided to abandon left-wing Israel and support the right-wing Arab states that were seeking Israel’s destruction.<br>The reason for this switch was purely power politics: The undemocratic Arab states were rich in natural resources, especially oil and gas; they also had geographical advantages such as the Suez Canal. Israel on the other hand was an agrarian socialist state with few natural or geographic resources; they exported Jaffa oranges and mud from the Dead Sea.<br>When the Soviet Union turned against Israel and in favor of Arab Tyrannies, the European and American hard-left fell in line. Euro-communist parties followed the lead of the Soviet Union, as did the American Communist party. Most moderate leftists continued to support Israel, especially during the Six Day War in 1967.<br>Israeli voters generally continued to support left-wing candidates until 1977, when Menachem Begin won a surprising victory. Since that time the trend among Israeli voters has been slightly right, though left-of-center candidates such as Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak won elections in 1992 and 1999.<br>Then, two developments began to move Israeli voters discernibly to the right. The first was the immigration of hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews into Israel. These Jews had experienced discrimination and persecution from Communist regimes throughout the Soviet Union. Not surprisingly, they did not trust the left. These new immigrants asserted themselves politically and formed alliances primarily with center-right and right-wing parties.<br>Israel is a vibrant and dynamic democracy, where outcomes depend on the experiences, history, and ideology of the voters. So the influx of anti-Communist Soviet Jews had an immediate impact on Israeli politics, moving it to the right.<br>The second reason for the rightward movement by Israeli voters is the Arab rejectionism of Israeli peace offers. The most striking was the 2000-2001 peace initiative by a liberal prime minister, Mr. Barak, and President Clinton. Here is the way Clinton characterized the offer:<br>“[The] peace deal that we had worked out… would have given the Palestinians a state in 96% of the West Bank and 4% of Israel, and they got to choose where the 4% of Israel was. So they would have the effect of the same land of all the West Bank. They would have a capital in east Jerusalem…<br>“All this was offered including… a capital in east Jerusalem and two of the four quadrants of the old city of Jerusalem confirmed by the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barack and his cabinet, and they said no, and I think part of it is that Hamas did not care about a homeland for the Palestinians. They wanted to kill Israelis and make Israel uninhabitable.”<br>This rejection of a two-state solution was accompanied by an intifada in which thousands of Israeli and Palestinian civilians were killed. This led to the weakening of the Israeli left and the strengthening of the right. Many centrist Israeli voters grew frustrated with the failed efforts of the “peace camp” to achieve a two-state solution through negotiation and compromise. Israelis began to believe that terrorism could be prevented and/or deterred only through military actions.<br>Then came Hamas. In 2005, Israel’s conservative prime minister, Ariel Sharon, unilaterally ended Israel’s occupation of Gaza and turned Israeli equipment over to Palestinian leaders in an effort to create a viable Palestinian enclave - Singapore on the Mediterranean. Hamas then proceeded to murder Palestinian authority leaders and take over the Gaza Strip in an unlawful coup. <br>Hamas then proceeded to fire rockets into Israel for years.<br>This belligerency culminated in the October 7 massacres and kidnappings. The victims were primarily Israeli leftists and peaceniks who are active in efforts to bring about a two-state solution. Not surprisingly, October 7 weakened the left and strengthened the right.<br>The reaction of the left to October 7, and the positive support given by many to the Hamas barbarism, moved many Jews out of their traditional left-wing base and toward a more conservative perspective.<br>The above analysis is not intended either to justify or criticize this obvious right-ward movement among many Israelis and their supporters around the world. It is intended to explain a phenomenon that many seem not to understand. It should be expected that when the left turns against a nation and its supporters and the right turns toward them, there will be a change in attitudes and voting patterns. <br>Many people somehow believe, however, that Israelis and Jews should be different: They should continue to support the left even though the left has abandoned them. To expect Israelis and Jews to act against their interest, though, is to impose an unacceptable double standard.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R15" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">16</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">MỘT BÀI ĐIỂM SÁCH CÔNG PHU:<br> Trên Substack riêng (tên là LONG WALLS - Geopolitics, Grand Strategy, Economic Statecraft, Technology, Policy, and the defense of the West), hôm nay tiến sĩ Leonard Hochberg điểm cuốn sách của giáo sư Hal Brands thuộc Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies: “THE EURASIAN CENTURY Hot Wars, Cold Wars, and the Making of the Modern World” do nhà W.

W. Norton &amp; Company, 2025)<br> OVERVIEW<br> Dr. Hal Brands, a professor of American history and foreign policy at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, has written a useful and significant study of the international system from 1900 through the first quarter of the 21st century. The volume may be divided into three interrelated themes.<br> First, Brands rapidly traces the history of democratic versus autocratic geopolitical thought for the general reader. Halford Mackinder, Alfred Thayer Mahan, and Nicholas Spykman - the defenders of Western democracies - and Major General Karl Haushofer and Aleksandr Dugin - the proponents of Eurasian autocracies - each receive an appropriate mention. However, it is the work of Halford Mackinder that receives pride of place for having predicted the essential feature of the hot and cold wars of the modern world: In short, the offshore maritime powers of Great Britain, and later the United States, sought to maintain the balance of power in Eurasia. Why? To ensure that no one power or alliance of land-based powers would manage to unify Eurasia, thereby gaining undisputed access to the manpower and resources of that supercontinent. Such access would allow a unified Eurasia to build fleets that could threaten the thalassocracies of Great Britain and the U.S.<br> The second theme, a historical treatment of the hot wars and cold wars that erupted across Eurasia since the dawn of the twentieth century, comprises the bulk of Brand’s book. Approximately 40 pages is devoted to the origins, course, and consequences of World War I, World War II, the Cold War between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S., and the second Cold War between the P.R.C. and the U.S. These four chapters are strategic histories, as Colin Gray would have characterized them, rather than general histories of each period. The author elaborates the grand strategies of the protagonists, discusses military campaigns, evaluates the strategic dilemmas that decision makers attempted to resolve during their respective conflicts, and considers the consequences, intended and otherwise, of defeat or victory.<br> Third, Brands ends his book with policy recommendations. He draws these recommendations from how Great Britain and the United States managed to emerge victorious in the first three conflicts. The maritime powers frequently delayed addressing the dangers presented by the Eurasian autocracies - their quest for more territory, more manpower, more resources, more power - until it was almost too late. Brands suggests it is critical to maintain strong alliances to contain and deter such adversaries. Furthermore, military capability must be cultivated to issue timely and credible threats. The goal: keep Eurasia internally divided.<br> In effect, our current danger grew out of the fact that the United States assumed that, after the Cold War, liberal democracy was the wave of the future. However, the diffusion of our values and institutions depended not merely on the prestige that victory over the U.S.S.R. conferred on the United States, but more significantly on the maintenance of military capability. Reliance on a “rules based international order” is woefully insufficient in maintaining the hard power needed to guarantee national security. Furthermore, post-cold war hegemonic power of the United States prompted China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, despite their ideological differences, to eventually team up.[1] These revisionist powers seek to make the world safe for empire, their empires. Grey zone conflicts, proxy wars, and the threat of war have occurred across the Eurasian rimland.<br> CARTOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATIONS OF STRATEGIC HISTORY<br> There is much to recommend this book, not the least of which is the reintroduction of classical geopolitical theory to the general reader. Brands deserves applause for having done so as a way of making sense of our current situation. Many faculty will adopt this book as a secondary reading in advanced courses in the fields of American foreign policy, strategy, and national security. <br> Nevertheless, there is one troubling and obvious oversight that should be highlighted: The general reader and the student will search in vain for maps drawn specifically to highlight classical geopolitical thought and Brands’ geohistorical arguments. A historical atlas will need to be purchased and carefully interpreted to get the most out of The Eurasian Century.<br> Furthermore, while one should never judge a book by its cover, perhaps it is legitimate to judge a cover by the themes presented in a book. The cover of Brands’ book depicts three Eurasian maps along a horizontal timeline, ~1890 to ~2030. In the first, overlaid on the timeline from ~1890 to 1930-1945, Central and Western Europe are highlighted, presumably as the Eurasian geopolitical cockpit of the period; in the third, 1978-1992 to ~2030, China, Taiwan, and the territories along the southern and western borders of China are highlighted as the new flashpoint. But what about the map of Eurasia that corresponds to the period 1930-1945 through 1978-1992?<br> Given the thesis of the book, a reader might expect to see the territory of the U.S.S.R. and the Warsaw Pact highlighted - that is the power that threatened the stability of Eurasia during the Cold War. Instead, the territory of the Indian subcontinent (including Pakistan and Bangladesh) is highlighted! What? How did this cartographic error occur? Publishers, not authors, frequently have control over what book covers depict; yet, given this egregious mistake, did the publisher miss the point of the book? Why didn’t the author demand that the central map be changed to reflect the Soviet threat?<br> Maps in a book about geopolitics do not merely adorn the argument. They should, at the very least, depict the locations mentioned in the text, saving the reader from having to constantly consult a historical atlas. However, to be truly effective, maps should offer a visual display of strategic concepts, highlight theoretically relevant locations where military conflicts begin, intensify, and are resolved, and indicate the relationship of process to critical locations, such as international commerce to maritime chokepoints.[2]<br> GEOGRAPHY, EURASIA, AND MACKINDER’S HEARTLAND THESIS<br> The cartography on the cover is indicative of some deeper issues. Let’s start with the basics. Geographers frequently characterize regions as either “uniform” in nature or “functional.” A uniform region is characterized by its one essential and significant characteristic - for instance, an “industrial” region - to enable a comparison with another, different uniform region - such as an “agricultural” region. Brands frequently deploys “Eurasia” as a “uniform” region.[3] Why?<br> Brands may believe that the China-Russia-Iran-North Korea proto-alliance gives rise to a politically uniform region in which autocracy is the most salient characteristic. Or he may believe that the Trans-Siberian Railroad, when connected to the various transportation projects promoted by China under the Belt and Road and other infrastructure initiatives, has produced or will soon produce a single economic unit in Eurasia. Or he may have emphasized Europe and Asia as a unified source of danger to the United States as distinct from the China challenge in the Indo-Pacific region.[4] Geography is often gerrymandered for political purposes. These three points are mere speculation.<br> A fourth possibility is that Brands is simplifying his geographic terminology to appeal to an audience of general readers that, in the words of the old rock and roll song, “don’t know much about geography…” Turning to the text, Brands suggests that Mackinder’s stunning 1904 presentation on “The Geographical Pivot of History”[5] combined vague abstraction, meandering narration, distant history, and mountains of geographical detail. The talk featured a long, if graceful, discussion of rivers, steppes, peaks and monsoon lands; it was full of concepts (“Pivot Area,” “Inner Crescent,” “Outer Crescent”) that then probably seemed obscure.[6]<br> Mackinder was addressing an audience of geographers and imperial policy makers, most of whom knew where the Ural Mountains, Manchuria, the Volga River, etc. were to be found. Did Mackinder depict his “obscure” concepts with maps? According to Dr. Brian Blouet, Mackinder’s biographer, Mackinder “illustrated” his talk, probably to identify the location where his concepts applied to Eurasian and world history.[7] In the published version of “The Geographical Pivot of History,” Mackinder deployed five figures, the fifth of which explicitly showed the locations of these supposedly “obscure” concepts.[8]<br> So, how does Hal Brands define Eurasia? Much depends on this definition, as “Eurasia” is not visualized in a map, even though it is his key unit of geographic analysis.<br> As the name implies, Eurasia consists of the combined expanse of those two Old World continents of the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia. It includes the outlying islands of those continents, which are closely connected to them by Eurasia’s marginal seas, as well as North Africa, which is thoroughly linked to Europe by the Mediterranean as it is blocked from the rest of Africa by the Sahara. Eurasia thus runs from littoral Asia in the East to the Iberian Peninsula and the British Isles in the West, from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Indian Ocean in the south. This “world island,” as geographer Halford Mackinder called it, is a space unlike any other.[9]<br> All but the last sentence in this characterization is correct.<br> In his masterpiece Democratic Ideals and Reality,[10] Mackinder defines the “world-island” as comprised of six (uniform) subregions: (1) the Sahara, (2) the Southern Heartland,[11] south of sub-Saharan Africa, (3) Arabia, (4) the Monsoon Coastlands (of India, Southwest Asia, and China), (5) the “European Coastland,” and finally - Mackinder’s particular contribution to our understanding of geopolitics of the 20th and the first quarter of the 21st century - (6) the “Heartland.” Thus, despite Brands’ assertion that the boundaries of the “world-island” are conterminous with Eurasia, Mackinder includes in the world-island two subregions that fall outside of Eurasia.[12] This may seem to be a mere geographical technicality, but details matter, especially when it comes to what constitutes Brands’ key unit of analysis, Eurasia, which he argues is a regional “prize without equal: it is the strategic center of the world.”[13]<br> Halford Mackinder, when characterizing the world-island, did so as a “functional” region, that is, one in which the humans living in the subregions interacted with one another economically, socially, and militarily. At the strategic center of the world-island is the Geographic Pivot, occupied by Tsarist Russia, and later termed the Eurasian Heartland. In 1904 Mackinder asked,<br> Is not the pivot region of the world&#39;s politics that vast area of Euro-Asia which is inaccessible to ships, but in antiquity lay open to the horse-riding nomads, and is to-day about to be covered with a network of railways? There have been and are here the conditions of a mobility of military and economic power of a far-reaching and yet limited character. Russia replaces the Mongol Empire. Her pressure on Finland, on Scandinavia, on Poland, on Turkey, on Persia, on India, and on China, replaces the centrifugal raids of the steppemen [sic]. In the world at large she occupies the central strategical position held by Germany in Europe. She can strike on all sides and be struck from all sides, save the north. The full development of her modern railway mobility is merely a matter of time.[14]<br> Russia, as the “Pivot” or Heartland power, exerts pressure on the lands along its borders; however, as the Heartland power, it was relatively immune from the influence of maritime power due to rivers flowing to inland seas or the Arctic, and the way the polar ice cap limited the movement of shipping. With the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, Russia acquired not merely the means to access virgin agricultural land and new mineral resources, but also internal lines of communication, travel, and transport - factors essential for rapidly moving and deploying military force. For Mackinder, the Tsarist regime threatened to overturn the balance of power in Europe and beyond by suddenly transforming the territory of the Eurasian Heartland into an economically modern and politically unified new environment.<br> Hal Brands, in emphasizing Eurasia as his unit of geographic analysis, rarely mentions Mackinder’s Heartland thesis. Surprisingly, The Eurasian Century fails to note the Heartland in the index - either as a separate term or under Mackinder’s name. Yet, in one critical passage, Brands mentions the Heartland. He quotes, in an abbreviated fashion, Mackinder’s geopolitical catechism: “Who rules the Heartland rules the World-Island; whoever rules the World-Island commands the World.”[15] Yet here too, Brands misses Mackinder’s deeper point, which is suggested by the full quote from Democratic Ideals and Reality:<br> Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland:<br> Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island:<br> Who rules the World-Island commands the World.[16]<br> Why does East Europe loom so large in Mackinder’s formulation in Democratic Ideals and Reality? First, East Europe was the land over which Germanic and Slavic peoples competed - one of the fundamental causes of World War I for Mackinder. Second, East Europe was (and remains) the gateway to the Heartland. The Northern European plain and the Danube Basin provide the two major land-based invasion routes into the Heartland. Third, in Democratic Ideals and Reality, Mackinder reformulated the Heartland thesis from a geographic region into a strategic region, where the great European autocratic powers threaten the lands along the littorals of the Baltic and Black seas.[17]<br> Finally, Mackinder envisioned Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Great Bohemia, Hungary, Great Rumania, Bulgaria, Great Serbia, and Greece[18] as: (1) a make weight against the revival of German power, (2) a bulwark, keeping the post-war Russian Communist regime outside of Europe, and (3) the foundation for a restored European balance of power. One curiosity: although Ukraine is not explicitly mentioned in the text, it does appear (without territorial boundaries) on Mackinder’s map depicting Eastern Europe.[19] In short, the Wilsonian ideals of national self-determination of the East European states and collective security through the League of Nations needed to be brought into alignment with the realities of power. In Mackinder’s vision, these newly independent nations would align with France and Great Britain, thereby putting the League on a sound footing and restoring a balance of power to Europe.<br> According to Brands, “For Mackinder, then the most critical feature of the peace was not the League of Nations. It was the creation of a cordon sanitaire between Russia and Germany - a ‘tier of independent states’ that, in defending themselves, would keep Eurasia in balance.”[20] This interpretation is correct, but not quite good enough. For Mackinder, the independent states of East Europe, once allied with the democratic and maritime powers of Western Europe, would restore the balance of power and thereby stabilize the League as a mechanism for collective security.<br> Mackinder was not a modern “realist.”[21] He recognized that ideals, such as liberty, equality, and nationalism, had historically become institutionalized as features of reality.[22] Even collective security was on the verge of becoming institutionalized when Mackinder wrote. Such ideals needed to be considered when formulating a foreign policy designed to restructure the international order in the aftermath of World War I. Therefore, the fundamental issue for Mackinder wasn’t ideals versus the reality of power in the international arena; instead, it was how to reconcile democratic ideals with the reality of power. The title of Mackinder book was not Democratic Ideals or Reality.<br> Mackinder’s Democratic Ideals and Realty was written in recognition that post-World War I democratic populations were being carried away by an overly optimistic idea of what collective security could accomplish. A correction was needed; Mackinder supplied it by imagining a new geopolitical order that mobilized many of the hitherto submerged ethnic groups of the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and German empires as autonomous nation-states.[23]<br> Brands alludes to the importance of East Europe when he evaluates the geopolitical ideas of Major General Dr. Karl E. Haushofer, the thinker whose ideas are often associated with the rise of Adolph Hitler. According to Brands: “The world, wrote Haushofer, needed ‘a general political cleaning up, a redistribution of power.’ The young Eastern European countries lying athwart Germany’s path were ‘state fragments’ that ‘have no longer a right to exist.’”[24] Brands is no doubt correct in interpreting Haushofer’s sentiment toward the East European states as a quest for lebensraum.<br> But it was more than just that. Haushofer’s attack on the legitimacy of the East European nations as mere “fragments” of states was tantamount to an assault on the inter-war balance of power, which was upheld by the alliances led by France and Great Britain. In the absence of a full-blown interpretation of Mackinder’s purpose in writing Democratic Ideals and Reality, Brands cannot provide a nuanced appreciation of Haushofer’s geopolitical thought and rhetorical tactics.<br> CONCLUSION<br> In the final analysis, Hal Brands’ book deserves to be read and discussed among students of international relations and within the foreign policy establishment. However, it does not do justice to the subtleties of classical geopolitical thought. At times, the geography in geopolitics is suppressed in favor of an aspatial assessment of great power competition and conflict. Brand’s failure to provide cartographic visualizations of strategic interactions is a telling aspect of how the geographic component in geopolitics is obscured.<br> Indeed, had Hal Brands attended to Mackinder’s overriding goal in Democratic Ideals and Reality - how to reconcile the enthusiasms and ideals of democracies with the geopolitical realities of power in international relations - he might have offered a more nuanced appreciation of how ideology and geopolitics should interact in the formulation of foreign policy. While he is undoubtedly correct that “ideology and geopolitics are inseparable,”[25] this assertion is an insufficient guide to where, under what conditions, and at what cost maritime-commercial powers should ally with a territorial-autocratic regime of the Heartland to keep Eurasia divided.<br> Acknowledgements: The author thanks Paul Rahe, Jim Sheehan, Kelly Jordan, Geoff Sloan and Michael Hochberg for their comments.

In practice, however, the policy tremors emanating from Washington are shaking the regional foundations of the very economy the President hopes to build.<br> First came the funding freezes, threatening to choke off vital resources for research and innovation. Next came tariffs, which jeopardize the imports and exports that drive regional prosperity. And now the proposed dismantling of the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) signals a withdrawal of traditional federal support from local economic development almost completely.<br> One hundred and twenty days in, the dispatch from the ground is clear: The Administration’s top-down economic agenda needs to be suffused with some bottom-up perspective on how strong regions - and through them, a strong nation - are built.<br> Potential allies?<br> The President would find the field of economic development sympathetic to key elements of his worldview. Trained in cluster theory, most economic developers would agree that, for all the benefits of globalization, the United States also lost something important when high-end value chains once rooted domestically were scattered across the globe.1 The nation has had to relearn that the production process itself is a catalyst for innovation and source of competitive advantage.<br> Economic developers have their gripes with U.S. trade policy, too. Mainstream economics long focused on the macro (trade imbalances) and the micro (individual businesses and consumers) but overlooked the meso, or regional scale of labor markets and production networks. The “China Shock” body of work successfully flipped the script. Finally, there is widespread understanding that, because of their unique industrial mixes, regions are the scale at which trade policy comes to ground.<br> Economic developers would also find common ground with the President in recognizing that Americans identify as both consumers and producers. Communities, like people, derive a large part of their identity from what they produce. Incomplete or failed industrial transitions are therefore social problems in addition to economic ones.<br> And of course, economic developers love a good ribbon-cutting too.<br> But even if there is basic agreement around the ends, the means with which the White House is going about transforming the American economy will in fact make it harder for regions to develop and grow.<br> EDA: The bridge between federal intent and local action<br> Since the 1960s, the federal government has partnered with communities to support their economic development through the EDA. With modest resources - EDA’s budget stood at $464 million in FY2024 (around 0.02% of total discretionary spending) - the federal government empowers the development and execution of local growth strategies nationwide. Eliminating the only federal agency solely dedicated to economic development, as proposed in the President’s FY2026 budget, would devastate many localities’ ability to invest in their own future and undermine the Administration’s own economic goals.<br> For starters, EDA inspires local action. Its competitive grant programs incentivize communities to come up with the best ideas to achieve a goal - be it to improve tech-based workforce development or enhance regional resilience to economic shocks.<br> Take the new Tech Hubs program, launched with bipartisan-backing as the regional plank of the CHIPS and Science Act. The competition motivated nearly 400 regions to submit their best strategies for cementing American competitiveness and security in the technologies of the future.2 Such programs tap into Americans’ competitive zeal and can bring forth surges of civic entrepreneurship. Each administration can put its own imprint on such programs by setting the goals and shaping the application criteria.<br> EDA also serves as a delivery mechanism for key funding streams that support the President’s economic agenda. The Department of Labor administers Trade Adjustment Assistance for workers, but trade adjustment assistance to help firms and regions rebound from trade-related job losses is delivered through EDA.3 EDA’s core programs help communities navigate military base closures, power plant decommissions, and other economic shocks to smooth the transition to new industries. Its Economic Adjustment Assistance program is a swiss army knife of responsive support tailored to local circumstances. Few federal programs are as adaptable.<br> EDA also serves as a capacity builder. If the Administration’s envisioned future (with a dramatically diminished federal presence in the economy) is not to be one of widening regional inequality, communities will need to be able to fend for themselves. EDA’s planning and technical assistance grants help level the playing field. For small population communities, federal support in the form of EDA planning grants can make the difference between having a professional economic development organization and not.<br> EDA itself is a policy incubator. It serves as a uniquely flexible and remarkably experimentative corner of the federal government. EDA has emerged as the regional arm of American industrial policy. When disasters strike, Congress pushes long-term economic recovery dollars through EDA. When the federal government wishes to pilot new industry-aligned models of workforce development, it goes through EDA. EDA programs have been instrumental at critical junctures in the lives of some of the most innovative and entrepreneurial new economic development organizations to emerge in recent years - including around Opportunity Zones, demonstrating how EDA’s capacity-building programs can complement signature administration initiatives.<br> In a testament to EDA’s utility - and to how out of step the President’s proposal is with the bipartisan policy consensus that regards EDA as more valuable today than ever - Congress finally reauthorized the agency in January. The legislation passed 399-18 in the House and 97-1 in the Senate and empowered EDA with a whole new set of tools and authorities that this President can be the first to deploy.<br> To be sure, the nation’s economic development apparatus could use a healthy dose of disruption. Duplication across agencies and programs is a long-standing concern. Evaluation should be more rigorous. Too much federal economic development spending supports talking instead of doing. Strategic ambivalence between concentrating public investment in a few places versus distributing it widely plagues too many programs. But those challenges call for smart reforms, not wholesale elimination.4<br> That shaking feeling<br> The proposal to shut down EDA is the clearest signal yet that the Trump administration plans to jettison the federal government’s long-standing commitment to being a supportive partner in local economic development. But worse than a partner who moves on is one who actively undermines, and the President’s actions are simultaneously placing the two most fundamental pillars of economic development under strain: traded sectors and anchor institutions.<br> Traded sectors are the means by which regions earn their incomes: they power local economies by producing goods or services that get consumed (sold) outside the region, bringing money into it. Paying high wages, their strong multipliers make them engines of local job growth.<br> Sustaining and growing traded sectors is in many ways the very essence of economic development. These traded sectors are intricately woven into global supply chains. That makes them highly dependent on imports and highly vulnerable to export retaliation. A few regions may score new investments induced by tariffs to U.S. shores; more will likely emerge with weakened firms and dried up export opportunities. The inescapable economics of tariffs - concentrated winners; diffuse losers - applies at the regional scale, too.<br> Universities are the quintessential anchor institutions - those trusty stalwarts of economic development that prime local innovation ecosystems, invest heavily in their communities, and serve as stable sources of good jobs. Yet universities must now contend with massive uncertainty around the fate of science and innovation-related funding administered by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies. Even seemingly arcane changes such as the proposed cap on the amount of facilities and administration costs the federal government will reimburse threaten to upend how the country finances its R&amp;D infrastructure.<br> Regarded from the bottom-up, anchor institutions are precious assets. They are key sources of the competitive advantage that local economic development so assiduously seeks to cultivate. Assets sometimes underperform, of course, and many regions likely share the White House’s desire to get more out of them: more research, more innovation, more startups - and all of it faster. Smart federal efforts to invest differently, revisit incentive structures, and shake up sclerotic bureaucracies would likely be welcomed. But invest less? Viewed from the bottom up, such a move serves no local purpose. In fact, it would be economic development malpractice.<br> The regional foundations of national prosperity<br> A cardinal rule of economic development is to build on strengths. Coming off an historic period of legislating, the Trump administration inherits the most robust federal economic development apparatus - the most flexible and innovative tools with the most substantial funding authorizations and most activated network of local partners - of any President in recent history. The industries of tomorrow will be forged in the places where workers, firms, and ideas come together. In his drive to transform the U.S. economy, the President should take a moment to study what makes its regional economic engines tick.<br> Kenan Fikri is a senior fellow at the Economic Innovation Group.

They cower in fear of this cantankerous man, but when they smell blood in the water, they spill all the details. Weeks after that debate implosion, which led to his booting from the Democratic ticket, the staff leaks were numerous and damning. <br> Now, with the prostate cancer diagnosis, an affliction that Joe was likely suffering for years, more aides are leaking details, from knowing that something else might be off besides his mental health to whether he took the Prostate-Specific Antigen test at all. They feared another cover-up was happening. No, it was happening, folks.<br> Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and brother of Rahm Emanuel, said that this stage four metastatic cancer doesn’t magically appear. It takes years; Biden likely had it at the start of his presidency. It wasn’t disclosed. <br> The question is whether this test was administered. You can’t just take the president’s blood. However, at Biden’s age, this screening is an annual chore. It likely would have shown elevated levels. The New York Post had numerous aides come forward, some of whom alluded that Biden’s doctor isn’t discreet, and a PSA test would’ve led to a paper trail that the White House didn’t want at the time. We have another cover-up. Yet, some ran interference for Biden’s doctor (via NY Post): <br>  “I just don’t know how they just, kind of find this out on a Friday, and it’s this far advanced and serious,” the Biden White House aide said. “[If it’s] in the bones, there’s gotta be a discomfort … I think they just didn’t test.” <br>  Another longtime aide to Biden questioned why his presidential physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, didn’t perform a Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test, one of the most common ways to screen for prostate cancer. <br>  The test was not mentioned on Biden’s February 2024 physical report, his last such exam while in office. <br>  “I think the likely scenario, knowing Kevin O’Connor pretty well, is that they had a discussion on what a PSA test is, and they decided not to do one because it would likely be elevated and cause a story, since a lot of older men have high PSAs that are false positives,” this source said. <br>  “A blood test has a paper trail. They probably just didn’t do the test. I think it would leak if he had a PSA test they tried to bury.” <br>  “What’s ironic,” this person added, “is that if they didn’t give the president a PSA test because of the potential for optics of a possible false positive, that decision is ultimately going to lead to his death because they could have caught it earlier.” <br>  […] <br>  Both of The Post’s sources said they had trouble believing that O’Connor - known as “Doc” - had diagnosed Biden’s cancer while he was in office or that the loyal physician, who also worked with Biden during his vice presidency, would have known about any symptoms. <br>  “Frankly, residence staff talk. It would have gotten out,” said the former White House staffer.<br>  “I just know Doc could not have lived with himself if he knew this was happening and he didn’t do everything he could. Also, Doc isn’t discreet. Yes, he’s a doctor, but he’s always chatting.” <br>  O’Connor was never allowed to brief the press on his annual assessments of Biden’s health. He gave a single interview to a news outlet, proclaiming the then-president’s health was ‘excellent” last July when a Post reporter spotted him on the White House driveway and filmed a Q&amp;A. <br> Sorry, the timelines don’t lie. Someone had to have known. And please, when Lady MacBeth issued an order, you bet it was followed. Cancer this advanced, and no one knew. It’s simply unbelievable. Also, given the length the Democrats and the media went to hide Biden’s mental health circus, which up until recently we thought was the worst of the scandal, the trust balance with this clown car is negative. We can’t trust anything the Biden team says because they’re bonafide liars. Also, with this development comes the 2022 slip-up that likely wasn&#39;t:<br> Knowingly keeping a sick, dementia-ridden man in the driver’s seat in a craven attempt to hold onto is unsurprising behavior exhibited by today’s Democratic Party. Also, Jill Biden, you allowed this to happen, didn’t you? You are an awful, miserable woman. <br> It’s also clear again that the Biden White House was clueless, which explains so much regarding the country&#39;s state once this crime lord left.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R18" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">19</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:8557px;left:-1px">ĐÀI LOAN TRONG CÕI BẤP BÊNH<br> Bài tiểu luận trên Foreign Affairs nêu ra những bất nhất của Hoa Kỳ trong đối sách về Đài Loan, trước sự hăm dọa của Trung Cộng.

U.S. strategy broadly revolves around deterring China from attacking Taiwan, and for the past three presidential administrations, it has consisted of three central components: increasing the ability of the United States and Taiwan to defend the island militarily; using diplomacy to signal U.S. resolve to protect Taiwan while also reassuring China that Washington does not support Taiwanese independence; and using economic pressure to slow China’s military modernization efforts.<br> But there is little consensus on the right balance among these three components - and that balance determines to some degree how deterrence looks in practice. Some contend that diplomatic pressure - along with military restraint, to avoid antagonizing China - will keep Beijing at bay. Others warn that unless Washington significantly strengthens its military posture in Asia, deterrence will collapse. And a third approach, outlined recently in Foreign Affairs by Jennifer Kavanagh and Stephen Wertheim, emphasizes that bolstering Taiwan’s self-defense and enabling offshore U.S. support is the best route to sustaining deterrence while also mitigating the risk of escalation.<br> These prescriptions have merit but fall short of grappling with the paradox at the heart of U.S. strategy: deterrence can fail in two ways. Do too little, and Beijing may gamble it can seize Taiwan before Washington is able to respond. Do too much, and Chinese leaders may conclude that force is the only remaining path to unification. Navigating this dilemma requires more than a stronger military or bolder diplomacy. It requires a calibrated strategy of rearmament, reassurance, and restraint that threads the needle between weakness and recklessness. Combined properly, forward-deployed capabilities, diplomatic restraint, and selective economic interdependence can reinforce one another to maintain credible deterrence while avoiding provocation.<br> So far, however, the Trump administration’s approach to Taiwan has veered between harsh transactionalism, such as the imposition of a 32 percent tariff on most Taiwanese goods last month, and quiet reaffirmations of support for Taipei through bipartisan visits and a pause on the highest tariffs. The administration still has time to settle on a coherent strategy, but the window of opportunity is closing.<br> LOOSE LIPS START WARS<br> Currently, the U.S. military is improving its force posture in the vicinity of Taiwan, most notably through expanded access to bases in the Philippines and by reinforcing capabilities in southwestern Japan and the broader western Pacific. In the Philippines, thanks to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, the United States gained access to four new strategic sites, bringing the total there to nine. Several, such as those in Cagayan and Isabela Provinces, are just a few hundred miles from Taiwan.<br> The story is similar in Japan’s case. Washington and Tokyo agreed in 2023 to restructure the U.S. Marine Corps presence in Okinawa from the artillery-focused 12th Marine Regiment, part of a force of roughly 18,000 marines stationed in Japan, into a 2,000-strong Marine Littoral Regiment, a quick-reaction force designed to operate along the so-called first island chain encompassing Indonesia, Japan, portions of the Philippines, and Taiwan. To complement this effort, the U.S. military has increased joint military exercises and expanded integrated air and missile defense systems across allied territories.<br> But U.S. military capabilities in the Pacific need more than just quantitative upgrades; they require qualitative shifts to be able to block China from forcibly unifying with Taiwan. The United States needs a greater forward presence in the region, as well as specific capabilities that would prevent an invading force from making its way across the Taiwan Strait, such as strategic bombers, submarines, and antiship missiles. Once those were deployed, they would also require significant operational flexibility. For example, Washington should prioritize securing forward-deployed submarine tenders in Japan and the Philippines to enable submarines to reload, resupply, and rearm without returning to Guam or Hawaii. And it should work to establish permanent bomber bases in Australia and the Philippines and deploy antiship missile systems in Japan’s southwestern islands and the northern Philippines.<br>  The trade war could make a shooting war seem more appealing to Beijing.<br> So far, the U.S. military has stopped short of seeking such changes because they are politically sensitive both at home and abroad: host countries worry they might become greater targets of Chinese aggression, and some U.S. policymakers worry that such moves could cross a redline for Beijing. But if Washington follows a few principles, such improvements will not necessarily provoke Chinese aggression. First, the United States should not make a public announcement or a spectacle of enhancements to its military force posture. As U.S. forces increase their activities around and in Taiwan, be they joint exercises, freedom of navigation exercises, or training, U.S. officials should refrain from making statements to which China might feel forced to respond. Military upgrades should be concealed or downplayed until they are fielded to minimize the likelihood that China will effectively launch a coercive campaign against their deployment.<br> Bolstering Taiwan’s independent military capabilities - a long-standing U.S. policy - presents an arguably even bigger risk of provocation. Beijing worries that Taiwan will become so certain of its ability to protect itself that it will consider declaring independence. In recent years, Taiwan has acquired defense capabilities with the aim of deterring potential Chinese aggression. It has bought asymmetric warfare systems, such as coastal defense cruise missiles and HIMARS rocket systems, moving away from traditional high-cost platforms such as submarines. It has also pledged that its defense budget will exceed three percent of GDP in 2025 and that it will prioritize precision-guided munitions, air defense upgrades, command-and-control systems, equipment for reserve forces, and anti-drone technologies. These are sensible steps, but they also pose a risk: the less Taiwan depends on U.S. assistance, the more China’s leaders worry that Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, could be emboldened to declare independence unilaterally - further incentivizing Beijing to invade sooner rather than later.<br> To prevent deterrence from morphing into provocation, the United States should provide Taiwan mainly with capabilities that rely on continued U.S. support. In 2024, for example, the Biden administration approved the sale of three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems to Taiwan in a deal that was brokered to increase U.S.-Taiwanese interoperability. In other words, this system was designed to function best in tandem with U.S. support. The United States should continue to encourage Taiwan’s asymmetric defense, particularly by prioritizing the speedy and reliable delivery of systems such as the highly mobile precision HIMARS rockets; advanced air defense missile systems such as the NASAMS; and antiship missiles such as the RGM-84L-4 Block II Harpoon. But Washington should also highlight the aspects of Taiwan’s military capacity that are linked to the United States, reassuring Beijing that the island cannot act alone.<br> WORDS AND DEEDS<br> Reassuring Beijing is a critical component of a successful deterrence strategy. But during both the Trump and the Biden administrations, the United States has relaxed its longstanding policy of “strategic ambiguity,” wherein U.S. policy has avoided defining whether and under what circumstances Washington would intervene to defend Taiwan. Instead, the United States has been signaling to China its determination to defend Taiwan - especially by making incremental moves toward establishing formal diplomatic relations with the island, such as direct interactions between American and Taiwanese officials.<br> Joe Biden was the first U.S. president to invite Taiwan’s diplomatic representatives to attend his inauguration, for example, and he repeatedly referred to a U.S. “commitment” to Taiwan’s defense, even saying once that U.S. forces would defend the island in the event of an “unprecedented attack.” (White House officials stated at the time that there was no change to the official policy of “strategic ambiguity.”) Officials in the second Trump administration, including Mike Waltz before he was ousted as national security adviser, have advocated ending strategic ambiguity and moving toward “strategic clarity.” And in February, the State Department removed a statement about not supporting Taiwan’s independence from its website - a deletion that China interpreted as provocative.<br> Although they may seem merely symbolic, such diplomatic slights have real consequences, making it harder for Beijing to maintain a veneer of progress toward unification of the mainland with Taiwan. Chinese leaders see any drift toward Taiwanese independence as a threat to their legitimacy. So, far from deterring Beijing, U.S. provocations - official diplomatic interactions, references to Taiwan as a country, calls for a U.S.-Taiwanese alliance - could incentivize Beijing to undertake a cross-strait invasion.<br> Reassurance that Washington does not support Taiwanese independence should include public criticism when Taiwan’s leaders make statements or take actions that suggest otherwise. For example, in December 2003, President George W. Bush publicly rebuked Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian during a joint press conference with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, stating that the United States opposed any “unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo,” noting that Chen’s “comments and actions” had indicated “that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change” it. In 2006, after Chen angered Beijing by scrapping a government council that had been established to guide unification with China, the Bush administration once again signaled its disapproval, denying the Taiwanese leader’s request for a high-profile U.S. stopover during a presidential trip to Latin America. These sorts of reassurances helped convince Chinese leaders that future “peaceful reunification” remained possible, reducing the likelihood of an invasion.<br> The United States should also keep trying to build a multilateral consensus for peace in the Taiwan Strait. For instance, joint statements issued at the G-7 summit last month and at the Munich Security Conference in February reaffirmed cross-strait stability and expressed opposition to any unilateral actions that threaten peace in the Taiwan Strait, including through force or coercion. Washington should pair these diplomatic signals with a clear reaffirmation that its “one China” policy remains in place, that any resolution must be nonviolent, and that the United States is not against peaceful unification with Taiwan’s assent.<br> FROM TRADE WAR TO SHOOTING WAR<br> These changes to military capabilities and to U.S. diplomacy are easy compared with what is required in the third area of U.S. deterrence strategy: economic pressure. Economic pressure can undermine deterrence and reassurance alike. Since the first Trump administration, the United States has pursued an economic containment strategy to slow China’s long-term growth and deny it advanced technologies, with the aim of hampering its capacity to match U.S. military investments. This began with the first Trump administration’s tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese goods. The Biden administration not only kept these tariffs in place but also added export controls on strategically important technologies, such as semiconductors and telecommunications. The United States also pressured American companies to shift their supply chains and manufacturing operations away from China.<br> The second Trump administration has threatened to accelerate an economic decoupling from China with even wider-ranging, unconditional tariffs, although the prospect of financial pain for the United States seems to have given it pause for now. Nonetheless, these policies portend lasting damage to the Chinese economy, especially in view of China’s looming demographic and environmental challenges. For Washington, the hope remains that Beijing may be unable to keep pace militarily as its relative growth rate slows.<br> But the ongoing U.S.-Chinese trade war and escalating American export and investment restrictions have deepened Beijing’s mistrust and reinforced its claim that Washington seeks containment rather than peaceful coexistence. This economic pressure not only risks hardening China’s resolve but also enables Beijing to recast itself as a defender of global trade norms and to shift blame for any global economic slowdown to the United States. At the same time, the United States risks forfeiting its long-term leverage, as the tariffs may goad Beijing to deepen its commitment to what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) calls “domestic demand expansion,” or selling more products at home instead of exporting them. Such a shift in China’s economy would encourage domestic production and innovation and accelerate efforts to reduce reliance on foreign markets.<br> This U.S. strategy will also have limited effects on China’s long-term military prowess. China has pursued military modernization at historically low costs, avoiding the classic “guns or butter” dilemma. China has not matched U.S. defense spending dollar for dollar, as challengers did in earlier great-power rivalries. Nazi Germany, for instance, spent twice as much on its military as the United Kingdom did between 1933 and 1939. And during the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet defense budgets signaled direct competition: the United States spent an average of 32 percent more than the Soviet Union until 1970, when the Soviet Union took the lead, outspending the U.S. by an average of 26 percent until 1988. In contrast, China has made targeted investments intended to give it an advantage in a quick, limited war, while keeping its overall defense spending relatively modest: Beijing’s defense spending has risen from five percent of U.S. levels in 1995 to 32 percent in 2017. In this way, China has sustained both economic development and military modernization, but avoided a Cold War­–style arms race. China will therefore be able to continue its military modernization program even with a stagnant economy, especially if it increases its military spending as a share of GDP.<br> Fighter jets on a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in the East China Sea, November 2024<br> Fighter jets on a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in the East China Sea, November 2024 Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters<br> Indeed, instead of hampering China’s military, the trade war could make a shooting war seem more appealing to Beijing. Currently Chinese leaders would consider an invasion of Taiwan only in a specific, narrow scenario: if China could take the island before U.S. forces could intervene. For Beijing, a larger-scale, protracted war would be too costly. This is partly because of the economic value of the U.S.-Chinese relationship. But if U.S. economic pressure increases, Chinese leaders could conclude that the benefits of continued economic engagement are low and that conflict with the United States is the only way to get out from under the American thumb. This would make them more willing to risk war over Taiwan.<br> Concrete economic and diplomatic concessions that increase China’s benefits from maintaining the status quo and credibly convey benign U.S. intent would be effective reassurances. Pausing or reversing the economic decoupling is an obvious place to start; Washington should rescind tariffs on Chinese imports (or at least make them conditional on reasonable Chinese reciprocation) and relax its restrictions on exports and on incoming investment in all but the most sensitive technologies and sectors. This would not only quell Beijing’s perception that the United States seeks to weaken and “split” China but also allay any brewing domestic instability that could threaten the CCP’s legitimacy and encourage Chinese leaders to forcibly take Taiwan to boost nationalist legitimacy. Perhaps most important, sustaining economic interdependence, especially the asymmetric sort that currently exists, gives the United States enormous leverage over China by allowing it to threaten heavier sanctions in the event of war. Unilateral U.S. sanctions could set the Chinese economy on a path of permanent decline. Pausing or circumscribing an economic decoupling would give U.S. sanctions maximum bite and bolster deterrence.<br> Of course, bolstering economic interdependence also requires limiting U.S. reliance on key Chinese imports, such as rare-earth minerals, transformers for the electric grid, scarce medicines, high-tech electronics, and other industrial, infrastructural, and military inputs. The United States should diversify its sources for these imports and reduce the proportion that China provides to acceptable levels. But Washington does not need to immediately reduce imports of Chinese consumer goods, even though substitutes can be found relatively easily. Allowing such imports to continue would enable the United States to avoid destabilizing China while retaining the threat of painful sanctions. Finally, to maximize its deterrent leverage against China, Washington should coordinate a sanctions coalition with allies, which may require offering them subsidies or other concessions.<br> For many in Washington, deterrence has come to mean projecting an uncompromising and even hostile posture toward China. But such gestures do not meaningfully augment Taiwan’s security. Instead, the United States should invest quietly in its military readiness and capabilities, speak carefully, and maintain economic resilience and even some interdependence. The dilemma of deterrence - the fact that it can so easily slide into provocation or procrastination - necessitates such a tightrope approach. And if there’s one place where striking the right balance could pay enormous dividends, it’s Taiwan.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R19" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">20</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3857px;left:-1px">ĐẢNG DÂN CHỦ VƯỢT LẰN RANH ĐỎ ĐỂ...

From Democratic members of Congress to judges to city council members, officials claim that their official duties include obstructing the official functions of the federal government. It is a type of liberal license that excuses most any crime in the name of combating what Minn. Gov. Tim Walz called the “modern-day Gestapo” of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).<br> The latest claimant of this license is Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), who was charged with assaulting, resisting, and impeding law enforcement officers during a protest at Delaney Hall ICE detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. McIver is shown on video forcing her way into an ICE facility and striking and shoving agents in her path.<br> This was not a major incursion, but these state and federal officials joined a mob in briefly overwhelming security and breaching the fence barrier after a bus was allowed through the entrance. Federal officials were able to quickly force back the incursion.<br> McIver and House Democrats insisted that McIver’s forcing her way into the facility might be trespass and assault for other citizens, but she was merely exercising “legislative oversight.” Rep. Alexandria Ocacio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) declared “You lay a finger on someone – on Bonnie Watson Coleman or any of the representatives that were there – you lay a finger on them, we’re going to have a problem.”<br> Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) even ominously warned the federal government that Democrats would bring down the house if it tried to charge McIver: “It’s a red line. They know better than to go down that road.”<br> Well, the red line was crossed in a big way after Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba charged McIver with a felony under Title 18, United States Code, Section 111(a)(1).<br> The ACLU called the charged “authoritarianism” and insisted that these state and federal politicians “have every right to exercise their legally authorized oversight responsibilities for expanded immigration detention in New Jersey.”<br> The problem with the oversight claim is that McIver’s status as a member of Congress does not allow her access into closed federal facilities. Congress can subpoena the Executive Branch or secure court orders for access. However, members do not have immunity from criminal laws in unilaterally forcing their way into any federal office or agency.<br> If that were the case, Rep. Alexandria Ocacio-Cortez would not have posted images of herself crying at the fence of an immigrant facility, she could have climbed over the fence in the name of oversight.<br> Conversely, Republicans in the Biden Administration could have simply pushed their way into the Justice Department to seek the files on the influence-peddling scandal.<br> Yet, the point of the claim is less of a real criminal defense and more of a political excuse.<br> It is the same claim being heard this week from Worcester City Councilor Etel Haxhiaj who was shown in a video shoving and obstructing ICE officers attempting to arrest a woman on immigration charges. Two other individuals (including a Democratic candidate for a school board) were arrested, but not Haxhiaj who claimed that she was merely protecting “a constituent.” After the melee, the city manager issued an order preventing city police from assisting in any way in the carrying out of such civil immigration enforcement efforts by the federal government.<br> Even judges are claiming the same license. In Wisconsin, Judge Hannah Dugan has been charged with obstructing a federal arrest of an illegal immigrant who appeared in her courtroom. Dugan heard about agents waiting outside in the hallway to arrest the man and went outside to confront the agents. She told them to speak to the Chief Judge and that they needed a different warrant.<br> The agents complied and the Chief Judge confirmed that they could conduct the arrest. In the interim, however, Dugan led the man out a non-public door and facilitated his escape (he was arrested after a chase down a public street).<br> Judge Duggan also claimed that she was carrying out her duties even though her hearing was over, the charges were not part of state matter, and the arrest was being carried out outside of her courtroom.<br> As Democratic leaders like Walz engage in rage rhetoric and paint Republicans (and federal law enforcement) as Nazis, political violence is on the rise across the country. Many of the people burning Teslas and engaging in such crimes claim the same type of license that the ends justify the means. That includes affluent professionals who are now shoplifting from Whole Foods as a “protest” against Jeff Bezos meeting with Trump.<br> When the Administration sought to investigate those burning Teslas and dealerships, Rep. Dan Goldman (D., N.Y.) denounced it as a “political weaponization” of the legal system. The comments suggest that such arson is somehow a form of political expression on the left.<br> House Minority Leader Jeffries was correct that a “red line” was crossed but not the one that he was thinking of in threatening consequences for any charges. The red line is the one separating political expression and criminal conduct.<br> Border Czar stressed repeatedly to political leaders that they can protest and refuse to help but “you can‘t cross the line” into obstruction and interference with their operations.<br> If oversight means that members can force their way into any federal facilities, we would have 535 roaming inspectors general who could wander at will through the executive branch.<br> Rep. McIver would be better to claim a different type of oversight, in allowing her passion to briefly overwhelm her judgment in rushing into the facility.<br> In the end, however, McIver and Duggan may have a license of a different kind.<br> Both have the advantage of being charged in liberal districts where they would appear before sympathetic jurors.

Photo: Ken Cedeno/Reuters<br> Key Points: - What&#39;s This?<br> * Trump pressured House Republicans to unite behind his budget reconciliation bill.<br> * The bill includes extending tax cuts, boosting border spending, and repealing climate tax credits.<br> * Factions are divided over Medicaid cuts and raising the cap on state and local tax deductions.<br> WASHINGTON — President Trump visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday to do what he does best: Use his bully pulpit to pressure unruly Republican lawmakers to get on board with his agenda.<br> In a closed-door meeting with the House Republican conference, the president urged fiscal conservatives to give up efforts to expand Medicaid cuts and moderates to drop their drive for further blue-state tax relief, pushing them to unite around his “one big beautiful” budget reconciliation bill, according to people familiar with his comments. <br> “Don’t f— around with Medicaid,” he said, according to attendees.<br> Trump’s visit comes at a high-stakes moment: House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) has said he wants to vote on the package as soon as Wednesday, with passage no later than the coming Memorial Day weekend. But party factions remained far apart on a series of sticking points.<br> The measure funds a series of the promises Trump made on the campaign trail including extending his 2017 tax cuts and making new ones, boosting border spending, repealing climate tax credits and more. <br> A senior White House official said Trump “made clear he’s losing patience with all holdout factions.” The president backs work requirements for Medicaid and exclusion of unauthorized immigrants, but doesn’t want additional changes, and further changes to SALT deductions can be tackled in a future bill, the official said. <br> House Republicans are racing to mend party divisions and pass President Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful” tax-and-spending bill. WSJ’s Olivia Beavers explains key disagreements within the party ahead of its Memorial Day deadline. Photo Illustration: Elise Dean<br> Heading into the meeting, the president warned of the consequences of failing to pass his bill, noting that taxes would rise for many American households should Congress fail to extend the tax provisions from his first term and that Republican holdouts could face primary challenges.<br> “What Republican would vote for that? Because they wouldn’t be a Republican much longer. They would be knocked out so fast.” Trump said to reporters before the meeting, arguing the party is united—except for “one or two grandstanders.” He took aim at one of the House Republicans expected to vote against the bill, saying Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.) should be “voted out of office.”<br> Rep. Michael Baumgartner (R., Wash.) compared the meeting to a locker room before a big football game. <br> Trump “told every Republican House member what play he is calling - put the bill on the floor, vote for it and score a touchdown for America,” Baumgartner said.<br> Republicans can afford to lose only a handful of votes in the House, where they have a 220-213 majority. Democrats are united in opposition, saying the proposal cuts Medicaid to fund tax cuts for the wealthy.<br> Trump is trying to close the deal amid continued grumbling from different wings of his party. <br> “It’s a deficit-spending bill. It actually grows the deficit this Congress,” said Rep. Warren Davidson (R., Ohio), a deficit hawk and Trump ally, who said ahead of the meeting that he was a “no” vote. Asked if Trump could say anything to get him to change his mind, Davidson said there has to be a “plan to actually cut spending.”<br> The bill would cut taxes by nearly $4 trillion, compared with doing nothing, while generating about $1.6 trillion in spending reductions and other deficit-reducing policies. <br> Some fiscal conservatives are seeking to enact deeper and faster changes to Medicaid, which serves 70 million low-income and disabled people, to limit the growth of the federal deficit. But centrists and other Republicans warn that further cuts would hurt the party’s chances of keeping the House majority in the midterm elections. On Sunday night, four conservative holdouts allowed the bill to proceed through the Budget Committee, but they said their concerns weren’t fully resolved.<br> TRUMP&#39;S TAX PLAN<br> Some members are pressing the idea of cutting back on the share the federal government contributes to Medicaid. Johnson has repeatedly taken that idea off the table, but spending hawks say it needs to be part of the mix, citing rising budget deficits and saying that the matching rate is unfair to states that declined to expand Medicaid to cover more low-income people, as permitted by the 2010 Affordable Care Act.<br> A day earlier, Johnson held a series of meetings with various factions. He met with the Republican Main Street Caucus, where people familiar with the meeting said he was in listening mode, making notes on a writing pad as his GOP members raised issues with Medicaid and energy tax issues, including about nuclear power.<br> Johnson then jetted to another meeting, largely composed of conservative House Freedom Caucus members and a group of centrists, where they tried to iron out various sticking points, according to people familiar with this meeting.<br> Johnson also met with the New York Republicans insisting on an increase in the SALT cap, seeking to nail down a deal with them. These SALT Republicans, however, were dismissive of the offer Johnson put forward. Rep. Mike Lawler of New York described the latest proposal as “insufficient,” while heading into the meeting with Trump. <br> Inside the room Tuesday, Trump pushed Republicans holding out for better terms on SALT to accept the latest offer from Johnson, according to people in the room. The initial GOP proposal called for raising the cap to $30,000 from $10,000, and Johnson made another proposal on Monday night. Trump called out Lawler specifically on the matter, the people said. <br> Some centrists felt conservatives were hurting the deal they felt they made when it came to Medicaid.<br> “We negotiated in good faith, in the committees - won some, lost some, and the committee votes it out. And then these guys want to undo it,” said Rep. Don Bacon (R., Neb.), one of the three Republicans who represents a district won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. “I thought we found a good compromise.”</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R21" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">22</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:6065px;left:-1px">TÂM SỰ CỦA NGƯỜI GÀN!<br> Hôm nay, Sharyl Attkisson đi bài phỏng vấn dân biểu Cộng Hòa Thomas Massie của tiểu bang Kentucky.

His no-nonsense libertarian flair has made him a Kentucky fan favorite since 2012 where he’s racked up landslides past 80 percent at the polls. He may be Mr. Popular at home, but in DC he’s dubbed Mr. No. And his contrarian ways have put him in President Trump’s crosshairs. Today, he’s holding nothing back - calling out his overspending colleagues and the corrupting ways of the swamp.<br> The following is a transcript of a report from “Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson.”<br> Watch the video by clicking the link at the end of the page.<br> Rep. Thomas Massie: I think the uniparty here is on the same path they were on before President Trump was elected.<br> Republican Thomas Massie frequently says the quiet part out loud.<br> Massie (May 1, 2024): It is because Mike Johnson was doing Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden’s bidding.<br> Even when it’s talking out of school about fellow Republicans, their House leader Mike Johnson, the Trump agenda, and The Swamp.<br> Massie: That’s the real untold story here. And I think we may be on a collision course, like I think there’s three cars coming together at an intersection and they don’t realize they’re gonna hit. And one of them is Congress with Mike Johnson driving, is in one of these cars. Trump obviously is one of these cars. Maybe he’s the train. And then there’s another car, which is DOGE. And I don’t think Elon Musk is gonna suffer these fools once he finds out how foolish they are or duplicitous they are. You don’t land rockets backwards, you don’t get cars to drive themselves on the interstate, by ignoring the fools that you’re working with.<br> Sharyl: What fools are you referring to?<br> Massie: Mike Johnson.<br> Sharyl: Because?<br> Massie: He’s the leader of the fools. I mean we can just - anybody following him now as a fool as well.<br> Sharyl: Because?<br> Massie: Because.<br> Sharyl: The spending primarily? Or?<br> Massie: It’s a suicide pact to, to suspend us into oblivion.<br> A fiscal hawk and MIT-educated engineer, Massie’s record in Congress is a highlight reel of lone dissent. He even wears his obsession on his sleeve, actually his lapel, sporting a mini-debt clock he designed, ticking up the nation’s $36 trillion tab in real time.<br> In 2020, he infuriated both parties by forcing lawmakers back to D.C. for an in person vote by name on a $2.2 trillion Covid relief bill he saw as fiscally reckless.<br> Massie (March 27, 2020): Mr. Speaker I came here to make sure our republic doesn’t die by unanimous consent and empty chamber and I request a recorded vote.<br> In 2022, he was the only House member to reject a resolution against antisemitism. He argued it threatened free speech. He’s continued taking solo stances this year.<br> Massie: Well, I’ve stood alone three times so far in three months. I was the only dissenting Republican on making Mike Johnson the speaker. I was the only dissenting Republican on our budget. And I was the lone dissenting Republican on the continuing resolution, which is a cut copy paste of Biden’s last 15 months in office, which is going to do the same thing for the first nine months of Trump’s administration.<br> He calls colleagues two-faced on Trump’s government-shrinking agenda - like plans to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development or USAID.<br> Massie: There are Republicans, for instance, that want that USAID money. I mean there was a surreal moment for me at the State of the Union when Trump talked about cutting all these DOGE things that they had discovered. And my colleagues all stood up and cheered. And I’m like, ‘You are the ones who funded all of this’. Like DOGE is cutting the things that you all did and now you’re applauding. And Elon Musk is at odds with a lot of those Republicans who stood up and clapped. But they’re playing along with it right now, and they’re gonna do sort of a, I would call it Rope a Dope maybe to use a Kentucky boxer analogy here. They’re just letting Elon wear himself out.<br> Massie is also a standout for rejecting what he sees as the corrupting cash grab in Congress. Both parties push members to hit fundraising quotas in order to get rewarded with prime spots on committees. Then they use those roles to rake in donations from the very industries they oversee - blurring ethical lines.<br> Sharyl: Wait, you’re describing a relationship where you have to raise money for yourself or for the party..<br> Massie: For the party<br> Sharyl: to get a good position on a committee?<br> Massie: To get a good committee. This is why I’ll never be on what’s called an ‘A’ committee. Those committees are like Financial Services, Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce. Energy and Commerce by the way, regulates the pharmaceutical companies.<br> Sharyl: Because then when you’re on the important committee, you’ll do the lobbyists’ bidding or whatever they prefer, theoretically?<br> Massie: Yeah, if you find that somebody is on a committee that oversees the pharmaceutical companies, you’re gonna see - that’s who the pharmaceutical companies donate to. But you’re told before you get on the committee, “Don’t even ask for one of these ‘A’ committees unless you’re ready to do the hard work ‘across the street’.” ’Across the street’ means you can’t call up and ask for money here in this building we’re in right now, you have to walk across the street to the NRCC and make those phone calls. So they’ll tell you ‘unless you’re ready to do the hard work across the street, don’t ask for one of these committees.’<br> Sharyl: I hear they have like a board up that tells how much, who’s raised how much and what they’re supposed to raise?<br> Massie: It’s the Wall of Shame. So there’s a board that shows what your quota is based on your committee assignment. So if you’re on a lesser committee, you may only have to raise $300,000 every election cycle. But if you’re wanna win these bigger committees, it’s more like a million dollars or half a million dollars you need to raise and give to the party to stay in their good graces. If you look on the wall of shame, I’m at zero.<br> Sharyl: No ‘Dialing for Dollars’ for you?<br> Massie: I haven’t done it. I’ve not done it. I do, by the way, I do help the party. I do give money to candidates who are running in close elections, who have what I believe are sound principles. So I will help them in that way. I’ll go to the fundraisers and help ’em raise money, but I just don’t agree with the sort of extortion that goes on with these committee assignments<br> Massie’s relationship with Trump is a Capitol Hill soap opera. In 2020, Trump branded him a ‘third rate grandstander’ and tried to oust him over forcing the in-person Covid vote, but later endorsed Massie for re-election. Massie endorsed Ron DeSantis in 2024 then switched to Trump.<br> Massie: I’ve had three conversations or interactions with the president in the last nine months. One: He called and left condolences for my loss of my wife, which was very kind. I think it’s part of the president a lot of people don’t see. He didn’t need to do that. It didn’t gain him anything politically. But he took time out of his day to call me and offer his condolences. And then I talked to him about two weeks before the election about endorsing him, which I ultimately did that same day. And I initiated that phone call and he took my call on the second ring. And then I talked to him two weeks after the election, roughly about cabinet secretaries. There was discussion and, RFK Jr was a big fan of this, and the people that are supporting him was, hoped to see me be Ag secretary. And I would’ve done it, it’s not my life ambition, I think I could do a good job of it, but I spoke to Trump about that as well.<br> Sharyl: So you didn’t get picked for that - I didn’t know you were even considered.<br> Massie: Maybe I was, maybe I wasn’t. I don’t know. But three great positive interactions.<br> That was before Massie’s was the sole GOP “no” vote on two important Trump-backed bills that passed anyway: one on the budget, another a spending bill that avoided a government shutdown. He said both were fiscally irresponsible.<br> Trump lashed out on Truth Social, branding Massie a “GRANDSTANDER” and vowing to “lead the charge” to get him defeated in his next election.<br> Massie: This is deja vu. He’s called me a ‘grandstander’ again. But this time he didn’t qualify it as ‘third rate.’ So I think I’m moving up in the world. But what people know about me is if you attack me, I’m probably gonna dig in. You’re not gonna move me. I’m not bullied. I have no hard feelings toward the president. Sometimes he’s a bull in a China shop, and if a few of my dishes get broken, I’m okay.<br> Sharyl: Do you think that’s more about swampy people around him trying to have his ear about you?<br> Massie: Oh, I absolutely do. I think people were whispering in his ear, ‘You need to do something, Mr. President.’ That day, or about a day before that attack, I had come out against getting involved in a war with Iran. And I think there are people in and around the administration who are whispering in his ear, you know, ‘You need to whack this guy. He’s feeling his oats here and talking about not having a war and not getting involved in the Middle East and give him a dose of medicine.’ The tune-up doesn’t work on me. I think it’s performative to influence other members of Congress who might not be able to weather this. I joke that I’ve got Trump antibodies from a natural infection in 2020. This was my booster.<br> Sharyl (on-camera): For more on this story, listen to my podcast Full Measure After Hours.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R22" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">23</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:6693px;left:-1px">LÁ THƯ CẢM ĐỘNG CỦA HAI HỌC GIẢ GỬI CHO TRUMP<br> Họ quá lương thiện và kính trọng chức vụ Tổng thống nên thiếu lời nịnh hót.

(Photo by Atta Kenare/AFP via Getty Images)<br> ***<br> Dear Mr. President,<br> You are about to make a decision for which you will be remembered by history. Your legacy will either be as a world leader who saved, or failed to save, many lives. The decision concerns Iran&#39;s intention to develop a nuclear arsenal. There can be no reasonable doubt that Iran&#39;s mullahs are determined to obtain nuclear weapons, despite their assurances to the contrary. Nor can Israel, which is the intended target of an Iranian bomb, be expected to rely on deterrence or containment. Iran must be prevented from achieving their dangerous goal.<br> Obviously it would be better if the mullahs could be stopped by negotiation rather than military action. Previous negotiations resulted in a terrible deal under President Barack Obama. You yourself understood that under the Obama deal, Iran would almost certainly have obtained a nuclear arsenal, and so you quite correctly withdrew from the agreement. Now there are rumors that your administration is working on a &quot;better&quot; deal – longer and stronger. But unless your deal includes the complete and total destruction of all Iranian nuclear facilities, there will be no guarantee that its scientists could not surreptitiously use civilian nuclear infrastructure to build military weaponry. The only deal that would prevent this catastrophe would be one modeled on the agreement made with Libya made back in 2003. That deal completely dismantled Libya&#39;s nuclear facilities and made it impossible for them to weaponize nuclear energy infrastructure. Anything short of that will create an unacceptable risk.<br> We urge you to use your incredible negotiating skills to achieve the goal that you have set out: namely a 100% certainty that Iran will never get a nuclear bomb. You should give the mullahs a short period of time to dismantle and destroy, subject to American inspection, their entire nuclear program. If they refuse or fail to do so, the military option should be deployed.<br> Nearly a century ago, the British and French governments faced a similar decision with Germany, and they failed, costing tens of millions of lives.<br> A military attack on Germany in the mid-1930s, when its war machine was still weak, might have saved many of these lives. Here is what Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote in his memoir:<br>  &quot;In 1933 a French premier ought to have said (and if I had been the French premier, I would have said it): &#39;The new Reich chancellor is the man who wrote Mein Kampf, which says this and that. This man cannot be tolerated in our vicinity. Either he disappears or we March!&#39; But they didn&#39;t do it. They left us alone and let us slip through the risky zone, and we were able to sail around all dangerous reefs. And when we were done, and well armed, better than they, then they started the war!&quot;<br> The rest is tragic history. Germany built up its armed forces without countermeasures by its intended enemies, conquered most of Western Europe and killed millions of people. Most of those deaths could certainly have been avoided had Great Britain and France engaged in preventive military action before Germany became &quot;well armed&quot; and capable of inflicting so much damage on the world.<br> At the moment in history when Great Britain and France could have prevented the horrendous harm done by Nazi Germany, there was no way of knowing in advance the extent of what Adolf Hitler would do.<br> Yes, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, but many would-be conquerors do not follow through on their threats. (Recall the threat of the Soviet Union&#39;s Premier Nikita Khrushchev to &quot;bury&quot; the United States, yet he backed away from a nuclear confrontation over Cuba.)<br> There was no way of predicting, with any degree of certainty that Hitler would turn his belligerent rhetoric into military invasions of Poland, Europe and then the Soviet Union - and ultimately the Holocaust. It was, as it always is, a question of cost-benefit probabilities. This was a classic case of a false negative: implicitly predicting that Hitler would not do what, in fact, he did, and failing to take action in an effort to prevent it. If France and Great Britain had accurately predicted Hitler&#39;s actual harm correctly, they would almost certainly have taken preventive military action even if the cost were high – because it would never have been nearly as high as it turned out to be in the absence of such action.<br> But history is blind to the predictive future. Had Great Britain and France engaged in preventive military action in the 1930s that resulted in the deaths of, say, 15,000 British and French soldiers and civilians, the leaders who undertook such a military campaign would have been condemned as warmongers, because no one would ever know how many deaths they prevented by the sacrifice of those 15,000 lives. Ignorance of the hypothetical future is often the reason for failure to act in the present. That is the dilemma of failing to take preventive military action.<br> Mr. President, we are once again at a decisive decision point. And you are the decider. We urge you to do the right thing: take the necessary actions that will assure, with absolute certainty, that Iran will never obtain a nuclear arsenal, even if the only way to secure that certainly ends up being through military action.<br> ___<br> (Alan M.

Photo: Christopher Pike/Bloomberg News<br> Key Points - What&#39;s This?<br> * Elon Musk plans to reduce his political spending, stating he believes he has done enough.<br> * Musk previously spent a considerable fortune helping to elect President Trump in 2024.<br> * Musk indicated he might increase spending again if conditions change, but currently sees no reason.<br> Elon Musk says he plans to cut back on political spending, after making huge donations in the 2024 election to boost President Trump.<br> “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” he said in a video interview at the Qatar Economic Forum. “I think I’ve done enough.” <br> Musk, the world’s richest person, who according to filings spent close to $300 million in 2024 to help Trump and other Republicans, indicated he still could increase spending again if conditions change.<br> “If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,” he said. “I do not currently see a reason.”<br> Musk played a polarizing role in the early weeks of the Trump administration, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency as it slashed federal spending and jobs.<br> In April, Musk said he was going to spend less time in Washington and more overseeing Tesla, his electric-vehicle company. Investors had grown worried that he had taken his eye off the ball, with Tesla’s sales and share price dropping during his time in the White House.<br> On Tuesday, asked if he would still be chief executive of Tesla in five years, Musk said, “Yes.” He then added a caveat, saying, “Well, I might die.”<br> President Trump said last month that he would like to keep Elon Musk “for a long time” after the billionaire announced he would devote less hours to the Department of Government Efficiency. Photo: Mandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images<br> The Wall Street Journal recently reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that Tesla board members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Tesla’s next CEO. The board members, concerned that Musk was spending too much time in Washington, told him he needed to spend more time on Tesla. <br> Tesla later issued a denial and Musk criticized the article on X, his social-media platform.<br> Musk shrugged off declining Tesla sales - deliveries fell 13% in the first three months of the year compared with a year earlier - saying that while the company had lost some liberal customers over his prominent role in the Trump administration, it had gained others among his political supporters.<br> “Our sales are doing well at this point,” he said. “It’s already turned around.”<br> Last month when Tesla reported first-quarter earnings, the electric-vehicle maker’s net income fell by 71%, in part, on weaker demand. <br> In an interview on CNBC later Tuesday, Musk said Tesla was “seeing a major rebound in demand” and brushed off concerns about consumer reaction to his political activities. “When you buy a product, I mean how much do you care about the political views of the CEO?” <br> Musk also said that he expected a handful of autonomous robotaxis would be on roads in Austin, Texas, by the end of June. From there, Tesla will expand to other cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles. He predicted by year’s end there will be hundreds of thousands of self-driving Teslas in the U.S., though not specifically robotaxis. <br> After initially planning to stay out of the 2024 election, Musk became one of the largest individual donors in U.S. election history. Musk then turned his sights to the state level, pouring more than $23 million into a Wisconsin state Supreme Court race in April to boost a Republican-backed candidate.

Gavekal’s Will Denyer and Tan Kai Xian examine the possible scenarios.<br> Key Points:<br> * Other things being equal, higher tariff revenue will help reduce the federal deficit.<br> * Congress seems likely to raise the deficit with tax cuts that outweigh spending cuts.<br> * The key question is whether tariff revenue will rise enough to offset the other fiscal expansion.<br> * Net deficit contraction would likely be negative for US equities.<br> * The more likely scenario, an expanded budget deficit only partially offset by tariff revenue, would be positive for growth, US equities and the US dollar, and negative for Treasury bonds.<br> * The risk is that upward pressure on yields could morph into a market panic, driven by foreign investor selling.<br> * Bottom Line: An uncomfortable reality is the stock market likes deficit spending, at least in the short run, since most of the money becomes revenue for US businesses. This is why serious attempts to balance the budget are usually bearish for stocks. But so are the higher bond rates that a rising debt may produce. There’s no easy way out of the box we are in.<br> - Patrick Watson<br> __<br> RẤT NÊN ĐỌC NGUYÊN BẢN CỦA GAVEKAL:<br> Tax Cuts vs. Tariff Hikes - bY Will Denyer, Tan Kai Xian | May 20, 2025 <br> US equities and treasuries brushed off Moody’s rating downgrade of US sovereign debt as old news and inconsequential. Its stripping of the US government’s AAA “risk free” rating comes two years after Fitch and 14 years after S&amp;P did the same. It does not matter since all three rating agencies still classify US debt as investment grade, meaning there will be no wave of forced sales to meet regulations or fund mandates. What does matter for investors <br> is how negotiations over the domestic budget and, separately, import tariffs play out - and their effect on US budget deficits. <br> Anything is possible on both fronts, as the domestic budget is still being negotiated by Congress, while import tariff rates are still being negotiated between the Trump administration and foreign trade partners. But we can consider possible scenarios, assess <br> which seems most probable, and consider the market consequences. <br> First, a few simplifying assumptions. For now, we ignore government spending cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, assuming they will be a rounding error as a factor <br> driving the US’s fiscal outlook in the next decade. There have always been good reasons to be skeptical that DOGE will significantly move the needle on deficits in the current context <br> (see DOGE Versus Reality). And thus far, there is no verifiable evidence that DOGE is having a large and lasting impact on federal spending. <br> The second simplifying assumption is that US GDP growth will average something close to its structural rate of 2%, as assumed by most professional forecasters. Of course, this will be wrong to some degree: US tax cuts and deregulation could boost growth, while tariffs, stricter immigration and policy uncertainty could detract from it. For now, we assume these positives and negatives will roughly net out over the next decade. Finally, we assume all policy changes are “permanent”. Of course, tariffs, domestic taxes and spending plans can - and will - change over the next 10 years, but we do not want to get confused by Congressional gimmicks, such as sunsetting tax cuts to reduce long-term cost estimates, knowing these cuts are likely to be extended. <br> While the situation is fluid, increased tariffs will contract the deficits, while it seems likely that Congress will increase deficits. It is just a question of how much, for both. This leaves us with two probable scenarios: <br> 1. Trump’s tariffs contract the deficit more than domestic tax cuts increase it. <br> 2. Domestic tax cuts expand the deficit more than tariffs contract it. <br> What would be the market consequences of these two scenarios? <br> The first scenario - in which increased tariff revenues outweigh domestic tax cuts resulting in a net deficit contraction - would likely be negative for US equities. Some of the burden from higher tariffs would be borne by US firms and a net contraction in deficits would <br> probably constrain US growth - which, in turn, would weigh on the US dollar. The impact on US treasuries is less clear. Slower growth and debt issuance could support treasuries, but with tariffs being the primary driver of the contraction, the dominant effect may be reduced foreign demand for US government paper, potentially weighing on its price. <br> The second scenario - in which the domestic budget expands deficits, and this is only partially offset by tariffs - should be positive for growth, US equities, and the dollar. At least that would be a normal market reaction to deficit expansion. It would also likely be negative for treasury bonds - on stronger growth and more issuance. The risk in this scenario is that upward pressure on yields due to an expansionary budget morphs into a market panic <br> driven by foreign investor selling (see The Meaning Of The Dollar Rout and Investing After Exceptionalism). This would be akin to the reaction seen in the UK in 2022 after the government announced unfunded tax cuts (see Trump Risks More Liz Truss Moments). <br> Both scenarios are possible, but the second one is more likely. While the tariff situation is fluid, it seems they will settle somewhere between the April 2 reciprocal rates (call it a worst-case scenario) and current rates (which is probably fairly close to a best-case <br> scenario, with most countries already at the new baseline of 10%, though there is room for improvement if the fentanyl-related tariffs on China are dropped). The Yale Budget Lab estimates that if all new tariffs imposed in 2025 were made permanent at current rates, the US government would raise roughly US$2.3trn over 10 years, including dynamic effects that change economic behavior. If negotiations go poorly and tariffs revert to April 2 rates, this <br> would increase revenues by an estimated US$2.5trn over 10 years - again accounting for dynamic revenue effects. For now, it seems reasonable to expect tariffs to increase revenues by around US$2.3-2.5trn over the coming decade. <br> Turning to the budget. The CBO currently estimates, before incorporating new tariffs or budget changes, that US budget deficits will remain roughly flat at around 6% of GDP for the next 10 years, with only a decline to around 5% in the coming few years due to the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts, which is thereafter reversed due to rising interest costs. For simplicity, think of the current baseline impact on budget deficits, on a 10-year horizon, as <br> roughly flat. <br> [Quan trọng:] As noted, tariffs will contract deficits. Domestic tax cuts will increase them. Will the domestic budget increase deficits by more than US$2.5trn over 10 years? Quite likely. <br> It is possible that deficits contract in the current year, due to increased tariff revenues and before some of the new tax cuts go into effect. That could provide a temporary drag on growth, but in this piece we are focused primarily on the long-term fiscal outlook and will do a more careful analysis of the very near term after we get more details. <br> The independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that if all temporary provisions in the latest House budget draft were made permanent they would add US$5.2trn to deficits in the next 10 years. Fiscal hawks in the House want more <br> spending cuts, but some Republicans from high-tax states want to lift the deduction for state and local taxes further - which would further crimp the Federal tax take. The Senate <br> also tends to favor less spending cuts, and more deficits. We will have to monitor how talks proceed, but for now, the second scenario - of expanding deficits - seems the more likely long-term US fiscal outlook.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R25" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">26</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/20/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3057px;left:-1px">KHÔNG CHỈ VIẾT BÌNH LUẬN, LÀM BÁO CŨNG CẦN TRÍ NHỚ….<br> Nhờ đó sẽ cười ha hả khi đọc trên To The Point tin tức và hình ảnh lãnh tụ Cu Ba Cu Bốn lù lù trong cõi âm mà… chết không được! <br> Bao giờ sẽ tới Putin khi cánh tả tại Mỹ vẫn chưa thổ tả và đòi (như ghi tên tờ NY Times) “we do the thinking for you”? <br> Đọc đến đây lại cười phá: trí thức cánh tả của Mỹ đúng là chồn cáo, chỉ biết giật lùi!

A little over three weeks before (November 😎, Donald Trump stunned the world being elected President, and now the Babylon Bee couldn’t help celebrating both that and Castro croaking on November 25. For me, it was an opportunity to discuss why those on the Left so often have a compulsion to worship the worst of humanity rather than the finest.]<br> It was the summer of 1992. Our youngest son, Jackson, had been born in May, and I was staying put, not traveling anywhere to remain at home to help Rebel take care of him.<br> A friend of mine named Ray Kline called. Ray was a legendary intel guy in Washington, having been the Deputy Director of the CIA under John Kennedy, and later Director of the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency at the Pentagon).<br> It was Ray Kline who, in the fall of 1962, drove down the George Washington Parkway from Langley CIA headquarters to the White House, entered the Oval Office, and placed the satellite photos of the Soviet missile emplacements in Cuba on Kennedy’s desk to personally explain them to the President of the United States.<br> That’s how the Cuban Missile Crisis began.<br> Ray was calling to tell me about a 30th anniversary conference of the veterans of the Crisis he had just come back from. The conference was in Havana, Cuba.<br> “You went to Cuba, Ray?” I asked, amazed. “Jack, the Soviet Union has vanished off the map [December 1991] and a lot of Castro’s people are nervous” he replied. “They are trying to convince him to make his peace with the US. They even asked me if I knew of a conservative organization that would send a delegation to Havana and talk to them.”<br> Ray paused for effect. “I suggested you and your Freedom Research Foundation.”<br> “You’ve got to be kidding, Ray,” was all I could say.<br> “Jack, Cuban intel knows all about how you instigated the Reagan Doctrine, which is why they no longer have their Soviet patron. Who better than you to go and see if they are for real?”<br> I told him I would think about it. I decided to go and told Rebel, my reason: “I want to look Fidel Castro in the eye and tell him that someday the Cuban people will urinate on his grave.”<br> She decided to go with me – in order to prevent me from doing any such thing.<br> Thus it was in October of 1992, with my Mom looking after little Jackson, that Rebel, our oldest son Brandon (just turned 😎, a group of donors to the Freedom Research Foundation, and I went to Cuba.<br> Most countries run by a dictator are ubiquitously festooned with pictures of their Dear Leader - like Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe or North Korea with the Kims.<br> So the very first thing I noticed in Cuba is that Castro was invisible: No pictures, statues, huge posters or other depictions of him anywhere. There were only billboards and signs with the Slogan of the Revolution: Socialismo o Muerte – Socialism or Death.<br> Not once did I see the rebellious defacement the sign was begging for: the “o” scratched out and replaced with “es” – Socialism is Death.<br> Walking down a street in Havana, Rebel and I came upon a middle-aged man engaged in make-shift repairs on his bicycle. Fluent in Spanish, Rebel struck up a conversation with him. I noticed the bike was made in China and had a label in English: “Forever.”<br> When Rebel asked him about his bike, he said it was no good. Trying to make our talk light-hearted, I said, “Tell him the bike is called Forever.” Rebel translated his reply: “Nothing is forever.”<br> I couldn’t help myself. Instantly I said, “Like Fidel Castro.”<br> When the man heard Rebel say this in Spanish, he was not startled nor fearful. Instead his eyes went blank, glazed over with utter incomprehension. He simply could not conceive of a Cuba without Castro.<br> The Castros rule through a secret police and informer network who are everywhere and look like everyone else – the “government in the crowd.” But at this moment, there was no one nearby who could overhear our conversation. And there didn’t need to be.<br> Castro rule and constant presence have been internalized by Cubans. Their lives have been controlled for so many years, he has turned them into a nation of obedient robots.<br> You could see it in this man’s eyes, in the eyes of the Cuban people in general. The lights are on, but nobody is home. They have checked out.<br> Last Friday (11/25) at age 90, Fidel Castro finally croaked. Cuban-Americans danced in the streets of Miami. Liberals mourned. A mystery that has puzzled me for almost 60 years rose again to confront me.<br> When I was 14 years old in 1958, my father was able to take my family to Moscow on a filming assignment. Our Intourist guide was named Valya. She took us to Red Square where I was entranced by the fabulous St. Basil’s Cathedral built 400 years ago by Russia’s first Czar, Ivan the Terrible (1530-1584), and named after an eccentric Russian saint known as Basil the Blessed (1468-1552).<br> Then we went to Lenin’s Tomb.<br> On the Kremlin side of Red Square, it housed the waxy embalmed corpse of the Soviet Union’s founder, Vladimir Lenin, who died in 1924 – and that of Joseph Stalin as well, who had died just a few years ago in 1953. (Stalin’s corpse was removed from Lenin’s tomb on the order of Nikita Khrushchev in 1961, and buried some 300 feet away under the Kremlin wall.)<br> A huge line of Russians, hundreds of people, waited their turn to enter and see the corpses encased in glass displays.<br> Valya took us to the front of the line, as we were “foreign guests.” Everyone from the guards to the people in line to Valya were so reverential, as if this were a holy, sacred place. There was complete silence as we entered the tomb with a number of Russians and proceeded past the two bodies under glass, nobody making the slightest sound. It was impossibly creepy.<br> It was also hard for me not to laugh. All over Moscow we had seen huge statues of Lenin and Stalin, making them look like giants towering above the rest of us mere pygmies. Yet I had learned in the research I’d done back home that they were not much taller than midgets – Lenin was five-foot-one, while Stalin was under five-four[i].<br> What really got to me was all the pretending that these two monsters were moral giants. What would the world think of Germans flocking to the tomb of Hitler, with Hitler’s body on display under glass and worshipped?<br> I was only 14, yet I knew that these men had murdered millions, that they were among the most evil men who had ever lived, that they were moral equivalents of Hitler. The reverential silence, the worship of evil, displayed by these Russians all around me as we slowly shuffled past their corpses was terrifying and mysterious. Suddenly, I didn’t want to laugh.<br> When we came out again onto Red Square, I felt overwhelmed by a question: Why would people worship evil?<br> Why would they worship monsters as heroes, monsters who took away their freedom, who slaughtered and starved them, put them in concentration camps, caused them to live a life of fear?<br> The question puzzles me to this day. I saw one answer in the eyes of Cubans in Havana: helplessness.<br> When people feel helpless, they submit. An old aphorism explains this exactly: “When you have a man by the balls, his heart and mind will follow.”<br> But… why do Russians today, 25 years after the extinction of the Soviet Union, continue to line up in droves every day to pay Zombie Reverence to the monster in Lenin’s Tomb?<br> Why do they continue to worship evil when they are under no compulsion to do so?<br> Even more puzzling is affluent and free liberals in America worshipping evil.<br> It’s no puzzle seeing many of the world’s fascist scumbags show up to pay homage to their dead hero in Havana. But why does the BBC or USA Today headline them as “World Leaders”?<br> Why would NBC’s Andrea Mitchell be in tears over her “revered” Castro’s death, or ABC’s Jim Avila compare him to George Washington? Why did so much of the US media have a love affair with Castro for more than a half-century?<br> Not all liberals worship evil. In Richard Cohen’s On The Left column yesterday (11/29), he condemned Obama’s citing “the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation.” Cohen’s acid retort:<br>  “If individual lives were altered by torture, imprisonment, execution or mere harassment then I suppose the president is on to something and once again using language creatively. But this is thin gruel for Castro’s victims, some of whom might have expected the president of the United States to acknowledge their suffering. Alas, they got nothing.”<br> In the Washington Post (11/26), Dr. Carlos Eire, Riggs Professor of History at Yale University denounced the “Kafkaesque moral disequilibrium” affecting so many of his academic colleagues regarding Castro, listing 13 of his horrors that should be etched onto his tombstone.<br> They are the exceptions that “proves” (meaning “tests”) the rule of liberals rooting for America’s enemies. That’s virtually a defining characteristic of liberals – to be so embarrassed over America’s success in world history that they are on the side of anyone anti-American no matter how evil.<br> The good news is that very soon we will no longer have a liberal embarrassed-to-be-American president, and instead have a president who will make liberals everywhere, from the media to academia to Hollywood, irrelevant.<br> Within hours of the announcement of Castro’s death, President-elect Donald Trump issued this statement:<br>  “Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.<br> “While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.<br> “Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.”<br> This is exactly how a real American President would describe the death of an evil monster. At last, we have a president of whom we can be proud of once again.<br> Which is why we no longer have to mind if liberals worship evil. We no longer have to mind because they no longer matter.<br> __ <br> Ps: No, we didn’t get to meet Fidel, who sacked his underlings for inviting us. Rebel was relieved.<br> [i] Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, who adopted the made-up pseudonym of Lenin, was five-one according to British Marxist historian of the Soviet Union, Eric Hobsbawn.

Currently, earnings sit just over 14% for Q1. With market volatility in April effectively forcing a truce on hard trade stances globally, deregulation and the potential for a tax bill are now on the horizon, both of which are favorable for markets. The question will be whether Q2 earnings, with all that volatility reflected, will show something different, and whether employment will start to weaken as a result. So, all that aside, why is sentiment so low with most feeling worse off over the past 5 years than otherwise? One reason is purchasing power; another is the wealth divide.<br> * Netting out the violence of data swings during the peak of the pandemic, and looking from June of 2020 until today, purchasing power has eroded with inflation. The cumulative effect of inflation over that period moved prices higher by 24.6%. Average hourly earnings did rise every year as well, but at a slower pace, a cumulative 22.7%. That said, this excludes government transfer payments and anything related to accretion to total net worth. <br> In other words, while real wages slipped, home equity is higher, investment balances (401(k)s, IRAs, etc.) are higher, and savings balances are higher. To put that in perspective, total US net worth in June of 2020 was $60T, and it is roughly $170T today. <br> [Then chốt:] This, of course, helps wealthy folks much more than non-wealthy, which is why the conversation of wealth divide is just as important a topic as real wage growth (or decline) in the past 5 years in explaining why most feel left out. <br> This phenomenon has been occurring for a generation, and not just in the US, but much of the developed world. I would argue this has more to do with the global populist political era today than almost anything else. <br> Ask TBG:<br>  I have noticed that there is usually a comment in the newsletters about expected rate cuts by the Fed. And the expectations bounce around quite a bit. Why is this significant for investment purposes that it deserves so much mention? Thanks.~ Rod M.<br> There is a dichotomy about what the Fed futures tell us about where Monetary policy is headed, as well as the economy. Market participants monitor these for glimpses into where asset prices may move, and what they say about loose or restrictive policy in response to increasing or decreasing economic activity and inflation. Monetary policy itself has implications for liquidity, lending rates (mortgage, auto, credit card), the entire fixed income market, inflation expectations and economic growth. Do I think too much attention is paid to the Fed and monetary policy? Yes, I do. <br> However, because the world we now live in involves a larger role of the Fed than was ever dreamed, the direction of policy in advance (Fed Futures) is more widely watched. Monetary Policy has become more than just an adjustment of short-term lending rates based on a dual mandate of supporting stable prices and full employment. <br> The dramatic shift post-GFC, utilizing the power of the Fed balance sheet to be the buyer of last resort during a liquidity crisis, has morphed this simple mandate into an effective perpetual ‘put’ on market volatility. The benefit in the short run may be some perceived safety net, and the travesty over any other longer period is the erosion or at least interference of efficient capital markets. Simply put, capital market movement is now more sensitive to this data, so the investment purposes of paying attention to it all are just that. It should never drive investment decisions in and of itself; fundamentals and individual investor goals should, but it&#39;s pertinent, nonetheless.~ Brian T.

W. Norton &amp; Company, 2025)<br> OVERVIEW<br> Dr. Hal Brands, a professor of American history and foreign policy at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, has written a useful and significant study of the international system from 1900 through the first quarter of the 21st century. The volume may be divided into three interrelated themes.<br> First, Brands rapidly traces the history of democratic versus autocratic geopolitical thought for the general reader. Halford Mackinder, Alfred Thayer Mahan, and Nicholas Spykman - the defenders of Western democracies - and Major General Karl Haushofer and Aleksandr Dugin - the proponents of Eurasian autocracies - each receive an appropriate mention. However, it is the work of Halford Mackinder that receives pride of place for having predicted the essential feature of the hot and cold wars of the modern world: In short, the offshore maritime powers of Great Britain, and later the United States, sought to maintain the balance of power in Eurasia. Why? To ensure that no one power or alliance of land-based powers would manage to unify Eurasia, thereby gaining undisputed access to the manpower and resources of that supercontinent. Such access would allow a unified Eurasia to build fleets that could threaten the thalassocracies of Great Britain and the U.S.<br> The second theme, a historical treatment of the hot wars and cold wars that erupted across Eurasia since the dawn of the twentieth century, comprises the bulk of Brand’s book. Approximately 40 pages is devoted to the origins, course, and consequences of World War I, World War II, the Cold War between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S., and the second Cold War between the P.R.C. and the U.S. These four chapters are strategic histories, as Colin Gray would have characterized them, rather than general histories of each period. The author elaborates the grand strategies of the protagonists, discusses military campaigns, evaluates the strategic dilemmas that decision makers attempted to resolve during their respective conflicts, and considers the consequences, intended and otherwise, of defeat or victory.<br> Third, Brands ends his book with policy recommendations. He draws these recommendations from how Great Britain and the United States managed to emerge victorious in the first three conflicts. The maritime powers frequently delayed addressing the dangers presented by the Eurasian autocracies - their quest for more territory, more manpower, more resources, more power - until it was almost too late. Brands suggests it is critical to maintain strong alliances to contain and deter such adversaries. Furthermore, military capability must be cultivated to issue timely and credible threats. The goal: keep Eurasia internally divided.<br> In effect, our current danger grew out of the fact that the United States assumed that, after the Cold War, liberal democracy was the wave of the future. However, the diffusion of our values and institutions depended not merely on the prestige that victory over the U.S.S.R. conferred on the United States, but more significantly on the maintenance of military capability. Reliance on a “rules based international order” is woefully insufficient in maintaining the hard power needed to guarantee national security. Furthermore, post-cold war hegemonic power of the United States prompted China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, despite their ideological differences, to eventually team up.[1] These revisionist powers seek to make the world safe for empire, their empires. Grey zone conflicts, proxy wars, and the threat of war have occurred across the Eurasian rimland.<br> CARTOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATIONS OF STRATEGIC HISTORY<br> There is much to recommend this book, not the least of which is the reintroduction of classical geopolitical theory to the general reader. Brands deserves applause for having done so as a way of making sense of our current situation. Many faculty will adopt this book as a secondary reading in advanced courses in the fields of American foreign policy, strategy, and national security. <br> Nevertheless, there is one troubling and obvious oversight that should be highlighted: The general reader and the student will search in vain for maps drawn specifically to highlight classical geopolitical thought and Brands’ geohistorical arguments. A historical atlas will need to be purchased and carefully interpreted to get the most out of The Eurasian Century.<br> Furthermore, while one should never judge a book by its cover, perhaps it is legitimate to judge a cover by the themes presented in a book. The cover of Brands’ book depicts three Eurasian maps along a horizontal timeline, ~1890 to ~2030. In the first, overlaid on the timeline from ~1890 to 1930-1945, Central and Western Europe are highlighted, presumably as the Eurasian geopolitical cockpit of the period; in the third, 1978-1992 to ~2030, China, Taiwan, and the territories along the southern and western borders of China are highlighted as the new flashpoint. But what about the map of Eurasia that corresponds to the period 1930-1945 through 1978-1992?<br> Given the thesis of the book, a reader might expect to see the territory of the U.S.S.R. and the Warsaw Pact highlighted - that is the power that threatened the stability of Eurasia during the Cold War. Instead, the territory of the Indian subcontinent (including Pakistan and Bangladesh) is highlighted! What? How did this cartographic error occur? Publishers, not authors, frequently have control over what book covers depict; yet, given this egregious mistake, did the publisher miss the point of the book? Why didn’t the author demand that the central map be changed to reflect the Soviet threat?<br> Maps in a book about geopolitics do not merely adorn the argument. They should, at the very least, depict the locations mentioned in the text, saving the reader from having to constantly consult a historical atlas. However, to be truly effective, maps should offer a visual display of strategic concepts, highlight theoretically relevant locations where military conflicts begin, intensify, and are resolved, and indicate the relationship of process to critical locations, such as international commerce to maritime chokepoints.[2]<br> GEOGRAPHY, EURASIA, AND MACKINDER’S HEARTLAND THESIS<br> The cartography on the cover is indicative of some deeper issues. Let’s start with the basics. Geographers frequently characterize regions as either “uniform” in nature or “functional.” A uniform region is characterized by its one essential and significant characteristic - for instance, an “industrial” region - to enable a comparison with another, different uniform region - such as an “agricultural” region. Brands frequently deploys “Eurasia” as a “uniform” region.[3] Why?<br> Brands may believe that the China-Russia-Iran-North Korea proto-alliance gives rise to a politically uniform region in which autocracy is the most salient characteristic. Or he may believe that the Trans-Siberian Railroad, when connected to the various transportation projects promoted by China under the Belt and Road and other infrastructure initiatives, has produced or will soon produce a single economic unit in Eurasia. Or he may have emphasized Europe and Asia as a unified source of danger to the United States as distinct from the China challenge in the Indo-Pacific region.[4] Geography is often gerrymandered for political purposes. These three points are mere speculation.<br> A fourth possibility is that Brands is simplifying his geographic terminology to appeal to an audience of general readers that, in the words of the old rock and roll song, “don’t know much about geography…” Turning to the text, Brands suggests that Mackinder’s stunning 1904 presentation on “The Geographical Pivot of History”[5] combined vague abstraction, meandering narration, distant history, and mountains of geographical detail. The talk featured a long, if graceful, discussion of rivers, steppes, peaks and monsoon lands; it was full of concepts (“Pivot Area,” “Inner Crescent,” “Outer Crescent”) that then probably seemed obscure.[6]<br> Mackinder was addressing an audience of geographers and imperial policy makers, most of whom knew where the Ural Mountains, Manchuria, the Volga River, etc. were to be found. Did Mackinder depict his “obscure” concepts with maps? According to Dr. Brian Blouet, Mackinder’s biographer, Mackinder “illustrated” his talk, probably to identify the location where his concepts applied to Eurasian and world history.[7] In the published version of “The Geographical Pivot of History,” Mackinder deployed five figures, the fifth of which explicitly showed the locations of these supposedly “obscure” concepts.[8]<br> So, how does Hal Brands define Eurasia? Much depends on this definition, as “Eurasia” is not visualized in a map, even though it is his key unit of geographic analysis.<br> As the name implies, Eurasia consists of the combined expanse of those two Old World continents of the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia. It includes the outlying islands of those continents, which are closely connected to them by Eurasia’s marginal seas, as well as North Africa, which is thoroughly linked to Europe by the Mediterranean as it is blocked from the rest of Africa by the Sahara. Eurasia thus runs from littoral Asia in the East to the Iberian Peninsula and the British Isles in the West, from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Indian Ocean in the south. This “world island,” as geographer Halford Mackinder called it, is a space unlike any other.[9]<br> All but the last sentence in this characterization is correct.<br> In his masterpiece Democratic Ideals and Reality,[10] Mackinder defines the “world-island” as comprised of six (uniform) subregions: (1) the Sahara, (2) the Southern Heartland,[11] south of sub-Saharan Africa, (3) Arabia, (4) the Monsoon Coastlands (of India, Southwest Asia, and China), (5) the “European Coastland,” and finally - Mackinder’s particular contribution to our understanding of geopolitics of the 20th and the first quarter of the 21st century - (6) the “Heartland.” Thus, despite Brands’ assertion that the boundaries of the “world-island” are conterminous with Eurasia, Mackinder includes in the world-island two subregions that fall outside of Eurasia.[12] This may seem to be a mere geographical technicality, but details matter, especially when it comes to what constitutes Brands’ key unit of analysis, Eurasia, which he argues is a regional “prize without equal: it is the strategic center of the world.”[13]<br> Halford Mackinder, when characterizing the world-island, did so as a “functional” region, that is, one in which the humans living in the subregions interacted with one another economically, socially, and militarily. At the strategic center of the world-island is the Geographic Pivot, occupied by Tsarist Russia, and later termed the Eurasian Heartland. In 1904 Mackinder asked,<br> Is not the pivot region of the world&#39;s politics that vast area of Euro-Asia which is inaccessible to ships, but in antiquity lay open to the horse-riding nomads, and is to-day about to be covered with a network of railways? There have been and are here the conditions of a mobility of military and economic power of a far-reaching and yet limited character. Russia replaces the Mongol Empire. Her pressure on Finland, on Scandinavia, on Poland, on Turkey, on Persia, on India, and on China, replaces the centrifugal raids of the steppemen [sic]. In the world at large she occupies the central strategical position held by Germany in Europe. She can strike on all sides and be struck from all sides, save the north. The full development of her modern railway mobility is merely a matter of time.[14]<br> Russia, as the “Pivot” or Heartland power, exerts pressure on the lands along its borders; however, as the Heartland power, it was relatively immune from the influence of maritime power due to rivers flowing to inland seas or the Arctic, and the way the polar ice cap limited the movement of shipping. With the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, Russia acquired not merely the means to access virgin agricultural land and new mineral resources, but also internal lines of communication, travel, and transport - factors essential for rapidly moving and deploying military force. For Mackinder, the Tsarist regime threatened to overturn the balance of power in Europe and beyond by suddenly transforming the territory of the Eurasian Heartland into an economically modern and politically unified new environment.<br> Hal Brands, in emphasizing Eurasia as his unit of geographic analysis, rarely mentions Mackinder’s Heartland thesis. Surprisingly, The Eurasian Century fails to note the Heartland in the index - either as a separate term or under Mackinder’s name. Yet, in one critical passage, Brands mentions the Heartland. He quotes, in an abbreviated fashion, Mackinder’s geopolitical catechism: “Who rules the Heartland rules the World-Island; whoever rules the World-Island commands the World.”[15] Yet here too, Brands misses Mackinder’s deeper point, which is suggested by the full quote from Democratic Ideals and Reality:<br> Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland:<br> Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island:<br> Who rules the World-Island commands the World.[16]<br> Why does East Europe loom so large in Mackinder’s formulation in Democratic Ideals and Reality? First, East Europe was the land over which Germanic and Slavic peoples competed - one of the fundamental causes of World War I for Mackinder. Second, East Europe was (and remains) the gateway to the Heartland. The Northern European plain and the Danube Basin provide the two major land-based invasion routes into the Heartland. Third, in Democratic Ideals and Reality, Mackinder reformulated the Heartland thesis from a geographic region into a strategic region, where the great European autocratic powers threaten the lands along the littorals of the Baltic and Black seas.[17]<br> Finally, Mackinder envisioned Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Great Bohemia, Hungary, Great Rumania, Bulgaria, Great Serbia, and Greece[18] as: (1) a make weight against the revival of German power, (2) a bulwark, keeping the post-war Russian Communist regime outside of Europe, and (3) the foundation for a restored European balance of power. One curiosity: although Ukraine is not explicitly mentioned in the text, it does appear (without territorial boundaries) on Mackinder’s map depicting Eastern Europe.[19] In short, the Wilsonian ideals of national self-determination of the East European states and collective security through the League of Nations needed to be brought into alignment with the realities of power. In Mackinder’s vision, these newly independent nations would align with France and Great Britain, thereby putting the League on a sound footing and restoring a balance of power to Europe.<br> According to Brands, “For Mackinder, then the most critical feature of the peace was not the League of Nations. It was the creation of a cordon sanitaire between Russia and Germany - a ‘tier of independent states’ that, in defending themselves, would keep Eurasia in balance.”[20] This interpretation is correct, but not quite good enough. For Mackinder, the independent states of East Europe, once allied with the democratic and maritime powers of Western Europe, would restore the balance of power and thereby stabilize the League as a mechanism for collective security.<br> Mackinder was not a modern “realist.”[21] He recognized that ideals, such as liberty, equality, and nationalism, had historically become institutionalized as features of reality.[22] Even collective security was on the verge of becoming institutionalized when Mackinder wrote. Such ideals needed to be considered when formulating a foreign policy designed to restructure the international order in the aftermath of World War I. Therefore, the fundamental issue for Mackinder wasn’t ideals versus the reality of power in the international arena; instead, it was how to reconcile democratic ideals with the reality of power. The title of Mackinder book was not Democratic Ideals or Reality.<br> Mackinder’s Democratic Ideals and Realty was written in recognition that post-World War I democratic populations were being carried away by an overly optimistic idea of what collective security could accomplish. A correction was needed; Mackinder supplied it by imagining a new geopolitical order that mobilized many of the hitherto submerged ethnic groups of the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and German empires as autonomous nation-states.[23]<br> Brands alludes to the importance of East Europe when he evaluates the geopolitical ideas of Major General Dr. Karl E. Haushofer, the thinker whose ideas are often associated with the rise of Adolph Hitler. According to Brands: “The world, wrote Haushofer, needed ‘a general political cleaning up, a redistribution of power.’ The young Eastern European countries lying athwart Germany’s path were ‘state fragments’ that ‘have no longer a right to exist.’”[24] Brands is no doubt correct in interpreting Haushofer’s sentiment toward the East European states as a quest for lebensraum.<br> But it was more than just that. Haushofer’s attack on the legitimacy of the East European nations as mere “fragments” of states was tantamount to an assault on the inter-war balance of power, which was upheld by the alliances led by France and Great Britain. In the absence of a full-blown interpretation of Mackinder’s purpose in writing Democratic Ideals and Reality, Brands cannot provide a nuanced appreciation of Haushofer’s geopolitical thought and rhetorical tactics.<br> CONCLUSION<br> In the final analysis, Hal Brands’ book deserves to be read and discussed among students of international relations and within the foreign policy establishment. However, it does not do justice to the subtleties of classical geopolitical thought. At times, the geography in geopolitics is suppressed in favor of an aspatial assessment of great power competition and conflict. Brand’s failure to provide cartographic visualizations of strategic interactions is a telling aspect of how the geographic component in geopolitics is obscured.<br> Indeed, had Hal Brands attended to Mackinder’s overriding goal in Democratic Ideals and Reality - how to reconcile the enthusiasms and ideals of democracies with the geopolitical realities of power in international relations - he might have offered a more nuanced appreciation of how ideology and geopolitics should interact in the formulation of foreign policy. While he is undoubtedly correct that “ideology and geopolitics are inseparable,”[25] this assertion is an insufficient guide to where, under what conditions, and at what cost maritime-commercial powers should ally with a territorial-autocratic regime of the Heartland to keep Eurasia divided.<br> Acknowledgements: The author thanks Paul Rahe, Jim Sheehan, Kelly Jordan, Geoff Sloan and Michael Hochberg for their comments.

Photo: Alex Brandon/Associated Press<br> Along with the big house and a legacy, every self-respecting president likes to have a doctrine. Since James Monroe gave his name to one, most presidents have sought to codify formally or informally their engagement with the world beyond U.S. shores into a set of principles that provides a blueprint for a coherent foreign policy. (Teddy Roosevelt had to make do with a corollary rather than a full doctrine, but that didn’t stop him from being among the more consequential presidents.)<br> Presidential doctrine is both rhetorical and empirical, carefully crafted in speeches that capture the administration’s intentions and aspirations, and executed in presidential action. In his 1985 State of the Union address, Ronald Reagan pithily captured his doctrine with the claim that “Support for freedom fighters is self-defense.” He exemplified it with active assistance to anticommunists from Kabul to Managua.<br> The problem with trying to identify a Trump Doctrine is that, as with so much about this most unique of American leaders, there’s no guarantee of consistency from one day to the next - either rhetorically or empirically. Take the largest strategic question that confronts the U.S. for the next generation at least: Are we trying to decouple from China? A month ago it seemed an all-out tariff war would more or less end U.S.-Chinese economic interdependence. With last week’s cease-fire, the administration is touting opportunities with Beijing again.<br> Last week in Saudi Arabia we got as clear a verbal and practical account of a Trump Doctrine as we have had since he first took office eight years ago. It was the familiar deal-making president but with the style raised to the level of strategy on a scale we haven’t seen before, and it was clearly, on his terms, a big success.<br> When discussing the promises of foreign potentates it is always hard to disentangle realizable commitment from sycophantic mendacity, and all U.S. presidents inflate the actual value of deals they strike on these visits, so some of the tales told of investments and trade to come from this trip were taller than a petrostate skyscraper. But even if you don’t believe the $2 trillion in “great deals” the White House claimed from the trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, there isn’t much doubt that, along with a lot of royal pomp and circumstance of the sort he loves, Mr. Trump got some genuine bargains for the U.S. economy.<br> “Trade follows the flag” was the term that captured British foreign-policy doctrine at the peak of its empire: Commercial opportunity would follow from the country’s pursuit of diplomatic, military and strategic objectives. Mr. Trump’s approach seems like a characteristic inversion: The flag follows trade.<br> His vision appears to be making the top priority economic relations, allied to a ruthless pursuit of national interest shorn of idealism, as laid out in his big speech in Riyadh. It is an unusual mix of materialism and foreign-policy realism - <br> “mater-realism” perhaps.<br> You can see the logic behind it. He isn’t wrong that successive American presidents’ pursuit of high-minded ideals has often failed twice over. In the Middle East especially, they didn’t achieve their objectives of greater freedom, peace and stability for the region and security for the U.S., and the efforts came at large cost to Americans. Why not drop the failed idealism and chase the dollars? It not only enhances America’s economic power with valuable trade and investment; it advances our strategic interests too.<br> Look at China for inspiration: While U.S. administrations have sought regime change and democracy in the Middle East and elsewhere, China steadily executed a less preachy and less expensive economics-based approach to strategic advancement. The biggest deal Mr. Trump pulled off last week might have been to start rolling back decades of Beijing’s influence-expansion.<br> With Mr. Trump and his family there is always the added appeal of a little personal enrichment to skim something off the top. A crypto-fund billion or two here, a $400 million dollar plane there, and pretty soon you’re talking serious money. “Baksheesh” the locals call it, but to use our own more recently developed, vernacular, it looks a lot like “10% for the Big Guy.” Mr Trump wouldn’t be the first president to use his position for financial gain; allies would say he’s just better at it and that in any case, since it’s all public, the risk of corrupt influence is minimized. The Emoluments Clause of the Constitution begs to differ.<br> The principal risk of Mr. Trump’s mater-realism is that economic and strategic interests aren’t always aligned. Take his effort at détente with Iran. This seems prompted at least in part by a desire to reward the regime in Riyadh, which has been steadily improving relations with Tehran over the past few years. Or his decision to lift sanctions on Syria and meet with its new president. Mr. Trump may have found Ahmed al Sharaa “young, attractive and tough,” but not long ago he was fighting a terrorist war against the U.S. in Iraq. This too seems to have been prompted in part by Saudi interests. Is any of this really going to keep the region secure and America safe?<br> High-flown idealism has certainly come at a price, but money won’t buy you peace and security either.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R29" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">30</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2857px;left:-1px">VÀI SỰ THẬT VỀ QUỸ CỨU TRỢ Y TẾ MEDICAID<br> Hội đồng Biên tập I&amp;I trình bày thực trạng của quỹ cứu trợ y tế Medicaid mà nhiều người có thể không nắm vững.

They’re cutting health care for the poor to pay for tax cuts for the rich! Millions will lose coverage! The disabled will suffer! Oh, the humanity!<br> Well, if the GOP is going to be accused of destroying Medicaid when all they are proposing is a minor haircut, why not go all out and scrap this hopelessly flawed, fraud-riddled, budget-busting disaster of a program and start over from scratch?<br> First, let’s dispense with the claim of “devastating” cuts to Medicaid. The House reconciliation bill would reduce Medicaid spending by $625 billion. That might sound like a lot, but it’s stretched out over 10 years, at a time when Medicaid is on track to spend $8.6 trillion. Medicaid spending will still go up every year under the House bill, just a tiny bit more slowly.<br> What Republicans should really be talking about is giving Medicaid the USAID treatment. Shut it down and start over from scratch.<br> Let’s line up the reasons.<br> It was sold on a lie. The original claim made in the mid-1960s was that the federal government and the states would split the cost of Medicaid. But that happened only once: in the program’s first year. Ever since, the federal share has grown while the states’ shares have shrunk. By 2005, states were paying only 42% of Medicaid’s bills. In 2022, the state share dipped below 30%.<br> Over the past 60 years, states have pressured federal lawmakers to make a multitude of exceptions to the 50-50 split, which lawmakers were only too happy to provide because there is no cap on federal Medicaid spending.<br> It is ripe for waste and fraud. This financing scheme, in turn, gives states little incentive to run their programs efficiently. Why should they? They are paying only a fraction of the costs. Plus, for every dollar of waste or fraud a state eliminates, it loses even more money from the feds.<br> “Official government reports conservatively estimate that improper Medicaid payments total half a trillion dollars over the last decade, but outside estimates place that figure closer to $1.1 trillion,” notes the Cato Institute’s Dominik Lett.<br> In other words, just cutting out waste and fraud would more than cover the “cuts” the GOP is proposing.<br> But that will never happen so long as states are paying pennies on the dollar for Medicaid.<br> States use Medicaid to steal federal money. On top of this, as we pointed out in this space earlier, states also figured out how to game the system through “provider taxes.” The way it works is that states impose a special tax on Medicaid providers, boost Medicaid reimbursement rates to cover the cost of the tax, and then send the bill to Congress. Congress has tried to rein in this abuse, but to no avail.<br> Back in 2011, when Joe Biden was vice president and more mentally capable, he called this a scam, said states were gaming the system, and said there was no reason for Congress not to stop it. The Congressional Budget Office says the 10-year cost of this one racket is $600 billion – almost exactly what the GOP wants to cut. (See “Dems Fight To Protect A $600 Billion Medicaid Tax Scam That Joe Biden Tried To Kill.”)<br> Spending is out of control. It should come as no surprise, then, that Medicaid spending is exploding. Over the past 10 years, Medicaid’s costs have gone up by more than 68%. They are on track to climb another 56% over the next 10 years.<br> The quality of care is lousy. Even with these massive costs, quality of care is far from optimal. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey finds that more than half of Medicaid enrollees say they’ve had a problem with their insurance in the past year, with 26% saying they couldn’t get recommended care and 22% saying they experienced “significant” delays in getting care.<br> An NIH study found that “Medicaid patients have greater difficulty obtaining appointments compared with privately insured patients across a variety of medical scenarios.” An article in Health Affairs found that far fewer doctors were accepting new Medicaid patients than either Medicare or privately insured ones.<br> The reason is that Medicaid pays doctors less than either Medicare or private insurance, and piles on mountains of paperwork.<br> Tweaking the program won’t solve any of these problems.<br> The only real solution is to scrap Medicaid and figure out a 21st-century solution to providing quality health care to the nation’s poor.<br> An obvious first step would be to get the federal government out of the picture entirely.

Câu hỏi chí lý khiến ta nên chú ý…<br> https://thespectator.com/.../likely-joe-biden-prostate.../<br> ‘Highly likely’ Biden had prostate cancer diagnosis in the White House<br> Cancer expert Dr. Steven Quay believes it would constitute malpractice to only get such a diagnosis now<br> (By Dr. Steven Quay - The Spectator - Sunday, May 18, 2025)<br> Joe Biden<br> (Getty)<br> How does metastatic prostate cancer “suddenly” appear in someone like Joe Biden?<br> It doesn’t appear overnight, it festers. In rare but dangerous cases, prostate cancer bypasses the usual slow growth and strikes fast, especially in older men. If he wasn’t screened regularly, or had an aggressive subtype that evaded PSA detection, it could have advanced under the radar. But how can we imagine that a President was not screened properly?<br> Prostate cancer is the easiest cancer to diagnose. The PSA blood test shows the rate of cancer cell growth. Even with the most aggressive form, it is a 5-7 year journey without treatment before it becomes metastatic. Meaning, it would be malpractice for this patient to show up and be first diagnosed with metastatic disease in May 2025. It is highly likely he was carrying a diagnosis of prostate cancer throughout his White House tenure and the American people were uninformed.<br> Should it have been caught earlier?<br> Yes. Localized prostate cancer is often curable. Once it escapes the capsule and spreads, we shift from cure to containment. A missed or delayed diagnosis is a critical failure point.<br> Is this rare?<br> About 10-15 percent of prostate cancers are diagnosed first at stage IV, when it is in the bones like this is. Among men over 80, especially those with inconsistent screening, it’s more common. Again, for a president of the United States to be diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer is malpractice, in my opinion.<br> What is the modern treatment for metastatic prostate cancer, and what should patients expect in terms of side effects?<br> Today’s treatment for metastatic prostate cancer isn’t your grandfather’s medicine cabinet. It’s a high-tech playbook combining hormone suppression, precision radiation, smart drugs and sometimes immunotherapy. The first step usually shuts down testosterone, because this hormone fuels prostate cancer like gasoline on a fire. That’s done through drugs or injections called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Then, a second-line agent, think of it as a smarter missile, is added. Drugs like enzalutamide or abiraterone block the cancer’s ability to rewire itself and keep growing.<br> But this isn’t without cost. Common side effects include fatigue, hot flashes, weakened bones and a drop in sexual function. Some treatments can affect the liver or raise blood pressure. It’s a trade-off: extra years of life, but with closer medical supervision and adjustments along the way. Still, with today’s tools, many men live for years after diagnosis; active, engaged, and very much still in the fight.<br> Could political considerations, like running for re-election, have delayed treatment?<br> That’s the uncomfortable question. The 800-pound gorilla in the room. If early signs were dismissed or downplayed to maintain a campaign image, then yes, treatment could’ve been compromised. Every month matters with aggressive variants. Delaying biopsy, imaging, or therapy to protect political optics may have come at a steep biological price. This is speculation, of course.<br> The highest probability is that the diagnosis has been known for many years but a calculated decision was made to not announce it, not treat it, and hope after the re-election the treatment could be done when it was still a local disease. An unfortunate turn of events.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R31" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">32</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:1957px;left:-1px">“BIRTHRIGHT”, TRUMP và TỐI CAO PHÁP VIỆN<br> Tuần này, Tối Cao Pháp Viện Hoa Kỳ còn phân vân về hồ sơ Birthright do Chính quyền Trump quyết định qua một sắc lệnh hành pháp mà nhiều tòa án liên bang lại bác bỏ. <br> The Epoch Times tổng hợp một số chi tiết về bối cảnh cho các độc giả dễ theo dõi:<br> https://www.theepochtimes.com/.../supreme-court-weighs...<br> US - US News<br> Supreme Court Weighs Trump’s Birthright Citizenship Challenge<br> Trump’s challenge to the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment could change a 100-year precedent.<br> Supreme Court Weighs Trump’s Birthright Citizenship Challenge<br> A pregnant illegal immigrant from El Salvador stands next to a U.S. Border Patrol truck near Rio Grande City, Texas, on Dec. 7, 2015. John Moore/Getty Images<br> (By Stuart Liess - The Epoch Times - 5/19/2025)<br> The United States’ highest court this week seemed divided over whether lower court judges had overstepped their authority in blocking the Trump administration’s attempts to limit birthright citizenship.<br> Federal judges had put a nationwide block on President Donald Trump’s attempt to remove automatic citizenship status from children born in the United States to immigrants with noncitizen status.<br> The question at hand is whether the federal judges were allowed to do this. The Trump administration argues they do not, and have overstepped their jurisdiction in this matter.<br> The decision will also determine the limits of presidential power and whether a president can make such decisions, which will then determine the authority of judges in blocking Trump’s agenda on a much broader level in other cases where he is facing legal challenges.<br> The United States’ governance system is based on a series of checks and balances where the president enforces laws that Congress has made, and the Supreme Court interprets them and can even overrule them if it deems the laws unconstitutional.<br> Since Inauguration Day, Trump has signed 151 executive orders, which are directives by the president ordering the government to take specific actions. Their limitations, however, are that they cannot overrule existing federal law or statutes created by Congress.<br> President Joe Biden signed 162 executive orders during his term, and President Barack Obama signed 277 executive orders during his eight years of office. Trump signed a total of 220 during his entire first term.<br> Critics of Trump argue that he is overstepping his presidential authority on a number of decisions.<br> The president declared a national emergency on Jan. 20, vowing to solve the country’s illegal immigration crisis and fulfilling one of his campaign promises to stop an “invasion” at the border.<br> Trump has vowed to end “birth tourism,” in which he says illegal immigrants are giving birth in this country so that the children will be U.S. citizens.<br> According to Pew Research Center, the illegal immigrant population was at a 15-year high of 11 million in 2022, while border encounters have been soaring in recent years.<br> U.S. southern border apprehensions reached a high of 370,883 in December 2023, before dropping in 2024, according to Customs and Border Protection data.<br> The latest data recorded an 88 percent drop from the previous year, with 29,238 encounters in April this year falling from 247,929 around the same time in 2024.<br> Constitutional Reinterpretation<br> The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, addressing the citizenship rights of American-born former slaves.<br> Then in 1898, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Wong Kim Ark, who was born in the United States but was denied reentry after leaving to visit China. The justices said a child born in the United States became a citizen at birth. This set the precedent for birthright citizenship.<br> Trump argues that the amendment was misinterpreted, and the act of birthright citizenship doesn’t necessarily apply to all children born in the United States, particularly immigrants who entered unlawfully or people on a temporary visa.<br> The statement from the Constitution in question reads: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”<br> The president has argued that the phrase “the jurisdiction thereof” should be interpreted as meaning that the person has sworn allegiance to the country, and to qualify, one parent would need to be a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident.<br> The United States is one of about 30 countries that currently offer automatic citizenship by birth. Neighbouring Canada and Mexico do the same.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R32" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">33</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:11409px;left:-1px">UNDERSTANDING WAR TỔNG HỢP VỀ CHIẾN SỰ UKRAINE<br> Với nhiều chi tiết nên biết về tình hình của ngày hôm nay:<br> https://www.understandingwar.org/.../russian-offensive...<br> Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, May 19, 2025<br> May 19, 2025 - ISW Press<br> Christina Harward, Daria Novikov, Anna Harvey, Nicole Wolkov, Grace Mappes, and Kateryna Stepanenko<br> May 19, 2025, 5:30 pm ET<br> Click here to see ISW’s interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

ISW will cover subsequent reports in the May 20 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment.<br> US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call on May 19 to discuss ceasefire and peace negotiations regarding Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine. Trump stated that he and Putin agreed that Russia and Ukraine will immediately begin bilateral negotiations about both a ceasefire and a peace agreement.[1] Trump also said that he called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after his conversation with Putin and informed them that bilateral negotiations will begin immediately. Trump stated that the Vatican is &quot;very interested in hosting the negotiations.&quot; Trump also expressed interest in reviving US–Russian trade after Ukraine and Russia agree to a peace deal and said that Ukraine could also benefit from trade during the reconstruction process. Putin spoke to journalists following the call on May 19 and stated that he and Trump agreed that Russia would present Ukraine with a &quot;memorandum&quot; detailing conditions and timing for a future peace treaty as the two countries move toward conducting bilateral negotiations.[2] Putin also stated that Russia’s &quot;main&quot; concern is the elimination of the war’s &quot;root causes,&quot; reiterating a long-standing Kremlin narrative calling for the replacement of the current Ukrainian government with a Russian proxy government and Ukraine&#39;s commitment to neutrality.[3] Russian Presidential Aide Yuriy Ushakov told journalists on May 19 that Trump and Putin also discussed a possible nine-for-nine US–Russian prisoner exchange.[4]<br> Zelensky stated that he spoke with Trump before Trump&#39;s call with Putin and spoke with Trump, Macron, Meloni, Merz, Stubb, and von der Leyen following the Trump–Putin call.[5] Zelensky reaffirmed Ukraine&#39;s readiness for a full unconditional ceasefire as Trump has previously proposed. Zelensky stated that Ukraine is ready for direct negotiations with Russia &quot;in any format&quot; and offered Turkey, the Vatican, or Switzerland as possible venues for talks. Zelensky called for the negotiation process to involve both American and European representatives &quot;at the appropriate level.&quot; Russia must break its pattern of protracting negotiations and failing to offer any meaningful concessions to Ukraine in order for legitimate and good-faith negotiations to lead to a lasting and sustainable end to its war against Ukraine.<br> Russia must explicitly acknowledge the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and constitution and Ukraine&#39;s sovereignty in order to engage in meaningful, good-faith negotiations. Putin and other Kremlin officials have repeatedly falsely claimed that Zelensky is the illegitimate leader according to the Ukrainian Constitution and that all Ukrainian governments since 2014 are also illegitimate.[6] Ukraine&#39;s Constitution and law explicitly state that Ukraine cannot hold elections while martial law is in place and that Ukrainian authorities cannot lift martial law while &quot;the threat of attack or danger to the state independence of Ukraine and its territorial integrity&quot; remains.[7] Russia and Ukraine cannot engage in meaningful negotiations so long as Russia refuses to recognize the negotiating authority of Ukraine. Russian officials have forwarded the narrative about the Ukrainian government&#39;s alleged illegitimacy as recently as May 17, and ISW continues to assess that this Russian effort is aimed at setting conditions for Russia to renege on any future Ukrainian–Russian agreements at a time of Russia&#39;s choosing.[8] Any future peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine must include Russia&#39;s explicit recognition of the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and constitution.<br> Russia must agree that ceasefire negotiations must precede peace settlement negotiations. The United States, Ukraine, and Europe have repeatedly called for the establishment of a ceasefire to allow for diplomatic talks to end Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine to proceed.[9] Russia has consistently rejected this sequence of events as part of efforts to hold any ceasefire talks hostage to extract additional concessions from Ukraine and the West.[10] ISW continues to assess that Russia is committed to prolonging peace negotiations so as to continue making battlefield advances.[11] Peace talks ahead of an established ceasefire would allow Russia to continue to make advances in Ukraine, which Russia would likely try to leverage in Ukrainian–Russian talks to extract further concessions. Any future ceasefire will require Russia and Ukraine to engage in separate negotiations to agree on the necessary robust monitoring mechanisms, and conflating ceasefire talks with peace settlement talks will likely delay the implementation of a ceasefire.<br> Russia must show its willingness to make concessions of its own in any future bilateral negotiations, especially as the Kremlin appears to be setting conditions to expand its list of demands amid the peace talks.[12] Russian officials have called for Ukraine to cede all of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts - even the areas that Russian forces do not currently occupy - before Russia can agree to a ceasefire.[13] Territorial demands are typically the subject of war termination negotiations, not ceasefire talks. Russia has reportedly already started to increase its demands, with Western and Ukrainian sources reporting that the Russian delegation threatened to seize Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts - two oblasts that Russia has not illegally annexed or claimed - during the May 16 talks in Istanbul.[14] This tactic suggests that Russia will make additional, more extreme territorial demands during war termination talks should Ukraine agree to Russia&#39;s ceasefire preconditions.<br> Russia reportedly continues to expand its military infrastructure along its border with Finland and Estonia, likely in preparation for future aggression against NATO. The New York Times (NYT) reported on May 19 that recent satellite imagery, which NATO officials confirmed, shows that Russia is building bases and military infrastructure near the Finnish and Estonian borders.[15] The NYT reported that Russian forces are building and renovating tents, vehicle storage warehouses, fighter jet shelters, and helicopter bases at Olenya and Alakurtti air bases in Murmansk Oblast, Kamenka Air Base in Komi Republic, and Petrozavodsk Air Base in the Republic of Karelia. A senior NATO official stated that Russia will likely redeploy troops further north when its war in Ukraine ends and that Russia assesses that its access to the Arctic is key for its great power status. The NYT stated that Finnish defense officials predict that it will take Russia roughly five years to build up its forces to threatening levels after the war in Ukraine is over, possibly tripling the number of Russian forces on the Finnish border. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) similarly reported in April 2025 that Western military and intelligence officials stated that Russia is expanding military bases near Petrozavodsk and upgrading railway lines and other infrastructure along Russia&#39;s western border with NATO.[16] Russian Presidential Aide and former Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev recently used narratives similar to those that the Kremlin has used to justify its invasions of Ukraine to threaten Finland.[17]<br> Ukraine&#39;s Western allies continue to provide military aid to Ukraine. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on May 18 and confirmed the provision of Abrams tanks to Ukraine, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported on May 19 that the first of 49 Abrams tanks are en route to Ukraine.[18] Denmark announced on May 17 a military aid package for Ukraine worth 4.2 billion Danish kroner (about $632 million) for 2025–2028 that includes artillery systems and ammunition, equipment for fighter jets, and funding for Ukrainian Air Force training facilities.[19] The Finnish Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced on May 19 that it signed an agreement with the European Commission to supply Ukraine with materiel and heavy ammunition worth 90 million euros (about $101 million) using the profits from Russian frozen assets.[20]<br> Key Takeaways:<br> 1/ US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call on May 19 to discuss ceasefire and peace negotiations regarding Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine.<br> 2/ Russia must explicitly acknowledge the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and constitution and Ukraine&#39;s sovereignty in order to engage in meaningful, good-faith negotiations.<br> 3/ Russia must agree that ceasefire negotiations must precede peace settlement negotiations.<br> 4/ Russia must show its willingness to make concessions of its own in any future bilateral negotiations, especially as the Kremlin appears to be setting conditions to expand its list of demands amid the peace talks.<br> 5/ Russia reportedly continues to expand its military infrastructure along its border with Finland and Estonia, likely in preparation for future aggression against NATO.<br> 6/ Ukraine&#39;s Western allies continue to provide military aid to Ukraine.<br> 7/ Ukrainian forces recently advanced in Kursk Oblast and near Borova and Toretsk.

The written version is here (my favorite), the video is here, and the podcast is here.<br> Off we go …<br>  Market Action<br> Markets opened at the low of the day (down over 300 points) and steadily climbed higher throughout the day.<br> The Dow closed up +137 points (+0.32%), the S&amp;P 500 up nine basis points, and the Nasdaq dead flat.<br> *CNBC, DJIA, May 19, 2025<br> The media would have you believe the story of the day was the Moody’s downgrade of U.S. debt, but I am not convinced that is true. The Aa1 rating (one notch below AAA) was basically the same that Standard &amp; Poor’s and Fitch already had, and of course, there isn’t anything in the downgrade rationale that has not been brutally and painfully obvious to everyone with a pulse for over a decade. I am sure there is some symbolic significance in the downgrade for someone, somewhere, but no, it is not some revelatory announcement, whatsoever.<br> The ten-year bond yield closed today at 4.45%, up just one basis point on the day (after hitting 4.56% at one point). Moody’s can take comfort in the fact that markets responded to their warning for almost thirty minutes!<br> Top-performing sector for the day: Health Care (+0.96%)<br> Bottom-performing sector for the day: Energy (-1.55%)<br> Wal-Mart announced last week that they saw little choice but passing along the impact of tariffs to consumers. President Trump tweeted that they should not do that, and “he would be watching them.” Wal-Mart has an average margin of 2.9% on goods sold. The period between the two and the nine is not a typo.<br> Japan ships $40 billion of automobiles to the United States per year (1.5 million cars), 30% of its total exports!! You may have heard that Americans like their automobiles. The tariff Japan charges on U.S. auto imports is 0%, but you may have heard they don’t much care for our autos. How a deal gets worked out here, I am not sure. My sources tell me this deal was thought to be one of the easier ones, and is becoming one of the harder ones.<br>  Top News Stories<br> President Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin today and then, separately, with Zelenskyy of Ukraine. His follow-up “tweets” suggested that both parties are moving forward with talking about talking about a talk to enact a cease-fire, and ultimately an end to the hostilities. I don’t want to make light of what transpired – there was a not insignificant risk that the call would result in significant regress, and it appears to have not gone that way. But yes, there is a long way to go.<br> The Biden family announced last night that former President Biden has been diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer.<br>  Public Policy<br> Late Sunday night the conservative hardliners (I hate that term) did allow the House budget bill out of committee (they had blocked it as of Friday), but that is a far cry from getting the full House vote needed, and getting the Senate vote, and getting the Senate version to be one the House will accept after revisions.<br> There has not been a lot announced on what has been modified in the bill from Friday to get those who were holding it up in committee to agree, but the general understanding I have is that the “minor modifications” include a more imminent enforcement of work requirements for Medicaid and more aggressive removal of clean energy tax credits.<br> The latest draft includes a $40,000 SALT deduction cap (vs. the $30,000 proposed in last week’s bill), but with a $200,000 income limit that really is moot. Speaker Johnson is meeting with the SALT caucus at 9:00 pm tonight.<br> The next step is the Rules Panel hearing set for… wait for it… 1:00 am on Wednesday morning (with a floor vote on the House desired for Thursday)<br> My own view continues to be that the story here has changed, whereby the focus in the public is now on whether or not the politics will end up accruing to the President’s favor (that is, will he get the cosmetic win of a bill passing), and yet the focus of markets will be on the bill, itself. In other words, no matter how much dancing takes place between now and then, I think they are getting a bill – I just think it is proving to be a much less consequential one than previously believed.<br>  Economic Front<br> The Producer Price Index (PPI) declined by -0.5% in April, bringing the year-over-year PPI to just +2.4%. Energy and Food wholesale prices were down but the Core PPI was also down -4% in April. Goods prices are up +0.5% year-over-year, with Services up +3.3% year-over-year.<br> Freight shipments from China were up +275% this week versus the week prior in the aftermath of the Trump reversal on tariffs with China.<br> Retail sales rose +0.1% in April and are up +5.2% vs. a year ago.<br> Japan’s economy contracted 0.2% last quarter, more than expected, which is not helping Japan much in terms of leverage regarding the trade discussions with the Trump administration.<br>  Housing &amp; Mortgage<br> The NAHB Sentiment Index for May was abysmal, dropping six more points (to 34). This was the weakest it has been since late 2022 and reflects very poor Present Situation read and very weak Prospective Buyers Traffic. The tariff issues around lumber, steel, and aluminum have created huge issues for builders (78% saying it has created difficulties pricing homes).<br> Housing starts rose 1.6% in April to a 1.36 million annualized rate, below the consensus expectation, and down -1.7% from the low level of last year’s starts. Single-family starts are actually down -12% over the last year, as all net new housing starts are in the multi-family category.<br>  Federal Reserve<br> We are sitting at a 92% probability of no change in the Fed Funds rate at the June meeting now, so yes, those praying for a rate cut, 8% odds are “saying there’s a chance.”<br> What is a bigger change is that we are only at 35% implied probability of a rate cut in July, now, as the Presidential reversal on tariff threats reduced the odds of the economic distress the market was pricing in as a catalyst to a cut.<br> And along those lines, we are now sitting at a 23% chance of just one cut by the end of the year, a 38% chance of two cuts, a 26% chance of three cuts, and only 7% of four cuts (with some minimal odds around the edges to round out).<br>  Oil and Energy<br> WTI Crude closed at $62.10, up a tiny bit.<br> Midstream energy stocks were up +2.5% last week, refiner stocks (downstream) were up HUGE, and upstream was somewhere in the middle. Crude itself was up about +2.5%. All aspects of the energy story were taking in the China tariff suspension early in the week and improved economic outlook from there.<br> MLPs particularly shone last week (up around 4-5%) but had lagged the week prior.<br> Ask TBG<br>  “Thanks for writing this week about Warren Buffett. Your missive was not what I expected, but excellent in a very different way and insightful as always. My questions are: (1) Why have so many tried to emulate the portfolio management style of Buffett and Munger, but so few followed Berkshire’s actual business model? (2) Is there any credence to Berkshire using leverage from owning insurance and reinsurance balance sheet assets? And (3) They own dividend and growing dividend equities but do not pay a dividend… Help me understand?” @ Fred H.<br> I think the current effort of Ackman with Hughes is a good example of how some do see the general appeal of the Berkshire model. Getting permanent capital, a Holdco with that regulatory apparatus, and the permanent capital and recurring cash flows of that insurance model, is not exactly easy to replicate. I also suspect some have tried versions of the structure that we have never really seen because the execution failed before we would have been privy.<br> I think there is category confusion here. They certainly cannot (and have not) “borrowed” from the balance sheets of insurance companies to buy assets for the Berkshire balance sheet. But perhaps what you are referring to is the embedded recurring cash flows the insurance models provide that provide benefit (and permanent opportunity flow) to the hold co? But that is the essence of the model itself, and I think a misnomer to label it “leverage.”<br> It is functionally (for owners) a fund where dividends are set to “reinvest” … The hold co receives dividends – the dividends grow – but it is not a mutual fund, and their entire business model is based on finding other business opportunities. Their universe for investible opportunities is infinite and as #1 and #2 above refer to the model is based on reinvestment of recurring cash flows (one summary I heard years ago was they go short fear (i.e. receive insurance premiums), and use those premiums to go long America (i.e buying railroads and blue chips and industrials and energy and so forth and so on). But the dividend reality and dividend growth reality, while not inherently the same as my investment philosophy, is indeed embedded within many of the companies of the hold co – but why the hold co does not pay it out speaks to the entire essence of what the hold co is. I think people wondering about this view Berkshire Hathaway as a mutual fund or “active stock portfolio,” which is simply not accurate.<br>  On Deck<br> All eyes are on the tax bill, with the FOMC meeting behind us and earnings season behind us.<br> Reach out with any questions, as always!<br> With regards,<br> David L.

It allows officials to grant temporary legal immigration status to migrants from disaster- or war-stricken countries for up to 18 months at a time. Under the program, immigrants can get work permits and other documentation to live in the U.S. <br> During his first term, President Trump laid the groundwork for granting protections to Venezuelans by issuing an order that deferred deportations, citing instability under the government of Nicolás Maduro. The Biden administration formalized and extended those protections several times through October 2026.<br> Trump’s push to curtail incoming migration and increase deportations has met significant roadblocks in the courts, teeing up confrontations between the executive and judicial branches. <br> The Supreme Court has previously blocked the administration’s efforts to deport groups of Venezuelan migrants on minimal notice and without hearings, at least temporarily. The high court is also weighing the White House’s appeal of lower-court rulings that blocked a Trump mandate to end birthright citizenship. <br> “Temporary Protected Status is, by definition, temporary, and is committed to the discretion of the DHS secretary. District courts have no right to prevent the executive branch from enforcing our immigration laws,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Monday afternoon. <br> Stripping the protection would mean nearly 350,000 people would immediately lose the right to live and work in the U.S., according to the group of migrants that brought the challenge. The Trump administration has also moved to rescind temporary protected status from some migrants from Haiti and Afghanistan.<br> In a brief seeking the high court’s intervention, Solicitor General John Sauer said that Congress gave DHS broad authority to designate unsafe countries and to manage the TPS program.<br> Lawyers for the plaintiffs - the National TPS Alliance, an organization representing migrants in the U.S. protected under the program - argued that Noem didn’t have the authority to terminate the program early and was motivated by racism against Venezuelans.<br> The immediate rescission of the protections is unprecedented, according to Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, and counsel for plaintiffs.<br> “That the Supreme Court authorized it in a two-paragraph order with no reasoning is truly shocking. The humanitarian and economic impact of the Court’s decision will be felt immediately, and will reverberate for generations,” Arulanantham said.<br> Write to Mariah Timms at mariah.timms@wsj.com</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R35" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">36</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:7473px;left:-1px">ĐẢNG DÂN CHỦ LẠC LOÀI...

For years, the Connecticut Senator, who took office shortly after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, was one of the nation’s most outspoken advocates for tighter gun laws. Gun safety was so important, he argued, that supporting an assault-weapons ban should be mandatory for Democratic leaders. <br> Recently, Murphy has come to believe he was wrong. Not about tougher gun laws, but about trying to force all Democrats to adopt his position. “I bear some responsibility for where we are today,” he told me in a phone interview in April. “I spent a long time trying to make the issue of guns a litmus test for the Democratic Party. I think that all of the interest groups that ended up trying to apply a litmus test for their issue ended up making our coalition a lot smaller.”<br> Murphy’s shift in thinking is part of the reckoning that has gripped the party since President Donald Trump’s victory in November. Democrats could dismiss Trump’s first win as a fluke. His second, they know, was the product of catastrophic failure - a nationwide rejection of Democratic policies, Democratic messaging, and the Democrats themselves. The party got skunked in every battleground state and lost the popular vote for the first time in 20 years. They lost the House and the Senate. Their support sagged with almost every demographic cohort except Black women and college-educated voters. Only 35% of Democrats are optimistic about the future of the party, according to a May 14 AP poll, down from nearly 6 in 10 last July. Democrats have no mojo, no power, and no unifying leader to look to for a fresh start.<br> Lost: The Democrats Time Magazine cover<br> TIME photo illustration; Source Images (Donkey: Richard Bailey -Corbis/Getty Images; Paper: MirageC/Moment/Getty Images)<br> Everyone knows how bad things are. “As weak as I’ve ever seen it,” says Representative Jared Golden of Maine, who represents a district Trump won. Trump’s second term is “worse than everyone imagined,” says Nevada Senator Jacky Rosen. The Democratic National Committee has offered few answers as it prepares to release a “postelection review” sometime this summer. “I don’t like to call it an ‘autopsy’ because our party’s not dead - we’re still alive and kicking,” explains Ken Martin, the new party chair. “Maybe barely, but we are.”<br> You already know most of the reasons for the 2024 fiasco. Joe Biden was too old to be President, and just about everybody but Joe Biden knew it. His sheer oldness undermined all efforts to sell his policies effectively. Democrats lost touch with the working class, with men, with voters of color, with the young. Voters saw Democrats as henpecked by college-campus progressives, overly focused on “woke” issues like diversity and trans rights. They tried to convince people that the economy was good when it didn’t feel good; they tried to convince people that inflation and illegal immigration were imaginary problems. In an era when voters around the globe were in an anti-incumbent mood, Democrats were stuck defending the status quo. The pandemic election of 2020 and the post-Dobbs midterms in 2022 lulled top party officials into a dangerous complacency. They thought Americans hated Trump enough to accept an unsatisfying alternative. They thought wrong. <br> Over the past two months, I’ve spoken to dozens of prominent Democrats, from Senators to strategists, frontline House members to upstart progressives, and activists to top DNC officials, in an effort to figure out how the party can chart its way back. I asked them all versions of the same questions. How did they dig this hole, and how can they get out of it? What ideas do Democrats stand for, beyond opposing an unpopular President? How can they reconnect with the voters they’ve lost? Who should be leading them, and what should they be saying? In other words: What’s the plan? <br> Many of these conversations made my head hurt. Democrats kept presenting cliches as insights and old ideas as new ideas. Everybody said the same things; nobody seemed to be really saying anything at all. But in between feeble platitudes about “showing up and listening” and “fighting for the working class” and “meeting people where they are,” a few common threads emerged.<br> Chris Murphy<br> Murphy has reconsidered his approach to litmus tests and leaned in to economic populism Jose Luis Magana — AP<br> Democrats know they have a branding problem that transcends policy, messaging, or leadership questions. They largely agree they need to re-center economic issues in their messaging and develop what some are calling a “patriotic populism” to counter Trump. They need to build a bigger tent. Many moderate Democrats want to sideline the activist groups that pressured elected officials to take unpopular positions. Even many progressives are retreating from the purity politics that reigned in the Trump era. They know they need fresh ideas and new leaders, even though they can’t always agree on how to find them.<br> The intraparty squabbles between moderates and progressives that have dominated the past decade have given way to different fault lines. “If you’re talking about ‘conservative’ or ‘liberal,’ or ‘progressive’ or ‘moderate,’ you’re missing the whole f-cking point,” says Representative Pat Ryan, who outran Kamala Harris by double digits in his purple district in New York’s Hudson Valley. “It’s not progressive or moderate. It’s status quo or change. It’s for the people or for the elites.” <br> After a brutal winter, Democrats are beginning to show signs of life. The party won a crucial supreme court race in Wisconsin and picked up two seats in the Pennsylvania statehouse. In early April, roughly 4 million people attended more than 1,300 rallies across the U.S., demanding their leaders fight harder against Trump. The Fighting Oligarchy Tour, headlined by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has drawn hundreds of thousands of people across red states. The grassroots is sending a clear message to sitting Democrats: Do better, or we’ll replace you with people who will. <br> Most in the party recognize this is a crisis moment. But every crisis is also an opportunity - a chance to rethink policies, reframe messaging, and recruit new leaders who can meet the moment. The last time Democrats were this deep in the wilderness was in 2005, when few outside the DNC had heard of Barack Obama. Republicans’ own search for answers in the wake of Mitt Romney’s 2012 defeat gave rise to Trump. When you hit rock bottom, anything is possible - and every transformative political figure of the modern age has emerged from a moment like this one.<br> It’s a sunny Tuesday in early spring, and Jake Auchincloss is sitting on a bench outside the Rayburn House Office Building. Auchincloss, a 37-year old third-term Congressman from Massachusetts, seems nervous, almost jittery, as he explains why he thinks everybody is getting the Democrats’ problems wrong. “I hear a lot: ‘Get a leader, let’s rally behind somebody.’ And I strongly disagree with that,” Auchincloss told me. “The forest of ambition is large. There’s no shortage of presidential timber. I’m worried about the ideas.” This is what keeps Auchincloss up at night: “It’s that we are bereft of big ideas.”<br> Auchincloss has a few. He wants to offer free one-on-one tutoring to kids who are behind in school because of COVID-19, subsidize community-health clinics, and hold social media corporations accountable for what he calls the “attention fracking” of America’s youth. But a decade of fighting MAGA, he says, has “depleted some intellectual dynamism” from his party. “In 2028, we’d better be ready to have dynamic candidates on the stage offering whole new ideas,” he warns, “or we’ll lose again.”<br> In our conversations, Democrats often made that argument. It’s not enough to say what we’re against, they’d say, we have to say what we’re for. But when I asked these same party insiders what that should be, most regurgitated ideas Democrats have run on for decades. Protect Social Security and Medicare! Protect abortion rights! Protect labor! OK, I’d say. What about new ideas? They mentioned their own pet projects: a bill blocking a supermarket merger; a bill addressing specific veterans’ issues; a bill ensuring the right to fix your own car. Somehow, I had a hard time imagining “permitting reform!” as a rallying cry capable of mobilizing millions of low-information voters.<br> “I’ve heard some folks say, ‘It’s not our policies, we just have to communicate better,’” says Representative Angie Craig, who is running for an open Senate seat in Minnesota. “It actually is our policies that swing-state voters aren’t with us on. For those colleagues who were calling to defund the police: our voters are not with you on that.” <br> Most Democrats now acknowledge that the progressive movement encouraged a kind of purity politics that hampered the party’s ability to win majorities. “We swung the pendulum too far to the left,” says Representative Ritchie Torres, who represents a Bronx district where Trump made inroads with working-class people of color, as he did in cities around the country. “We have become more responsive to interest groups than to people on the ground.” <br> Many Democratic officials believe the party moved too far left on social issues in particular. “There are some sports where trans girls shouldn’t be playing against biological girls,” says one lawmaker, adding that most of his fellow Democrats agree but are “afraid of the blowback that comes from a very small community.” Even abortion is up for a rethink. Some Democrats want a retreat from the enthusiastic embrace of abortion rights, and a return to talking about abortion as “safe, legal, and rare,” as Bill Clinton put it. “Refusing to say that even in the third trimester there’s no limits on it, it’s not where the average American is,” says another Democratic lawmaker. “The really embarrassing truth is Donald Trump is closer to the median voting on abortion than Democrats were.” Yet the fact these lawmakers would only share these thoughts without their names attached shows how much Democrats still fear antagonizing their liberal base. <br> Others insisted that the problem is one of emphasis. When Democrats spent so much time talking about other things - Student debt! LGBTQ rights! Police reform! Climate change! - voters decided they’d taken their eye off the ball. “You’ve got to be principally seen worrying about jobs and people’s pay and health care - economic issues,” says Representative Chris Deluzio, who represents a working-class district in western Pennsylvania. “And I think folks see too many Democrats as not caring principally about the economy.” <br> This theory might make more sense if Harris had run a 2024 campaign that was all about trans kids, abortion, and gun safety. Harris didn’t run that campaign. She offered tax credits to boost small businesses, proposals to lower the cost of groceries and childcare, and the most comprehensive affordable-housing plan ever put forth by a presidential candidate. And she lost. “Kamala Harris was talking about it,” says Representative Greg Casar of Texas, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “But nobody was hearing it.”<br> Senator Ruben Gallego met me outside the Senate gym, still slightly damp. Gallego, who was raised by an immigrant single mother and served in the Marine Corps, was a rare bright spot for his party last year. He outperformed Harris by 8 points in Arizona, handily won Latino men, and was one of only two new Democrats to win Senate battleground races. As we walked through the Capitol, Gallego, 45, describes his very simple message: “I’m here to bring you more security: economic security, and your personal family security.” It meant talking constantly about the cost of living, and taking a more hard-line stance on immigration than most of his Democratic peers.<br> When we arrived at his hideaway - Gallego was so new to the Senate that he had forgotten his key - the freshman Senator told me he didn’t necessarily think other Democrats needed to adopt his security message. He just wants them to speak like normal people. The party’s problem is bigger than bad messaging, he believes. The problem is caution. “Democrats in general are always fearful of messing up,” he said. “The Democratic mindset has been to run very tight, not open campaigns.” <br> I knew what he was talking about. Aides on the Biden and Harris campaigns were so cautious they’d often go off the record just to provide canned talking points. That approach, Gallego says, is self-defeating in the age of social media, where crafting the perfect sound bite can mean missing the moment altogether. “I told my team during the campaign: This is a vibe election,” says Gallego. “If we can match the policy with creating this vibe, this culture, that’s gonna break through across all modes and mediums.” His point was that the art of messaging has changed. It’s less about developing the perfect slogan, and more about authenticity, simplicity, virality. The more consult-ified something sounds, the less memorable it is.<br> U.S. Congress<br> Gallego, at the Capitol on Jan. 9, is urging fellow Democrats to be less cautious and more authentic Francis Chung - POLITICO/AP<br> Like Gallego, many moderate Democrats have particular critiques of the party’s economic message. “I think Democrats have made this mistake of saying, ‘I’m here to help the little guy.’ Nobody wants to be called the little guy,” says Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, 36, who has won twice in a red district in Washington State. “The fatal mistake in politics is condescension.” She’s not the only Democrat who thinks the party erred by targeting their messaging to the most marginalized, rather than the vast, struggling middle class. Nearly 70% of voters in battleground districts think Democrats are “too focused on being politically correct,” according to brutal internal polling shared with top party leaders in March, while a majority think Democrats are not looking out for working people and are “more focused on helping other people than people like me.”<br> The focus on protecting the most vulnerable, in other words, has left many Americans feeling ignored. “I constantly get draft mailers in my office that say things like ‘Democrats are fighting so you could put food on the table.’ That is not aspirational,” says Mallory McMorrow, a Michigan state senator now running for U.S. Senate. To McMorrow, the Democratic message should be simple, universal, and optimistic: “Democrats fight for the American Dream,” she says. <br> Others believe the party has to emphasize a more populist pitch to counter Trump’s. “The Democratic Party needs to make as our central message that our goal is to break the unholy alliance between corporate greed and corrupt government,” Casar told me. “If somebody is more conservative than me on this social issue, or we may disagree on this foreign policy issue, at the end of the day people say: the Democratic Party puts me first and the billionaires last. And that’s what wins.”<br> One of the things that surprised me over the course of these conversations was the way a Sanders-style economic populism had gained traction with politicians not normally associated with the Sanders wing of the party. “Our economy is rigged because our government is rigged,” Chris Murphy told me. Democrats, he added, “have to wake up every morning thinking about how to unrig our government so that the corporations and the billionaires don’t always get what they want.” This was a man who stumped so hard for Hillary Clinton in 2016 that he was on a shortlist to be her VP. “I think it was a huge mistake for our party to view Bernie as some fringe threat to the party,” he says now. “Bernie’s message all along has been the crossover message, the message that appeals both to Democrats but also to a big element of Trump’s base.”<br> Five months ago, Kat Abughazaleh was an online journalist and researcher who made viral takedowns of far-right figures. But when she saw Democrats clapping politely during Trump’s second Inauguration, something snapped. “It was just so pathetic,” she told me, speaking on the phone from her home office in the Chicago suburbs. “I was like, ‘Well, maybe they’ll actually do something.’ And then they didn’t.”<br> Shortly afterwards, Abughazaleh, 26, announced a primary challenge to Representative Jan Schakowsky, an 80-year-old party stalwart who has served in Congress since the year Abughazaleh was born. Schakowsky wasn’t the worst member of Congress, Abughazaleh thought. They agreed on a lot of issues. But Abughazaleh thought Schakowsky wasn’t up to the moment. Her campaign announcement video asked a simple question: “What if we didn’t suck?” She raised more money in the campaign’s first week than Schakowsky did the entire first quarter. Within six weeks, Schakowsky announced she would not seek re-election. <br> Even if the Democrats generate new policy ideas and adopt a sharper pitch, they’ll still bump up against the core issue that tanked Biden, Harris, and much of the rest of the party last year: age. Many Democrats are finally realizing that too many of their leaders are too established, too out-of-touch, or simply too old to connect with voters.<br> TOPSHOT-US-POLITICS-DEMONSTRATION-GOVERNMENT<br> Trump opponents gather in Los Angeles on April 5 in one of more than 1,300 protests nationwide Etienne Laurent - AFP/Getty Images<br> Four House Democrats died in office over the past year. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has acknowledged that Republicans could not have passed a budget resolution in April had their narrow majority not been widened by the deaths of two members of his own caucus. Of the 30 House Democrats who are 75 or older, more than half told Axios they planned to run for re--election next year.<br> Many Democrats are not eager only for generational change. They want change at the top of the party as well. Some see Jeffries and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer as too deferential to established norms or too reluctant to use procedural powers to slow down Trump’s agenda. Both are underwater in public-opinion polls. Only 27% of Americans approve of congressional Democrats overall - the lowest number since CNN started asking in 2008. “I think the party is hyperfocused on message and forgetting about the messenger,” says Amanda Litman, the co-founder of Run for Something, which recruits new Democrats to run for office and supports them with training, mentorship, and campaign tools. “They’ve missed the way people consume information. You look for a person, not an institution.”A sclerotic party establishment has created a culture of waiting your turn. “All the people that are in formal leadership roles,” says Pat Ryan, “are ladder climbers, not leaders.”<br> At the DNC, Martin has locked horns with the party’s new vice chair, David Hogg, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland school shooting who rose to national prominence as a gun-safety activist. Hogg’s political organization, Leaders We Deserve, plans to invest $20 million to support young candidates challenging “asleep-at-the-wheel” Democrats in safe seats. Hogg tells me the party’s post-Biden “realignment” isn’t primarily about ideology. “It’s: Do you want to fight or do you want to roll over and die?” Martin has publicly rebuked Hogg, insisting the DNC maintain its long-standing position of neutrality. On May 12, the DNC’s credentials committee voted to void the elections of Hogg and another party official for procedural reasons they said predated the controversy, setting up the prospect of Hogg’s losing his position.<br> In the meantime, a new breed of Democrat is stepping up. They’re younger, more digitally fluent, more working class. They speak American without a D.C. accent. “People who haven’t been politicians for 30 years can go into a nonpolitical space and be a real person,” Amanda Litman told me as she walked to pick her children up from day care. These new candidates can talk persuasively about the costs of housing and childcare, issues that probably haven’t affected your life much if you’ve been in Congress since 1995. “It’s not the magic words,” says Litman. “It’s that many of these people can’t be credible messengers.”<br> Some new ones may emerge from the younger generation of Democrats who were elected in the 2018 wave after Trump’s first victory, and are now running statewide. Mallory McMorrow, 38, and Haley Stevens, 41, are vying for Michigan’s open Senate seat. Angie Craig, 53, is running for Senate in Minnesota. Abigail Spanberger, 45, is running for Governor of Virginia. Representative Mikie Sherrill, 53, is running for Governor of New Jersey. “The fight is generational,” Sherrill says. As soon as she arrived in Congress in 2019, she told me, she encountered an “entrenched” cohort of “collegial” lawmakers who -refused to update their strategic playbook because they kept waiting for politics to go back to the chummy inside game it had been pre-2016. “Do I think we need a new generation of leaders? Yes,” she told me. “But guess what: I think we’re about to get it.”<br> When Greg Casar arrived at the Tucson rally for Sanders’ and Ocasio-Cortez’s Fighting Oligarchy tour, the line of spectators stretched so long that Casar’s Uber driver thought he was going to a concert. Organizers had expected 2,000 people at a high school gymnasium; he said more than 10 times that many showed up. “People are even more opposed to what Donald Trump is doing than eight years ago,” Casar told me, fiddling with his AirPods as he sat outside a committee markup in late April. “But they want a new kind of leadership from the Democratic Party.”<br> As party leaders in Washington debate how to move forward, their grassroots base is sick of waiting for them to figure it out. Frustrated liberals have founded roughly 1,400 local Indivisible groups since the election, including more than 600 in GOP congressional districts. More than 46,000 young people have signed up to run for office through Run for Something since November. To those who participated in the “Resistance” movement of the first Trump term, the grassroots rage feels different this time. It’s not just targeted at Trump; it’s also focused on the feeble Democrats and spineless institutions who have failed to effectively resist him.<br> House Progressive Caucus Holds Capitol Hill Press Conference On Elon Musk&#39;s Government Interference<br> Casar, joined by fellow Progressive Caucus members, speaks on Elon Musk&#39;s government interference on Feb. 06 Kayla Bartkowski - Getty Images<br> Some Democratic officials have responded by copying Trump’s own playbook. They’re favoring nonpolitical podcasts over cable studios, burnishing their social-media game, showing up at football games and Coachella. They’re trying to worry less about who they’re offending and more about who they’re reaching. Group chats of -Democratic lawmakers are full of delicate negotiations on how best to respond to the Trump presidency. “We recognize that the most important thing we can do is make this guy unpopular,” says one lawmaker. They’re sharing talking points and legal strategies, while weighing various acts of defiance against the potential for distraction. Internal discussions, says this lawmaker, are laser-focused on “figuring out what’s tactically smarter.” <br> Most Democrats expect a public outcry against Trump’s policies will help them retake the House in 2026. Winning back the Senate will be tougher, with more Democrats on defense in battleground states. In the meantime, a shadow presidential primary is already taking shape, with hopefuls drawing different lessons from Trump’s win and its aftermath. California Governor Gavin Newsom has started a podcast, featuring Trump allies like Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk as guests, and pivoted to the center in his day job, cracking down on homeless encampments and pushing to reduce health care benefits for undocumented immigrants. Barnstorming against oligarchy helped Ocasio-Cortez raise $9.6 million in the first quarter of the year, rekindling speculation about her viability as a candidate for higher office. Cory Booker’s marathon Senate speech protesting Elon Musks’s cuts to the federal government was liked more than 350 million times on TikTok. And Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker railed against “do-nothing Democrats” in a speech in New Hampshire. As Pritzker put it: “The reckoning is finally here.” <br> Democrats are coming around to a new mantra: winning the argument is less important than winning elections. If the path to victory means embracing economic populism, they’ll do it. If they have to make room for new faces, then sayonara, old friends. If they need to tack to the center on some social issues, so be it. If winning requires doing more podcasts, or embracing Instagram influencers, or campaigning on permitting reform, they’ll give it a try. Because now that Democrats have seen what a second Trump presidency looks like, they’re relearning the lesson they should have known all along: only winning is winning.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R36" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">37</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3057px;left:-1px">HẠ VIỆN CỘNG HÒA TẠM QUA ẢI NGÂN SÁCH<br> Mãi tới đêm qua, Chủ Nhật, các dân biểu hữu trách trong Hạ Viện Cộng Hòa mới đạt thỏa thuận tạm về dự luật ngân sách theo tinh thần của Tổng thống Trump.

While Republicans, who have vowed to reduce red ink, say higher economic growth will fill the gap, budget analysts across the political spectrum have panned the Republican plan, warning that it worsens the U.S. fiscal picture.<br> The bill could reach the House floor this week, and it is a tenuous balance between the party’s tax-cut wing and factions seeking larger, quicker spending cuts. To get a bill through the House with their 220-213 majority, GOP tax cutters trimmed their ambitions and scheduled some breaks to expire. Many spending hawks, meanwhile, backed the plan while groaning that it doesn’t go far enough fast enough. Others are holding out for more.<br> The measure stalled in the Budget Committee on Friday. The panel revoted late Sunday and advanced the measure 17-16, with four conservatives - Chip Roy (R., Texas), Ralph Norman (R., S.C.), Josh Brecheen (R., Okla.) and Andrew Clyde (R., Ga.) - voting present after voting no on Friday, allowing the bill to proceed.<br> Party leaders spent the weekend negotiating with lawmakers pushing in several directions, and talks continued late Sunday.<br> Conservative hard-liners such as Roy want accelerated spending cuts and quicker expirations of clean-energy tax breaks. He said on X after Sunday night’s vote that Medicaid work requirements will be accelerated but the measure doesn’t do enough to change the health program’s funding structure or cut off the energy tax credits. “We can and must do better before we pass the final product,” he said.<br> But lawmakers such as Rep. Jen Kiggans (R., Va.) are concerned that clean-energy breaks vanish too quickly. Rep. Nick LaLota (R., N.Y.), sought a higher top marginal income-tax rate to help pay for a larger state and local tax deduction.<br> FY2025&#39;30123$4 trillionCurrent deficit​projections<br> Deficit projections after​House GOP bill<br> Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) predicted on Fox News on Sunday morning that the package would pass the House ahead of leaders’ Memorial Day deadline.

Publicly held federal debt stands at about $29 trillion, nearly double the level when Trump and Republicans passed the 2017 tax law. Nearly $1 in every $7 the U.S. spends goes toward paying interest, more than the country spends on defense.<br> “While Republicans were campaigning on reducing spending and controlling the growth in the debt, once they put pen to paper, their real priorities demonstrate that they care a lot more about cutting taxes,” said Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy at the libertarian Cato Institute. <br> Longer-dated Treasury bond yields topped 5% on Monday morning, lifted by unease about U.S. government borrowing.<br> Republicans hear those concerns - and see the bill as a positive fiscal step. It prevents a 2026 tax increase they view as unacceptable and alters social-safety-net programs in ways that the last all-Republican government couldn’t achieve eight years ago. <br> White House budget director Russell Vought described the spending cuts as historic. <br> “It should not be lost on anyone, the degree to which it ends decades of fiscal futility and gets us winning again,” Vought wrote on X in a plea for fiscal hawks’ votes. <br> Rep. Jay Obernolte (R., Calif.), a Budget Committee member, said the Republican plan would unquestionably put the country on a stronger fiscal footing. <br> “If you have to pick between a higher-tax, higher-spending regime and a lower-tax, lower-spending regime, the latter is always better for economic growth,” he said. <br> Rep. Chip Roy at a House Budget Committee markup meeting.<br> Conservative hard-liners such as Rep. Chip Roy of Texas are seeking accelerated spending cuts.

Rural hospitals face closures,” said Rep. Becca Balint (D., Vt.). “And yet the very rich will get even richer at the expense of our children and grandchildren, who will shoulder the burden of that additional debt.”<br> In designing a partisan plan that increases budget deficits, Republicans are mindful about what happens if their bill falls apart. The alternate path to preventing a tax increase on most households would require a bipartisan coalition with Democratic votes. <br> Advertisement<br> That could further increase deficits. Democrats favor extending most tax cuts but would push to let tax cuts expire for top earners. They would, however, reject Republican spending cuts and seek extensions of expanded tax credits for purchasing health insurance. <br> Taxes and spending out of sync<br> Here’s the basic picture: The U.S. has a structural imbalance between taxes and spending, due to its aging population, spending increases, rounds of tax cuts and emergency programs during the 2008 financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. <br> Higher public debt can push up bond yields and interest rates and crowd out private investment. Bond yields are already much higher than in 2017 when Republicans passed their original tax-cut bill, pressuring lawmakers to be mindful of deficits. <br> If Congress does nothing, the country will borrow another $21 trillion from 2025 through 2034. That would increase publicly held debt as a share of gross domestic product to 117% from about 100%, topping the post-World War II high, according to the Congressional Budget Office. <br> Compared with that scenario, the Republican bill widens deficits by about 13%, reducing spending but lowering revenue by more. <br> The bill would cut taxes by nearly $4 trillion, compared with doing nothing. That includes extensions of expiring tax cuts and new temporary cuts to fulfill Trump’s campaign promises. It is partially offset by tax increases, including limits on top earners’ itemized deductions and clean-energy tax breaks. <br> Mike Johnson, Republican House Speaker from Louisiana, at the US Capitol.<br> House Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol on Thursday as Republicans worked on the legislation. Photo: Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg News<br> The GOP plan generates about $1.6 trillion in spending reductions and other deficit-reducing policies. Those include work requirements for Medicaid recipients, restrictions on nutrition assistance and student-loan changes. The bill includes several hundred-billion dollars in spending increases on border security, national defense and support for farmers. <br> Final official estimates aren’t available, but the total deficit effect is roughly $2.7 trillion compared with doing nothing and letting tax cuts expire, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The bill may change as Republicans maneuver it to Trump’s desk by July 4. <br> “On the horizon that investors care about, which is the first four years, it makes it worse,” said analyst Don Schneider of Piper Sandler. Still, he said, many spending cuts, including Medicaid changes, are real, indicating that Republicans are capable of restraining a major entitlement program. <br> Counting on growth<br> Republicans often argue that deficits won’t actually climb if the bill passes. They are counting on the bill’s tax cuts and Trump’s agenda of deregulation and oil-and-gas production to accelerate economic growth so much that extra tax revenue covers the costs. <br> Those claims, however, usually don’t include any drag from Trump’s tariffs, and economists say they are too optimistic about policies revving up the U.S. growth rate. <br> “Relying on economic growth has become the magic wand that Republicans are waving at any possible problem,” the Cato Institute’s Boccia said. <br> SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS<br> How concerned are you about the federal deficit? Join the conversation below.<br> Some Republicans say it is more realistic to assume expiring tax cuts get extended, then measure the bill after that $3.8 trillion adjustment. Viewed that way, the bill would reduce deficits.<br> However, the $2.7 trillion deficit increase likely underestimates potential budgetary effects. The legislation schedules popular tax cuts to expire after 2028, including extra boosts to the standard deduction and child tax credit and versions of Trump’s plans to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. <br> There will be political pressure to extend them and business tax breaks, just like today’s push for continuing expiring 2017 tax cuts. That would add $1.8 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. <br> “They assume the entire Trump agenda expires at that point, and that seems unlikely to me,” said Marc Goldwein, the group’s senior vice president. “The costs are front-loaded. That is the main driver.”<br> Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com<br> Copyright ©2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Là nghị sĩ cầm đầu đảng Dân Chủ tại Thượng viện, Schumer bất chấp sự thật, vẫn giữ thói đổ vấy cho đảng Cộng hòa hay Tổng thống Donald Trump về mọi sự và tưởng là cử tri sẽ tin. Chỉ còn 35% dân chúng tin vào tương lai của đảng Dân Chủ mà Schumer lại tái diễn sai lầm cũ, nhất là về chuyện cứ xảy ra tại thành phố New York của ông….<br> Dân Mỹ có một thành ngữ về trò gian đến trắng trợn là muốn bán một cây cầu cho người ta. Lần này, Nghị sĩ Schumer không lỡ một dịp may để nói nhảm, nên giáo sư Turley chỉ thẳng vào nơi chính hợp nhất: cây cầu Brooklyn của thành phố New York. <br> Tai nạn xảy ra khi một giang thuyền Mexico đụng vào thành cầu Brooklyn khiến hai người thiệt mạng, Nghị sĩ Schumer lập tức ra thông cáo đổ lỗi cho Chính quyền Trump. <br> Tức là Nghị sĩ trưởng khối Dân Chủ tại Thượng Viện lại rao bán cái cầu!<br> https://jonathanturley.org/.../and-i-have-a-bridge-in.../<br> And I Have a Bridge in Brooklyn to Sell You: Schumer Suggests that the Administration Caused the Mexican Ship Collision<br> (Jonathan Turley - Bizarre, Politics - May 19, 2025) <br> It has long been a practice for New York sharpies to scam chumps by offering to sell them the Brooklyn Bridge. However, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) tied an even harder scam in selling the idea on Sunday that the collision of the Mexican training ship Cuauhtémoc and the Brooklyn Bridge was the fault of the Trump Administration. Schumer appears to have missed the boat, literally, given the immediate reports of a loss of navigation ability on the vessel. In any case, the suggestion that cuts in staffing led to the crash is just the latest Democratic spin that dispenses with any factual foundation.<br> Democratic members have been actively spreading unfounded claims from the start of the Administration that tragedies were caused by reductions in staff or programs. That included blaming the Administration for a crash that occurred less than 24 hours after the new FAA commissioner took office as well as a crash in Canada due to bad weather. It simply does not matter if the claims are factually absurd. Democrats are rarely accused of disinformation and rely on a generally enabling legacy media.<br> The same pattern emerged after the blackout at Newark in a system that was flagged as antiquated during the Biden Administration and should have been replaced years ago. Despite only being in office for just over 100 days, the Democrats blamed the Trump Administration for the system failure.<br> Schumer pushed some of those earlier false claims. However, his gambit with the Brooklyn Bridge would embarrass the most hardened Brooklyn Bridge-selling grifter.<br> Unwilling to let any tragedy go to waste, the Democratic minority leader issued a press release declaring<br>  “We know there has been meddling by the Trump administration into USCG staffing, and we need to know how this might have impacted the events of last night - from a command, communication and local coordination level. There are indications that this service [Vehicle Traffic System] may not be fully or adequately functional in light of a hiring freeze. If this were the case, the Brooklyn Bridge accident would be a national harbinger, demanding immediate attention.”<br> However, there is no such connection or allegation in the accident that killed two sailors and injured 17 others.<br> The Coast Guard was obviously not amused. It issued its own press release Sunday that said that it immediately responded to the scene of the deadly collision:<br>  “Sector New York immediately launched a crew from Coast Guard Station New York to the scene and established a safety zone from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Manhattan Bridge. New York Vessel Traffic Services suspended commercial traffic in the area.”<br> President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency eliminated its Logistics Information Management System, which managed configuration, maintenance, supply chain and technical data. It was viewed as ineffective and the cut saved over $32 million. It had nothing to do with the accident.<br> The hair-trigger attacks after these tragedies only deepen the public’s distrust. Polling shows that the public’s confidence in Democrats in Congress is at a record low of 25%.<br> On the day of Schumer’s comment, a new poll from the Associated Press (AP) and NORC at the University of Chicago found that only 35 percent of Democrats are optimistic about the party’s future.<br> That makes sense when your Senate minority leader is trying to sell the public a bridge story that treats them like moronic marks who will buy anything.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R38" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">39</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">5/19/25</td><td class="s3 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:4512px;left:-1px">KHI THẨM PHÁN TỐI CAO PHÁP VIỆN LÀ CÁN BỘ SÁCH ĐỘNG…<br> Khi giới luật sư nêu vấn đề là khẩu khí đã sai, chúng ta có thêm một trường hợp, do Giáo sư Jonathan Turley trình bày với quý vị mà khỏi qua phiên âm hoặc sự sấu xa trong Thánh Kinh:... <br> https://jonathanturley.org/.../courting-controversy.../...<br> Courting Controversy: Justices’ Side Commentaries Undermine the Supreme Court<br> (Jonathan Turley - Columns, Constitutional Law, Courts - May 19, 2025)<br> Below is my column in The Hill on the controversy this month over extrajudicial comments made by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. These are only the latest such comments by justices that became distractions during the discussion of pending cases before the Court.<br> Here is the column:<br> This month, the crowd at the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture was electrified as a speaker called on the lawyers in the audience to “fight this fight” and declared, “We can’t lose the battles we are facing.”<br> What was particularly thrilling was that the declaration of “act of solidarity” was not coming from a Democratic member of Congress or an MSNBC host, but from Associate Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.<br> There was a day when such a speech would have been scandalous for a sitting justice of the Supreme Court. For much of the court’s history, justices avoided public speaking beyond the perfunctory commencement speech or circuit judicial conference. The tradition was that justices would limit comments on major issues to their written opinions, so as to avoid any question of partisanship or bias against litigants. It was considered a cost of being one of nine.<br> That tradition, however, was shattered in the 20th century by what I once called the “rise of the celebrity justice.” Despite my respect for them, I was critical of the late Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who seemed to relish appearances before ideologically supportive groups, discussing not only issues that might come before the court, but also making comments in books and speeches on political issues.<br> The troubling trend has created the impression of justices maintaining constituencies on the left and the right. The adoration and attention can have a corrosive effect on a jurist caught up in the moment. Previously, Sotomayor was criticized when she directly called for political action from young law students to defend abortion rights.<br> Sotomayor acknowledged, “I am pointing out to that when I shouldn’t because they tell me I shouldn’t.” However, she criticized a recent decision of the court from which she had dissented and chastised her conservative colleagues who “have opted to bury their heads in the sand.” She added, “You know, I can’t change Texas’ law but you can and everyone else who may or may not like it can go out there and be lobbying forces in changing laws that you don’t like.”<br> Sotomayor’s latest comments came shortly before the hearing in the birthright citizenship case, where the court has been asked to rein in district courts imposing national or universal injunctions against the Trump administration. Sotomayor’s sharp questioning of the solicitor general drew a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, who asked if the other justices could be allowed to hear the counsel’s answers.<br> The hearing also highlighted the public comments of another justice on the very matter before the Court. In 2022, when President Biden faced a fraction of the injunctions imposed against Trump, Justice Elena Kagan publicly condemned the use of universal injunctions in an interview at Northwestern University School of Law. She lashed out at the obvious “forum shopping” to get before favorable courts and said “It just cannot be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years it takes to go through the normal [appellate] process.” She added, “You look at something like that and you think, that can’t be right.”<br> Now, in the Trump administration, Kagan has a case that can right that wrong by requiring parties to certify a national class action if they want a national injunction. However, Kagan raised some eyebrows by quickly stating that “this case is very different” and then suggesting that there was a need for national injunctions against Trump.<br> As Solicitor General John Sauer tried to distinguish between the procedural question before the Court from the merits (which have not been fully briefed), Kagan and Sotomayor insisted that the unconstitutionality was clear. Kagan snapped “Every court is ruling against you.”<br> Kagan’s rationale was as disturbing as her apparent reversal. The merits of the birthright citizenship order are still being briefed in lower courts. Moreover, district courts have reasonably concluded that they are bound by prior Supreme Court decisions. The administration believes that those cases are wrong or wrongly interpreted. Most of us expected the Administration to lose in the lower courts before the issue can be raised with the Supreme Court.<br> And frankly, it will likely lose on the merits there as well. However, that was not the issue before the justices this week. The issue was whether, as a constitutional matter, district courts can bind an entire nation in resolving a case or must confine relief to the parties before it.<br> The Trump administration is not arguing that courts can never issue universal injunctions. Rather, it is arguing that one must establish a national class action in order to demand a national injunction from a district court. The process under Rule 23 of the federal rules includes tests for determining whether parties in a given case truly represent the interests of other similarly situated individuals.<br> Kagan and her liberal colleagues insisted that, even though they were not looking at the merits of the birthright citizenship case, they could take a “peek” at what Trump was trying to do. Kagan suggested that Trump’s birthright citizenship order was clearly unconstitutional and thus may warrant a national injunction even if other controversies might not.<br> Some of us believe that a court’s authority to issue injunctions should not change based on justices taking a peek ahead at the ultimate merits in a case. Kagan’s comments raised questions of whether an injunction “can’t be right” if a greater percentage of courts disagreed on the merits.<br> Putting aside how the Supreme Court will rule in the case (which is unclear), the controversy leading into the argument over Kagan’s earlier comments shows the perils of such public speeches. Kagan raised interesting concerns over ending such injunctions, but those points became enmeshed with her prior public positions. Her effort to distinguish the case led to claims that she was spinning a case to conform with her public commentary.<br> Sotomayor and Kagan have made many speeches that have uplifting messages for law students and lawyers alike, including some of the comments in these events. They are both worthy role models for all lawyers. However, these public comments are not a model for jurists, in my view. The controversies this week are only the latest examples of the costs to the court itself in justices holding forth on political subjects or issues that may come before them.<br> During the week of these controversies, another figure, retired Justice David Souter, passed away. One of the things I most respected in Souter was not only his modesty and civility but his reticence in making public comments. He spoke through his opinions and left the rest for others to debate.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R39" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">40</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3157px;left:-1px">AXIOS và BÀI ĐẦU TUẦN KÉM VUI VỀ KINH TẾ<br>Tổng hợp rất chuyên nghiệp của Mike Allen trên Bloomberg:<br>Sau khi đọc, xin chia sẻ nội dung với các bạn thật. <br>Cám ơn T.<br>https://fee.org/articles/falling-for-socialism/... <br>All Commentary - Saturday, May 17, 2025 - Institute for Economic Affairs Zoning Laws - Falling for Socialism<br>___ <br>Gen Z’s rage should be against cronyism, not capitalism. Across college campuses, on TikTok feeds, and in everyday conversations, a familiar narrative is gaining steam: capitalism is broken.<br>Rising rents and stagnant wages fuel the claim among some young people that free markets have failed an entire generation. According to a 2024 poll by the Institute of Economic Affairs, more than 60% of young Britons now view socialism favorably. In the United States, the trend is similar, with Generation Z increasingly skeptical of capitalism’s promises.<br>But much of this idealism is rooted in distance - many of the young people romanticizing socialism have never lived through the economic dysfunction or political repression it often brings. For those who experienced Soviet shortages, Venezuelan collapse, or East Germany’s surveillance, the word socialism doesn’t suggest fairness or opportunity - it suggests fear, failure, and control. There’s a reason so many fled those systems to come to freer countries. What sounds utopian in theory has too often turned dystopian in practice.<br>But blaming capitalism misses the mark. The real culprit is cronyism, the unholy alliance between big government and big business that twists markets, blocks competition, and rewards political connections over genuine innovation.<br>The Myth of Market Failure<br>Capitalism, in its true form, is based on voluntary exchange. It rewards businesses that meet people’s needs and wants, with consumers deciding what succeeds and what fails. Competition drives improvement, innovation, and lower prices. No one is forced to buy or sell anything; choice reigns.<br>Cronyism is a different beast altogether. In a crony system, businesses succeed not by serving customers but by lobbying politicians. Profits come through subsidies, bailouts, and regulations designed to crush competition.<br>The 2008 financial crisis, often cited as proof of capitalism’s failures, actually showcased what happens when markets are rigged. Reckless banks, instead of collapsing as they deserved, were bailed out with taxpayer money. Ordinary people lost jobs and homes, while the politically connected survived and thrived.<br>This wasn’t free enterprise. It was cronyism.<br>The COVID-19 pandemic provided a grim sequel. Small businesses were forced to shut their doors under government mandates. Meanwhile, corporate giants like Amazon, able to operate under looser restrictions or pivot online, soared to record profits. Policies, written in the name of public health, often privileged the biggest players while leaving Main Street devastated.<br>Cronyism on Both Sides of the Atlantic<br>Cronyism is not limited to one country or one political party. Across the United States and Europe, the symptoms are the same.<br>In the US, Canada, and the UK, the dream of homeownership slips further away for young people. Sky-high housing prices are blamed on “market failure,” but the real cause lies in layers of government-imposed barriers: restrictive zoning laws, burdensome permitting requirements, and endless bureaucratic delays. Big developers who can afford to navigate or influence the system survive. Everyone else gets locked out.<br>In Europe, the pattern repeats. France’s labor laws, designed to protect workers, instead stifle opportunity. Hiring becomes risky and expensive, especially for young people. Large corporations, with the resources to manage compliance costs, consolidate their dominance. Small firms and startups never get off the ground.<br>There’s also a persistent myth that big business fears government intervention. In reality, the largest corporations often embrace it, because it keeps them on top. Tech giants like Facebook and Google now lobby for more regulation, knowing that complex new rules will strangle smaller competitors who can’t afford fleets of compliance officers. Green energy subsidies, meant to combat climate change, often end up showering billions on well-connected firms while locking out emerging innovators.<br>Cronyism doesn’t reward the best ideas. It rewards the best lobbyists.<br>Why Gen Z’s Frustration Is Justified<br>Gen Z values fairness, creativity, and freedom. The very principles cronyism undermines. When political influence matters more than merit, and when success depends on government favoritism instead of consumer satisfaction, opportunity shrinks and innovation slows. But they are wrong when they think “socialism” would be a better option, not least because of the rampant cronyism that has existed in every socialist state.<br>The temptation to seek salvation through government power is not new. The Soviet Union began with a promise of equality and delivered oppression and scarcity (except for the party elites). Venezuela promised 21st-century socialism and delivered hunger, economic collapse, and political repression. Meanwhile, countries that embraced market freedom—even imperfectly—created unparalleled prosperity. Free markets have lifted billions out of poverty, and unleashed innovation that reshaped the modern world.<br>Markets aren’t flawless. But they leave the door open for anyone to succeed, not just those born into privilege or connected to power.<br>Aim Your Anger at the Right Target<br>Gen Z’s frustration is real, and it deserves an outlet. But the answer is not to tear down capitalism; it’s to tear down cronyism. A freer, fairer future depends on separating business from political power, not binding them closer together. It means ending corporate welfare, simplifying the rules of the game, and making sure that competition, not connections, decides who wins.<br>The fight for fairness is worth waging. But it must be aimed in the right direction. If we rage against cronyism, not capitalism, we can build a future where innovation thrives, opportunity is real, and every member of Generation Z has a genuine chance to rise.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R40" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">41</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3857px;left:-1px">AXIOS và BÀI ĐẦU TUẦN KÉM VUI VỀ KINH TẾ<br>Tổng hợp rất chuyên nghiệp của Mike Allen trên Bloomberg:<br>https://www.axios.com/.../axios-am-704c7670-342c-11f0...<br>(Axios AM - By Mike Allen - May 19, 2025) <br>Good Monday morning.

Go deeper.<br>***<br>1 big thing: Trump&#39;s tariff reality<br>Illustration: Lazaro Gamio/Axios<br>The Trump administration conceded this weekend what economists, CEOs and consumers long knew: Americans pay for tariffs, Axios managing editor for business Ben Berkowitz writes.Why it matters: Nearly a decade of Trump trade arguments held that foreign countries, not Americans, paid the ultimate cost of a trade war. But the president and his economic team now acknowledge that tariffs are raising prices for everyone, from industrial ports to retail storefronts.<br>🖼️ The big picture: Trump&#39;s sweeping global tariffs, effectively the highest in nearly a century, are expected to cost the average household more than $2,300 a year, according to the Yale Budget Lab.Even companies that once promised to hold the line on those costs, including Walmart, now say they have no choice but to pass them along.Inflation may be benign for now. But experts are increasingly convinced that higher prices are only a matter of time.<br>🛒 After Walmart said this week it would raise prices, a furious Trump insisted on Truth Social on Saturday that the company &quot;eat the tariffs&quot; - a concession that someone this side of the border had to pay something, somehow.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent then went on Sunday shows yesterday and said that while Walmart would eat some of the tariffs, consumers would have to pay, too.The intrigue: It was only May 11 that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted people had to drop the &quot;silly arguments&quot; that consumers would pay the costs of trade levies.Four days later, the country&#39;s largest retailer said that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;d have to do.<br>🛣️  Between the lines: Bessent said yesterday that while consumer prices may rise due to tariffs, people will see even bigger benefits from the falling price of gasoline.He argued it was effectively a tax cut for consumers, and would help keep inflation in line.<br>🥊 Reality check: With the average American vehicle using a little under 500 gallons of gas a year, and gas prices per gallon being a little over 40¢ cheaper today than a year ago, the average driver is looking at an annual savings of around $200 per car. That&#39;s a fraction of what budget experts estimate tariffs will cost households.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R41" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">42</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3557px;left:-1px">KHÔNG CHỈ BIDEN – CẢ TÒA BẠCH CUNG BỊ UNG THƯ!<br>Mà là ung thư tử cung nằm ở trên đầu, nên chúng khép đùi đẻ ra toàn chuyện láo nhưng được báo chí gia nô ca tụng là sáng suốt.

(Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP)<br>For 2023 and most of 2024, an elaborate play was staged for the American people. The production was brought to you by the Biden White House - and some of the most powerful men and women in the country.<br>(By Oliver Wiseman - The Free Press - 05.18.25 - U.S. Politics)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>It was as bad as you feared.<br>Joe Biden couldn’t remember the name of Jake Sullivan, his top national security aide. He stared at people he had known for decades, including George Clooney, like he’d never seen them before. His top advisers hid him from his own staff. Cabinet members realized that the president could not be relied upon to respond to an emergency that came at an inconvenient hour.<br>Original Sin, the new book by CNN host Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson, is all Washington can talk about right now. Although its official release isn’t until Tuesday, there have been enough previews and excerpts for everyone to know what it says: that the decision by Biden’s top aides to keep his cognitive decline a secret was an enormous scandal. Perhaps even the biggest political scandal of the 21st century.<br>The book provides jaw-dropping details about our slack-jawed former president and the people who tried - and failed - to deliver for him another four years in office, even though he was obviously incapable of doing the job. Yet these are bombshell revelations of a strange sort. They are vivid and enraging, but fundamentally unsurprising.<br>That’s because they confirm what most normal Americans - and indeed everyone who has ever known an elderly person - instinctively understood was happening behind closed doors. They could see with their own eyes that the president was losing his mental faculties.<br>Anyone who still doubts that should listen to the audio from Biden’s October 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, which Axios published on Friday. It makes Hur’s assessment of Biden as “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” seem generous.<br>Taken together, the book and the audio are a reminder that for 2023 and most of 2024, an elaborate play was staged for the American people. The production was brought to you by some of the most powerful people in the country. The First Lady and senior White House aides wrote the script.<br>Cabinet members and governors and senators and the legacy press all dutifully played their parts. Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg made it as slick a show as possible. Steven Spielberg helped with the lighting.<br>The conceit at the heart of it all: that Joe Biden was “sharp as a tack,” not only fit to serve as president at that moment, but the best choice to lead the country for another four years, until January 2029, when he would be 86.<br>It was an audacious, disgraceful stunt. Yet it was the strangest of “cover-ups,” given that Biden’s decline was a publicly observable reality - despite how determined the press seemed to discredit the idea.<br>But Americans could not be fooled.<br>Less than a year into his presidency, in November 2021, just 46 percent of voters said they thought he was mentally fit for the job. By September 2023, about three-quarters of Americans - including a majority of Democrats - had major concerns about his age and its impact on his ability to serve as president. That was before Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips announced a primary challenge on the grounds that Biden was too old, in the fall of 2023. It was before Hur published his damning report in February 2024. And before the June debate appearance that ended his candidacy.<br>The Biden story is less Watergate and more “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” The president’s courtiers indulged the fiction; the townspeople weren’t buying it. Why did the people with White House passes insist on, and in some cases genuinely believe, something that the rest of us could see was a fiction?<br>Because the Bidens have endured crisis after crisis - whether that’s Beau’s terminal brain cancer, which they were less than honest about at the time, or Hunter’s addiction - by building a narrative and living within it.<br>That’s where the press should come in, including, it must be noted, CNN and Jake Tapper himself. Tapper has wisely fessed up, saying that he looks back on his reporting of Biden’s health with “humility,” admitting that his coverage of the issue was “not enough.” It’s not just that the most powerful media companies and characters ignored it. Some went to great lengths to dismiss and deride criticisms of Biden. They even coined the term “cheap fakes” to discredit edited clips of Biden looking old and out of it. Even though he was, in fact, both of those things.<br>“The original sin of Election 2024 was Biden’s decision to run for re-election,” write Tapper and Thompson, but reading their book one is left angry not at Biden but at self-serving aides, cowardly Democratic elites, and - especially - a media who conveniently forgot their role in the democratic process.<br>What Original Sin, the Hur audio, and the Democrats answering questions about Biden’s mental decline in recent weeks all make clear is that we’ve barely scratched the surface of this scandal - perhaps the biggest political scandal of the 21st century so far.<br>The outstanding questions fall into two buckets: medical and constitutional. The most important in the first category: Was there any kind of diagnosis? In late February 2024, The New York Times published a story saying that Biden’s doctor described him as “fit for duty” after a physical and neurological exam. The Hur report had been issued three weeks earlier, yet the fact that the White House “declined to give specifics about the tests Mr. Biden had undergone” raised no questions for the Times.<br>Earlier, Josh Marshall, the editor in chief of Talking Points Memo, described Hur as having “totally slimed Biden” with his report. Most of the press agreed. As for Tapper, in October 2020, he accused Lara Trump of “mocking his stutter” when she suggested Biden was suffering from cognitive decline. When she continued to press her point, he cut off the interview. (Tapper’s co-author, Axios’s Alex Thompson, was one of the few mainstream reporters who wrote about Biden’s mental acuity before the infamous June debate.)<br>Shortly after the debate, one emeritus professor of neurology told The Free Press he believed Biden “had Parkinsonism.” Tapper and Thompson quote neurologists saying something similar. Had the president just lost a step, as his doctor claimed in 2024, or did he have a more serious problem that was not being disclosed? We deserve an answer to that question. We still do not have one.<br>The most pressing question in the second bucket: Who was running the country?<br>Administration staffers referred to Biden’s close-knit team of top advisers as The Politburo. It’d be a funny joke were it not so accurate a description of how America was being governed. Here’s how one insider described how decisions were made in the Biden administration: “Five people were running the country, and Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board.” One top official said: “I’ve never seen a situation like this before, with so few people having so much power.”<br>Meanwhile, cabinet meetings were literally scripted, one cabinet member told Tapper and Thompson.<br>Was the president the decision-maker? Yes, said another. “but if the inner circle is shaping them in such a way, is it really a decision? Are they leading him to something?”<br>“For months we didn’t have access to him,” complained another cabinet secretary. “There was clearly a deliberate strategy by the White House to have him meet with as few people as necessary.”<br>These accounts suggest the possibility that the Biden scandal was nothing less than a subversion of American democracy. It deserves much more thorough investigation and scrutiny than it has so far received.<br>Most of the Democratic establishment sources who provided the material for Original Sin - and Tapper and Thompson have clearly spoken to a lot of very powerful Democrats - show little sign of grasping any of this. Instead they offer self-exculpatory variations of: This is crazy, I thought to myself as I left the fundraiser. And when they lament their party’s mistake, they are overwhelmingly focused on the fact that Biden’s decision to hide his cognitive decline cost them the White House; though he finally ceded to Kamala Harris, she could never recover from America’s anger at the deception.<br>But very few of the Democrats Tapper and Thompson interviewed seem to care whether Biden could do it for another term, and what it meant to be publicly supporting someone so ill-equipped for the role. For far too many, the biggest problem with the Weekend at Bernie’s ruse was simply that they hadn’t gotten away with it.<br>The specter of Donald Trump explains so much of this bad behavior. Time and again, Trump was invoked as the justification for quashing dissent, rewriting the primary rules, or silencing inconvenient voices.<br>The Democrats were frozen in panic at the prospect of a second Trump term. They couldn’t do what any sane party would do and move on from Biden when there was still time to do so properly. And that inaction led to exactly the outcome they so feared.<br>And yet Biden’s top aides had a strange cognitive dissonance with regard to Trump. One minute they insist that Biden alone is capable of defeating him. Thompson and Tapper report that after former Obama campaign chief and CNN talking head David Axelrod went public with his worries about Biden’s age, he got an angry call from Biden’s then chief of staff, Ron Klain, who asked: “Who else is going to do this, Axe?... Who’s going to beat Trump? President Biden is the only one who has done it.’ ”<br>The argument flipped a year later, when top aides were overriding any concerns about Biden’s age by emphasizing his opponent’s weakness, including the possibility he could go to prison. Yes, the sentiment in the White House, from the very people who positioned themselves as defenders of American democracy, appears to have been something like: Don’t worry about the president’s senility. The opposition leader will be behind bars soon.<br>With Biden out of office and his decline undeniable - on Sunday, a spokesperson announced the 82-year-old former president has been diagnosed with prostate cancer - Democrats would clearly rather be talking about something else. But changing the subject would be a mistake. A reckoning over this embarrassing scandal is overdue and necessary. Any Democrat who wants to do something about the party’s historically low favorability ratings won’t get very far without one.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R42" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">43</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3757px;left:-1px">SỐNG TRONG MỘT NỀN DÂN CHỦ THÌ..

(Photo by Kena Betancur / AFP via Getty Images)<br>(By James Fallows - The Free Press - 05.18.25 - U.S. Politics)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Here are quick answers to questions I keep receiving about air travel. To start with the most basic on today’s 10-question list:<br>1) Should I worry about a flight through Newark?<br>If the worry is about safety, no. Anything can happen, but anything can happen each time you get out of bed.<br>If the worry is about delays, or a tight connection, or close timing for a big event, yes. Make other plans.<br>United Airlines has already substantially cut back its schedule for its Newark hub. Use it as an example.<br>2) Why should I worry about one thing and not the other?<br>The two answers - don’t worry about safety, do worry about delay -have the same origin: an immediate “better safe than sorry” mindset in the aviation system.<br>Precisely because the U.S. air travel system has just been through its worst air disaster in decades (the collision of a Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet over the Potomac on January 29, 2025), and has ongoing problems in Newark and elsewhere, it is even more safety-focused than usual. As a result it is avoiding some routine shortcuts, and instead taking things extra slow. In practice this amounts to added spacing everywhere: between planes as they taxi, between takeoffs and landings, among planes in cruise and approach, and in other ways.<br>The aviation world is full of mantras on how you travel fastest when you do not rush. In aviation that means: Be hyperdeliberate about checklists, even though you could recite all steps in your sleep. Double-check any clearance or instruction unless you’re absolutely sure. Think ever more carefully about what you’ll do the next time systems go down. It’s the airborne equivalent of waiting for a school crossing guard before stepping onto a road, even when everything looks clear. For the foreseeable future, U.S. aviation will be in crossing-guard mode.<br>3) Why is this happening?<br>The main reason is that we’re at one of the predictable - and long-predicted - failure points at the intersection of economics, politics, human nature, technological progress, and environmental constraints.<br>The intersecting forces, all brought to light by Newark, include:<br>— “Limits to growth” in air travel: There are only so many runways at the biggest airports in the biggest cities, and only so many airplanes that can land at a given time. That’s a physical limit at odds with travelers’ demands to get to popular places at convenient times. Thus approach corridors for hub airports resemble the road traffic below them. Landing at Los Angeles International Airport at 5:00 p.m. becomes like driving on “the 405” at that time. Approaches to the big East Coast airports from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, to Boston Logan International Airport become like I-95 that connects them.<br>In 1997, the renowned writer and aviator William Langewiesche wrote a major story in The Atlantic Monthly that said: “The most pressing issue that air-traffic controllers face is a surge in air traffic without a commensurate expansion of runway availability.”<br>When Langewiesche wrote that story, airline travel had nearly doubled since Jimmy Carter deregulated the industry in the 1970s. And in the subsequent 28 years, daily flights have nearly doubled again, while the number of hub-airport runways has barely changed.<br>— Chronic problems with public infrastructure: Everyone wants better roads - and bridges, tunnels, airports, and rail systems. No one wants to live with the long, slow process of creating them. Or paying for them. These infrastructure projects are far less glamorous counterparts to building the European cathedrals. Completing them spans decades - but political mood and leadership are quicksilver.<br>— Mismatch in tech mindsets: Commercial technology keeps leaping ahead because it can operate on the “we’ll try it in beta” mindset. Move fast and break things; learn from what goes wrong. Life-and-death systems can’t use the public as a beta-test audience. That’s why aviation technology, in particular, will always be a generation behind the latest commercial versions. It’s why the system at the heart of the Newark blackout is only now moving from “copper wire” landline-era connections to the fiber-optic networks familiar in business and consumer systems for decades.<br>— Human nature, which shows up as a mismatch in the supply of talent: As you may have heard, being an air traffic controller can be stressful. Getting, training, and keeping enough controllers has been a challenge in the 44 years since Ronald Reagan fired more than 11,000 striking controllers at once when they refused to return to work. In its final year, the Biden administration bucked a long-term trend by exceeding its hiring targets.<br>4) Didn’t anyone see this coming?<br>Everyone did. Again to use my friend William Langewiesche as an example, in 1997 he laid out the problem, in a piece focused on . . . Newark!<br>    Of the several thousand airplanes aloft during a typical daytime rush, most are headed for the same few cities. . . . This is not merely because those places are where people want to go but also because to stay competitive, airlines need efficient route structures centered on hubs - the now-familiar passenger-exchange airports that by their very nature increase the number of takeoffs and landings.<br>More recently, the most prescient advance-warning coverage I’ve seen is by reporter Will Guisbond, in an aviation-specialist, expensive-subscription-only site called The Air Current. A year ago he was warning about most of what is going wrong in Newark now. The point is: These problems have taken no one in aviation by surprise.<br>5) Okay, but why Newark, and why now?<br>The short answer involves a name that is becoming famous in aviation, “N90.” That is the New York area air traffic control center in charge in charge of traffic flow for the major airports, including Newark, and smaller ones in the region.<br>As part of a yearslong process approved during Donald Trump’s first term, the Newark part of N90 operations center was physically relocated from Long Island to Philadelphia in 2024. The supposed goal was to cut living expenses for controllers, and thus attract more of them. The counterargument was that the move wouldn’t pay off because not enough people would want to relocate. Also, that it would be technologically fragile, and prone to failures like the ones that have now occurred.<br>There’s a tremendous amount more of this history I’m skipping over. Although Trump officials now fall over themselves to blame Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg for screwing up the implementation, the reality is that, like other serious U.S. problems, the responsibility is shared and decades old.<br>Everything You Want To Know About the Air Travel Mess . . .<br>Commercial Jet Aircraft on Final Approach for landing at San Diego Lindbergh Field. (Photo by Bob Riha, Jr./Getty Images)<br>6) Is the Newark problem spreading?<br>In the greater New York area, yes. My pilot chat boards are full of people talking about ripple-effect delays and cancellations throughout nearby “reliever” airports. These are the likes of Teterboro in New Jersey, White Plains in New York, and many smaller ones throughout the region.<br>To return to the freeway analogy, it’s like “surface roads” in New York or Los Angeles getting jammed, as people avoid gridlock on the freeways.<br>7) Will it spread across the country?<br>In exactly the way it’s happened in Newark, probably not. That is because no other major terminal radar approach control (TRACON) facility has been moved. The two-minute radio transmitter failure in Denver, Colorado, last week appears to be a completely unrelated event.<br>But all the other pressure points are nationwide. Delays in one area soon mean delays everywhere else.<br>😎 ‘Who is to blame?’<br>The right thing for me to do at this point would be to skip my standard list of things that Trump, Elon Musk, DOGE, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have done through these past months to erode the air-safety system.<br>If I weren’t skipping the list, it would include:<br>-   Firing FAA employees<br>-   Immediately blaming the Potomac disaster on DEI policies<br>-   Supporting the DOGE assaults on the agencies that keep aviation safe, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service<br>-  Considering a sweetheart deal to switch the FAA’s controller-modernization system from a longstanding Verizon contract to Elon Musk’s Starlink<br>But, as Richard Nixon once put it, “that would be wrong” - that is, to rehash these issues.<br>So I’ll promise to retire this list -  if the Trump-Musk-Duffy team can retire their reflexive claims that everything is Joe Biden’s fault. This genuinely is an all-of-us problem.<br>9) Can this ever get better?<br>Yes. Slowly. Think of every other structural problem in U.S. life: housing patterns; land transport; regional imbalances in opportunity, education, and medical care. They’ve evolved through the decades, and can’t be resolved overnight.<br>And think of the structural achievements in American life. The intercontinental railroads of the mid-19th century. The road system of the early 1900s. The interstates of the mid-20th century. The development of airports and air travel. The spread of telephones and radio and TV and then the internet.<br>All of these involved public-private collaborations. All were imperfect, uneven, often unfair in their benefits. But each was indispensable to the nation’s growth. And all were decades-long in gestation.<br>I try to avoid homilies on the need to be more “bipartisan.” The homily I use instead involves William James’s seminal essay from 1910, “The Moral Equivalent of War.” And the eternal challenge in American politics, as highlighted in that essay, is to do something good for the country, without tying it to an external enemy or threat. That’s part of what we’re dealing with here.<br>10) What can I personally, as a traveler, do?<br>Be patient. That is all. But it’s important. Air travel is going to be slower. And for long trips it’s still pretty fast.<br>In our family we have a saying, which probably originated after a tedious day at the DMV: “Take a book, it’ll be pleasant.”<br>Take a book. Watch a movie. Zen out. Better safe (and slow) than sorry.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R43" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">44</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3457px;left:-1px">MẠNG LƯỚI QUỐC TẾ ĐẦU ĐỘC NƯỚC MỸ<br>Lãnh đạo cơ quan FBI điều trần: dù đã ngăn chặn tại biên giới miền Nam, Hoa Kỳ vẫn bị làn sóng fentanyl đầu độc!

So where&#39;s all the fentanyl coming from? Still? Where&#39;s the trafficking coming from still? Where are all the narco traffickers going to keep bringing this stuff into the country? The northern border. Our adversaries have partnered up with the CCP and others - Russia, Iran - on a variety of different criminal enterprises. And they&#39;re going and they&#39;re sailing around to Vancouver and coming in by air.”<br>Patel asserted that adversarial regimes - including Beijing and Tehran - are now working in tandem on “a variety of different criminal enterprises,” and exploiting what he called the “sheer tyranny of distance” on America’s northern frontier, where vast terrain and lax enforcement in Canada have allegedly enabled fentanyl pipelines and terrorist infiltration.<br>Pointing directly at Carney’s government, Patel continued:<br>“Now we&#39;re focused on it and we&#39;re calling our state and local law enforcement partners up [at the northern border]. But you know, who has to get to step in is Canada - because they&#39;re making it up there and shipping it down here.”<br>The FBI director’s warning - posted on the White House’s X account - follows exclusive reporting by The Bureau and a newly released 2025 threat assessment from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which, for the first time, officially flags Canada as an emerging threat node in the North American drug supply chain.<br>As The Bureau reported earlier this week, the DEA highlighted the dismantling of a fentanyl “super laboratory” in October 2024 in Falkland, British Columbia - a mountainous corridor between Vancouver and Calgary - as an emerging threat in fentanyl trafficking targeting the United States. Sources pointed to the same converged threat networ - China, Iran, and Mexico - mentioned today by FBI Director Kash Patel.<br>“According to these sources,” The Bureau reported Friday, “the site forms part of a broader criminal convergence involving Chinese, Mexican, and Iranian networks operating across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. The Bureau’s sources indicate that the Falkland facility was connected to Chinese chemical exporters sanctioned by the United States Treasury, Iranian threat actors, and operatives from Mexican drug cartels.”<br>In his remarks today, Patel appeared to directly link this criminal convergence to terrorist infiltration.<br>“And I’ll give you a statistic that I gave to Congress that nobody was paying attention to,” Patel added. “Over 300 known or suspected terrorists crossed into this country last year, illegally… 85 percent of them came in through the northern border.”<br>Patel also appeared to turn up the political pressure on Ottawa, alluding to President Trump’s recent controversial statements about Canada - which became a flashpoint in the federal election, with many voters embracing the Liberal Party’s campaign framing Carney as a bulwark against Trump.<br>“I don&#39;t care about getting into this debate about making someone the 51st state or not,” Patel said, referencing Trump’s remarks. “But [Canada] are a partner in the north. And say what you want about Mexico - but they helped us seal the southern border. But facts speak for themselves. It’s the [northern] border that&#39;s open.”<br>The Bureau will continue to follow this story in the coming week.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R44" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">45</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/18/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:4391px;left:-1px">IRAN LẠI BẮT TRỚN LÀM BOM HẠCH TÂM NHƯ BẮC HÀN<br>Vì Donald Trump lại bắt chước nghệ thuật của Bill Clinton 30 năm trước: nạp tiền cho lãnh đạo Iran tiến hành việc đó căn cứ trên lời hứa đáng tin bằng Thằng Cuội.<br>Trên Gatestone Institute, học giả am hiểu là Majid Rafizadeh kể lại chuyện đó, như ‘Art of the Deal’ của bọn sát nhân sau khi chúng cho Giáo chủ Donald Dumb húp mật ong...<br>https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/.../iran-using-north...<br>Iran Is Using North Korea&#39;s Playbook - And the US Is Falling for It Again<br>(by Majid Rafizadeh - Gatestone Institute - May 17, 2025)<br>* Iran appears to be using diplomacy to stall, deceive and advance its nuclear capabilities behind closed doors, while securing financial and geopolitical concessions from the West.<br>* The disturbing part is not that Iran&#39;s mullahs are following their usual tactics.

The horror is that American officials and Western leaders appear to be falling for this shell-game all over again.<br>To understand how dangerously naïve the apparent US approach is, one only needs to revisit the trajectory of North Korea&#39;s nuclear program. In the early 1980s, North Korea under Kim Il Sung began developing nuclear technology under the pretense - of course - of producing only peaceful civilian nuclear energy. The international community - credulous hopeful and thrilled to avoid confrontation - pursued negotiations. The result was the 1994 &quot;Agreed Framework&quot; under President Bill Clinton, in which North Korea agreed to freeze its plutonium weapons program in exchange for aid, oil shipments and help with building light-water nuclear reactors.<br>U.S. officials celebrated it as a diplomatic victory. As the West congratulated itself, North Korea quietly advanced its nuclear weapons program to the goal line. By the time Washington discovered the deception, North Korea had successfully negotiated enough time to become a nuclear-armed state.<br>In 2006, North Korea shocked the world by conducting its first successful nuclear detonation. Today, North Korea possesses dozens of nuclear warheads and a large stockpile of ballistic missiles, including ICBMs capable of hitting cities in the continental United States. This is the true legacy of negotiating with tyrannical regimes.<br>The problem with enriching hostile regimes to &quot;buy quiet&quot; is that this is the money they use to build nuclear weapons with which to attack us.<br>With Iran, the parallel is pronounced. Iran&#39;s clandestine nuclear weapons program was first publicly exposed in 2002 by the National Council of Resistance of Iran, a dissident group that revealed the existence of secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Arak. This revelation set off more than two decades of international efforts - diplomatic pressure, United Nations sanctions, and multiple rounds of talks, talks, talks - aimed at halting the regime&#39;s nuclear plans. Western governments, doggedly convinced they can negotiate their way to security, repeatedly return to the table.<br>Under President Barack Obama, the United States proudly spearheaded the disastrous 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which, according to the Obama administration, would &quot;prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,&quot; in exchange for sanctions relief. Unfortunately, the deal included a sunset clause &quot;loophole&quot;: In just a few years - which would have ended this October - Iran would have legitimately been able to have as many nuclear weapons as it could acquire, along with the missiles to deliver them.<br>The administration heralded the deal as a historic breakthrough, but the facts – including the sunset clause provision - tell a different story.<br>Meanwhile, Iran&#39;s leaders pocketed billions in sanctions relief, which they funneled into their military, their regional proxies, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. After reaping the benefits, Iran ramped up uranium enrichment to 60%, expelled international inspectors, and threatened to go beyond every previous red line. Just last week, satellite surveillance discovered yet another secret nuclear site in Iran.<br>An additional problem, unfortunately, is that the Iranian regime has a well-documented history of lying (here, here, here and here).<br>Two and a half decades have passed since the world first discovered Iran&#39;s nuclear weapons ambitions, and where are we? Iran is closer than ever to developing a nuclear bomb, if it has not done so already. According to recent reports, Iran possesses enough highly enriched uranium to build at least six nuclear weapons in a matter of weeks. Iran has developed advanced centrifuges, hardened its underground facilities, and honed its ballistic missile program. In other words, Iran&#39;s strategy has been working: feign interest in diplomacy, delay enforcement, outmaneuver weak foreign leaders, and emerge as a nuclear-armed state.<br>Despite this damning record, Western leaders continue to pretend that a new round of talks will yield different results. Even now, Iranian negotiators insist on their &quot;inalienable right&quot; to enrich uranium, and have refused any deal that would fully dismantled the country&#39;s nuclear infrastructure. This response should tell us everything we need to know. No deal that permits any level of enrichment or allows Iran to keep its centrifuges intact will prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. Washington nevertheless continues to play this dangerous game, hoping that the mullahs will prefer complete dismantlement to &quot;Plan B.&quot;<br>There has been not even been a firm timeline. President Donald Trump&#39;s original ultimatum to Iran of &quot;two months&quot; from March 7, 2025, is long gone. This statement, intended to show strength and resolution, is the second ultimatum Trump has blown through since taking office in January 2025. The first was that Hamas had to release all the Israeli hostages it holds in Gaza by a certain date, &quot;or all hell is going to break out.&quot; Well, one hostage was released - the American one - while leaving the other hostages with Hamas, but no hell broke out. That makes strike two. So much for America&#39;s credibility. As the late renowned Middle East historian Bernard Lewis is credited as having said, &quot;America is harmless as an enemy but treacherous as a friend.&quot;<br>Iran&#39;s theocratic regime openly chants &quot;Death to America&quot; and &quot;Death to Israel.&quot; It no doubt plans to continue sponsoring terrorism, crushing dissent at home, seeking regional and global hegemony and &quot;death&quot; to both of its Satans. Hoping that such a regime will actually voluntarily disarm is most likely based on assumptions that are wobbly at best.<br>What makes the current situation even more exasperating is that despite decades of talks, deals and diplomatic theater with North Korea, Russia, China and Iran, we have watched them exploit Western weakness and lack of resolve time and again right under our noses. Yet, like Charlie Brown and the football, the West insists on accepting the same failed, bogus guarantees. We do not need another Swiss-cheese agreement filled with loopholes. We do not need photo-ops and press conferences proclaiming bogus triumphs. America needs a serious, uncompromising strategy that actually eliminates Iran&#39;s nuclear capabilities - permanently and completely: no centrifuges, no missiles, no uranium enrichment.<br>We are trying to &quot;deal&quot; with theocrats who believe it is their divine duty to destroy Israel and America, and take over the oil-rich states in the Persian Gulf.<br>Iran&#39;s mullahs have played us long enough.

Today, now that I have a much better understanding of processes driving historical dynamics, I realize that the overwhelming majority of these novels took place during the disintegrative (crisis) periods. As an example, two of my favorite novels were La Reine Margot by Alexandre Dumas and A Chronicle of the Reign of Charles IX by Prosper Mérimée. Both describe intraelite conflicts during the French Wars of Religion (hereafter the FWR).<br>Henry of Navarre and Margaret of Valois Source<br>I asked ChatGPT to give me a one-sentence explanation of the causes of this bloody and lengthy civil war. Here’s what it said: “The French Wars of Religion were primarily caused by growing tensions between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots) in France, fueled by religious intolerance, political rivalries among noble families, and a weak monarchy unable to maintain order.” This answer perfectly encapsulates the standard story as seen in popular historical books, or online encyclopedias (LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are great at summarizing such common wisdom).<br>Readers of my books and blog posts would immediately realize that Cliodynamics gives a very different answer. Noble rivalries and religious tensions were what happened on the surface. But the deep structural causes of the FWR were popular immiseration, elite overproduction leading to intraelite conflict, and fiscal collapse of the state. In other words, the usual suspects when we talk about structural-demographic crises.<br>The Day of the Barricades (Paris, 1588), an ostensibly spontaneous popular uprising, which was in reality organized by counter-elites Source<br>What I’d like to do in this post series is delve a bit into these structural causes (for a deeper dive read Chapter 5 of Secular Cycles). I have two reasons to do so. First, the onset of the FWR gives us a nearly perfect example of how structural-demographic trends lead to state collapse and civil wars. Second, it was the fiscal collapse of the state that triggered warfare in c.1560. I wrote about the possibility of such a trigger for the America today in a recent post, where I concluded that we are fairly immune against it. But France in the sixteenth century was, most emphatically, not immune.<br>The ultimate driver, as usual in agrarian states, was population growth. During the integrative phase of the cycle (1450 to 1560) the population of France doubled: from 10–11 to 20–22 million. The French Kingdom in the sixteenth century was an overwhelmingly agrarian state and agricultural productivity couldn’t keep up with such massive population growth. As a result, food prices exploded. The price of a setier (a measure of volume) of wheat in livres tournois (the standard monetary unit in early-modern France) increased 10-fold between the 1460s and 1560s. Overpopulation created a high demand for food, inflating its price, and it increased the supply of labor, deflating its price. During the sixteenth century real wages lost two-thirds or more of their buying capacity. The daily wage of the Parisian laborer could buy 16 kg of grain in the 1490s, compared to less than 4 kg one century later.<br>Real wage in France, 1450–1700, in kg of grain per day. The real wage is calculated by taking an average of the wages paid to laborers and craftsmen in Paris, as reported by Allen (2001), and deflating them with the price of wheat (Abel 1980). Source: Chapter 5 of Secular Cycles.<br>While the general population immiserated, land-owning elites prospered, as the products of land, such as grain, increased in price, while the price of labor decreased. This favorable economic conjuncture for the elites resulted in two related developments. First, growing inequality among commoners meant that although the great majority of them were sinking into misery, a small minority, profiting from low wages, did very well and acquired substantial wealth. These well-to-do commoners, wealthy farmers and merchants, naturally aspired to translate their wealth into elite status. Many such elite aspirants succeeded, generating a steady inflow into the ranks of nobility.<br>Second, many noble families started to provide substantial inheritances to their younger sons. This practice led to estate subdivision and multiplication of nobles. For example, one of the richest French magnates, François de la Trémoille (1502–42) had to provide for five sons (and dowries for two daughters).<br>Driven by upward mobility and estate subdivision the numbers of nobles increased dramatically during the sixteenth century. For example, the numbers of the top elite stratum (pairs laïques—lay peers) tripled between1505 and 1588 (more detail in Part II of this series).<br>An inevitable result of this increase was intensifying intraelite competition for status and wealth. One way we can gage increasing pressures on the elites is by the incidence of intraelite violence, which during this period took the form of dueling. Dueling had almost disappeared in France during the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Under François I and Henri II a handful of judicial duels took place with royal sanction.<br>The duel between Jarnac and La Châtaignerie (1547). Henri II presides. The two combatants were members of the rival elite factions, Montmorency and Guise (more on this in the next installment) Source<br>After 1560, however, dueling for personal honor and without royal sanction became so common that it was believed that more noblemen died from it than in combat. Between 7,000 to 8,000 nobles were killed in the two last decades of the sixteenth century. It was said that Henri IV granted over 6,000 pardons for the killing of gentlemen in duels during just the first ten years of the seventeenth century.<br>Of course, duels loom large in the historical romances I read as a boy.<br>In the next installment, we will see how intraelite competition and conflicts led to the collapse of the Renaissance state in France.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R47" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">48</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/17/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2357px;left:-1px">ĐÁNG LẼ TRUMP NÊN CÂM!<br>Chỉ nói Tối Cao Pháp Viện sẽ quyết định về một vấn đề hệ trọng của nước Mỹ.

Instead, the justices will likely decide on whether the nationwide injunctions blocked the policy too much.<br>U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court on May 15 that judges were exceeding the authority granted to them under Article III of the Constitution. On the other side, New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum defended the blocks on Trump’s policy.<br>Birthright citizenship comes from the 14th Amendment and refers to the idea that certain people receive U.S. citizenship by virtue of being born in the country. While Trump’s critics have said this guarantee extends to the children of illegal immigrants, Republicans have argued the amendment requires parents to have some kind of allegiance to the country before their children receive citizenship.<br>On the day of the hearing, Trump said on Truth Social that “Birthright Citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent Citizens of the United States of America, and bringing their families with them, all the time laughing at the “SUCKERS” that we are!”<br>The Supreme Court’s eventual decision could include more tentative observations about the policy’s constitutionality, potentially teeing up a more conventional Supreme Court hearing about the 14th Amendment and federal law.<br>In the meantime, the justices’ thoughts about the constitutionality could help them determine whether a nationwide block was appropriate. For example, if they thought the children of illegal immigrants faced irreparable harm from a denial of a purported constitutional right to citizenship.<br>Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan seemed to be the most critical of Trump’s order. “As far as I see it, this order violates four Supreme Court precedents,” Sotomayor told Sauer.<br>Justice Clarence Thomas offered remarks indicating he was open to points made by Sauer, who suggested nationwide injunctions didn’t emerge in the judiciary until the 1960s. “So we survived until the 1960s without universal injunctions?” Thomas, who has criticized nationwide injunctions as “historically dubious,” asked.<br>By contrast, Sotomayor suggested that “we’ve had universal injunctions in some form … since the founding.”<br>A ruling that bars nationwide injunctions could change how judges, attorneys, and politicians approach policies. Some of the justices’ questions indicated they were concerned about what would replace nationwide injunctions.<br>Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that class actions, or lawsuits in which multiple plaintiffs sue on behalf of a larger group of plaintiffs, could take the place of nationwide injunctions. If nationwide injunctions were not available in this case, people could file class actions, which could “solve a large part of the problem in a way that complies with the rules,” the justice said.<br>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the government’s proposal to curtail nationwide injunctions would make it more difficult for people to sue to vindicate their rights. “Your argument seems to turn our justice system … into a ‘catch me if you can’ kind of regime … where everybody has to have a lawyer and file a lawsuit in order for the government to stop violating people’s rights,” she told Sauer.<br>Sauer disagreed, saying that given the status quo, “the ‘catch me if you can’ problem operates in the opposite direction where we have the government racing from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, having to sort of clear the table in order to implement a new policy.”<br>George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley said on social media that the issue “could be a nail-biter.” He added that he thought “the Administration still has an advantage in curtailing universal injunctions” but that he “did not come away with the senes of a lock with a majority.”<br>If the justices rule against Trump, it could amplify already brewing tensions between the executive and judiciary, which is wrestling with a long list of challenges to Trump’s policies.

As you will see, he helps explain how we reached this somewhat fraught place in world history. So let’s jump in…<br>1/ A Geopolitical Tale: <br>How We Got Where We Are by George Friedman<br>This is the story of how we got to a moment in history defined by global and national crises. It is the story about how a radical geopolitical transition is taking place as old socio-economic and institutional cycles in the US end and new ones begin. But there is also a massive global geopolitical crisis taking place. The story is long and complex. I wish it were shorter, but the complexities are such that there is no way to tell it simply. It began 80 years ago and brings us to our current crises. We are in the storm before the calm, and it’s as intense as storms can be.<br>During the Cold War, the geopolitical system had an anchor: the confrontation between the United States and Soviet Union. All other nations had three options. They could align with the US, align with the Soviet Union, or be neutral. This did not define all international activity, of course, but the Cold War set the rules around which international activity took place. The Cold War was based on the assumption that a Russian invasion of Western Europe was a genuine threat to the US, and that NATO and US forces were therefore indispensable. If anything, they might have been insufficient to stop a determined Russian assault, or so the thinking went.<br>The Cold War did not end with the fall of communism; it ended with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Some say Russia intended only to seize the parts of Ukraine it now holds. But this belies the nature of the invasion. Russia invaded Ukraine on four axes: an attack from the east, a second thrust from the north down the country’s center, a third from the north meant to occupy the capital, and a fourth one from the south. It was an all-out attack whose only purpose was to occupy the whole of Ukraine. Had Russia’s intentions been more measured, Moscow might have massed its forces against Eastern Ukraine. But that isn’t what it did.<br>This is important to the new geopolitical reality because the Russian invasion, in no uncertain terms, failed. It failed so badly that Vladimir Putin sent in mercenaries from the Wagner Group to bolster Russia’s conventional military. The mercenaries feuded with, but were not completely under the command of, Russian military leaders. So bad was the animosity between them that the Wagner Group staged an insurrection against Putin. This, too, failed, leading to the group leader’s death in a plane crash some weeks later.<br>Russia’s failure to rapidly subdue Ukraine, a much smaller and seemingly weaker country, was the point at which the Cold War really ended. After three years of war, it was clear that Russia was not the threat many had believed. Ukraine may have been receiving weapons and supplies from the West, but there were no Western troops on the ground. It became clear that the foundation of the Cold War - the Russian capacity to invade and occupy Western Europe - was not possible without radical reconstruction that would take many years to achieve. And perhaps not even then. The war in Ukraine showed that Russia could not invade and occupy Europe.<br>From the 1940s to the 1990s, the US justified its defense of Europe on moral grounds. It was framed as liberal democracy against tyrannical communism. This was true but not the whole truth, which lay in the geopolitical imperatives of the US - imperatives deeply embedded in US strategic reality. That reality rested on US geography.<br>The US is the dominant power in North America by massive degrees. It is one of the few countries in the world - and the only major power - that cannot be invaded by land. To the north is Canada, to the south Mexico, and neither is a conceivable military threat. Any threat to the US mainland would have come from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, which are more reliable as buffers to attack than a source of it.<br>In 1890, Adm. Alfred Thayer Mahan wrote a book called “The Influence of Sea Power upon History,” which is the intellectual foundation of US grand strategy to this day. US national security, he argued, depends on command of the sea. So long as there is no threat in the Atlantic or Pacific, US security is assured. And by logical extension, the US does not have an interest in the Eastern Hemisphere.<br>Thus the US did not get involved in World War I until U-Boats started attacking Atlantic shipping lanes and sank the Lusitania, at the cost of many American lives. The US joined the war to block the German navy from accessing the Atlantic. Years later, Washington passed the Lend-Lease Act, an agreement with Britain aimed at making sure Germany didn’t invade, defeat, or take control of the Royal Navy and, in doing so, challenge the US. In fact, there was a proviso in the agreement that said that in the event of British capitulation to Germany, the Royal Navy would move to North America. Only after all this, when Japan devastated the American Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, did Washington conduct a strategy to drive Japan out of the Pacific.<br>The US approached the Soviet Union from an ideological position, but the fundamental geopolitical reality was that if Moscow took Western Europe, it would be able to hold Atlantic ports, construct a significant navy, and threaten the US via the Atlantic. In the third world, now called the Global South, the US and Russians competed for the most part through proxies for dominance. Neither really wanted dominance, but neither did they want the other to dominate. All of this dissolved with the outcome of the war in Ukraine. Now that it is unanchored by the Cold War, the US faces a new geopolitical reality that is redefining the global system and America’s place in it.<br>The end of the Cold War means the Russian threat to the Atlantic is gone. From the US perspective, China is a threat in the Pacific, but it is a future threat because it lacks the naval capabilities to control the seas. China cannot, for example, reliably navigate warships through waters in ready range of US drones. Even if its navy could break into the Pacific at some point, the ability of its vessels to return to base for supplies - or for supplies to reach the vessels - in amphibious operations would be a high risk.<br>The US has, then, returned to a familiar geopolitical reality: It controls the Atlantic, and there is only a limited threat in the Pacific. It has rebuilt its national security on its former foundations. The US has command of the seas, and its geopolitical imperative in Europe and the Third World has been achieved. The US national strategy must change accordingly, and the change is radical. Since the end of World War II, the US has been heavily involved in the Eastern Hemisphere. In Europe, it stood guard against Russia. In the Pacific, it built alliances with nations and islands to limit China’s access to the Pacific in the event of war.<br>Source: Geopolitical Futures [Sẽ yết bản đồ sau]<br>The US no longer needs a major forward deployment on the ground in Europe and needs only minimal exposure in the Pacific. Nor does the US feel the need to block Russian influence in the Global South. In other words, the need the US once felt to deploy major forces on a global basis is gone because the geopolitics of the Cold War are gone. The current US geopolitical imperative is to minimize the risk and cost of extensive engagement in the security of the Eastern Hemisphere. What was unthinkable for 80 years is now rational.<br>Russia’s greatest weakness was its economy. America’s greatest strength was its economy. The Russians might be able to guarantee the security of a nation, but not its economic growth or well-being. US strategy, therefore, had two dimensions: the martial and the economic. This was first made clear in the Marshall Plan, which was pivotal in resurrecting European economies. It also gave NATO members, for example, an opportunity to recreate their militaries and array them against the Russian threat. In creating this program, and then in creating an economic system that allowed them access to the powerful American market, the US used economic strategies to improve the internal security of militarily allied countries. This strategy was pursued geopolitically in the competition of the US and Russia in the Global South. Access to the Russian market was limited by both Russian policy and necessity. A relationship with Russia did not bring economic rewards. The US used foreign aid and access to American markets as an incentive to governments and the public to remain in the American sphere of influence. The method, beyond foreign aid, was in allowing the United States to maintain negative balances of trade with many countries.<br>Given the geopolitical situation, it was a cost-effective strategy, much cheaper than waging war, which in many cases was waged anyway. First, the US resurrected former enemies such as Japan to have favorable access to the American economy. “Made in Japan” was a common substitute for cheap and poorly made products. But it helped rebuild Japan as it did Europe and turned it into a military asset of bases and cooperation. Again, the US policy of ready access to US markets and initial aid was a powerful geopolitical tool Russia didn’t have. It was instrumental in winning the Cold War. Now this strategy is obsolete.<br>Two things are happening in tandem. First, the United States is abandoning or at least weakening its military obligations to other countries, and in doing so it is reducing the risk of becoming engaged in foreign wars, something that had been the norm in the past. Second, the United States is trying to equalize its balance of trade with the rest of the world. It was happy to float imbalances for decades, but it no longer believes that that’s a price worth paying.<br>Consider the case of China. China and Russia had hostile relations when they were both communist countries. At about the same time, Henry Kissinger went to China on his famous mission to establish relations, Russia was attacking China along their shared border on the Ussuri River. This and countless previous conflicts like it show the limits of ideology in geopolitics.<br>After Mao’s death and China’s adoption of controlled capitalism, China began to take Japan’s place as a low-cost, low-quality exporter. The decision to open up its economy was one of the key factors in China’s breakneck economic growth in the late 20th century. Many in the US saw US engagement with China as tantamount to strengthening an enemy. But two considerations took precedence: The US had become addicted to low-cost exports, and engaging China would further drive a wedge between China and Russia.<br>Central to the China policy was massive investment. China had economic relations with many countries, of course, but the US had (and still has) the largest economy in the world, so access to its markets would be vital for a growing economy such as China’s. Its economy would continue to boom until the late 2010s, when several structural issues and the COVID-19 pandemic slowed growth considerably. Geopolitical shifts are rapid in the face of outright war or economic catastrophe. They are slower when neither is present.<br>The United States now has three imperatives: end the social crisis of the culture wars; repair the economic realities that have become obsolete; and transform an obsolete institutional system. The socio-economic cycle transitions about every 50 years, the institutional cycles every 80 years. But there is no cycle in geopolitics. It happens when it happens, and it is happening now. This is therefore an intense period as major systems become obsolescent and thus create a crisis, followed by a political storm that disrupts the obsolete systems, followed by a new, engineered reality, and then ending with a calm after the storm. What has happened is all these cycles are hitting at once, and their convergence has led to a period of unusual intensity.<br>The US has a geopolitical imperative to disengage from the risks and burdens imposed by its involvement in wars globally. Reducing geopolitical risk involves reducing economic exposure to the world and military responsibility. One of the foundations of economic relations was a substantial imbalance in trade, the justification for which is now obsolete.<br>American security posture shifted over the course of the Ukraine war, when the failure of Russia to defeat Ukraine completely ended the Cold War’s foundational logic. In turn, this led to a shift in security policy as well as a massive shift in economic policy and the United States’ attitude towards free trade. Meanwhile, the end of the Cold War has created a crisis in Europe, which likewise has to redefine itself after 80 years of the status quo. The need is now for the United States to disengage to some significant extent from its global economic policy.<br>The US’s dramatic introduction of massive tariffs is thus geopolitically driven. Its method is an engineering decision intended to break the old system and open the door for a new one. It created a geopolitical crisis by its engineering.<br>Here again, China is a useful example. The US has troubled relations with China. The geopolitical problem is mitigated by the economic problem, but with the Cold War over, the cost is no longer essential. The economic problem with China has been integrated with the geopolitical. Relatively free trade with China achieved a geopolitical purpose but weakened the American economy in two ways: Lower labor costs allowed for cheap exports and for the relocation of businesses to China. But the problems went deeper than that. The US became dependent on imports of key components, sometimes entire alternatives, to US production. If those were cut off, it would create a massive crisis that would require Washington to revive domestic production of finished products and essential components alike.<br>US-Chinese relations may have been poor, but they were never so bad as to threaten war. China could choose to place the US into a very dangerous position, not unlike the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s. A war was fought by Egypt and Syria against Israel in 1973. The attackers were supplied by Russia, the Israelis by the US. Israel’s victory produced anti-US anger in the Arab world. Arab oil producers, who provided the US with a substantial portion of its oil, then imposed an embargo. This came at a great cost to the Arabs, but the geopolitics of the Arab world forced their hand. The loss of an essential energy import pushed the United States into a massive economic crisis. It was a case in which geopolitical necessity overrode economic considerations.<br>China exports essential industrial components to the United States. It is also a geopolitical competitor with the United States. If events force China to accept economic and financial costs for geopolitical advantage, it could talk itself into imposing an embargo. This results in a massive geopolitical vulnerability for the US. In addition to wanting to change economic relationships on a global level, the US urgently needed to do so first with China.<br>US efforts to distance itself from the rest of the world have predictably caused internal and external turmoil. Done more slowly, it would have caused merely long-term unease. Unease and turmoil are both parts of obsolete geopolitical models. The evolution of those models is both disruptive and poorly understood because of the perception that the forces of geopolitical necessity seem less deterministic than the forces behind economics.<br>But the truth - and this is the point of this story - is that the forces of humanity as a whole generate impersonal pressures that overwhelm human preferences as they define reality. The transition to new realities was less bloody than the end of the European age in 1945 and the emergence of the American age. But on the other hand, it did not change the fundamental geopolitical reality. Where Europe was replaced as the center of the world, the US remains the center, so the turmoil is not the beginning of the storm, but the last storm before the new calm.<br>***<br>John here again.

Plus, every so often, a walk through history to explain why the day is what it is. Frankly, it is one of the lowest-cost but essential analytical services that I read. Click here to subscribe and learn why I and thousands of others find George and his team indispensable.<br>2/ Dallas, West Palm Beach, and DC<br>I will be in Dallas in two weeks, then likely West Palm Beach and DC after that as we continue opening clinics within the next few weeks. I will give you more details when they are actually open.<br>It has been a busy week with the SIC. My daughter Tiffani is also here. She worked with me for almost 15 years before taking a sabbatical, and as the idea for opening a new type of longevity clinic with Dr. Mike Roizen began to emerge, I asked her to shift her career and come back to explore the economics and reality of what it would take. In one sense, the business and science are straightforward. In another real sense, the medical world is every bit as regulated as the investment world, and I am having to learn whole new terminologies in legal documents, along with the usual complexities of starting any new business. We have a growing team and I’m learning a lot. It is good to be challenged and to work with people you like. Lots of new tricks for this old dog.<br>And with that, I will hit the send button. You have a great week. I will spend much of this weekend reviewing the SIC transcripts and thinking about how that impacts pretty much everything I do. On Friday I will interview Howard Marks and Joe Lonsdale. Both are friends but it is still intimidating to do it in front of thousands of people. I am glad that Ed D’Agostino is shouldering a lot of the moderation at this SIC. He excels at it in a way that I never would. Like I said, it’s good to have a team.<br>Your busier than ever analyst,<br>John Mauldin <br>Thoughts from the Frontline</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R49" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">50</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/17/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3057px;left:-1px">TỔNG THỐNG PHẠM TỘI TỐNG TIỀN VỀ CHÍNH TRỊ?<br>Khồng! Chính trường Hoa Kỳ nào có đơn giản như vậy? Thế… Tống tiền Tổng thống về Chính trị, mà ai tống tiền? Cũng chưa đúng, sự thể nó... Mỹ hơn nhiều! <br>Sự thể lưu manh và trắng trợn là nỗ lực ngấm ngầm của thành phần ưu tú về truyền thông chung quanh hành lang chính trị của một tổng thống hết sáng suốt!.. Quý vị đọc câu tóm lược trên thì giật mình đọc lại mà vẫn không thể hiểu nổi. Chỉ vì chúng ta cần một pho sách về sự sa đọa lan rộng giữa nhiều người, và kéo dài trong nhiều năm, của siêu cường dân chủ nhất thế giới. Đâm ra chữ dân chủ là một mỉa mai. <br>Đó là thực tế lưu cữu của đảng Dân Chủ song hành với truyền thông cánh tả! Không có hơn trăm chữ dẫn nhập, quý vị sẽ khó thấy ra nỗ lực của giáo sư Jonathan Turley khi trình bày một sự kinh hoàng có thật tại Hoa Kỳ vừa mới được tòa án cho công khai hóa….<br>Một tổng thống đương nhiệm đã tàng trữ ngổn ngang từng thùng tài liệu mật ở nơi này nơi khác suốt mấy năm trong tư thất tại một tiểu bang khác nên mới bị điều tra. Trong hai ngày phỏng vấn vào Tháng 10, 2023 của luật sư có thẩm quyền, Tổng thống Mỹ là Joe Biden quanh co nói trước quên sau như người mất trí - vì thật sự mất trí. Viên luật sư thực hiện việc điều ra bèn kết luận: nếu ra trước tòa, bồi thẩm đoàn cũng khó kết tội một người có vẻ dễ thương đầy thiện chí, mà già nua và mất trí nhớ. Nôm na là không nên kết tội.<br>Tất nhiên, nhiều người không đồng ý với kết luận đó. <br>Nhưng truyền thông và giới chính trị của Phủ Tổng thống không đồng ý rằng lãnh đạo Hoa Kỳ lại là một ông già mất trí. Họ là tập thể ồn ào ráo riết bao che sự thật khi hệ thống chính trị đương quyền lại tấp nập truy tố cựu Tổng thống Donald Trump cũng về tội tàng trữ tài liệu ở tại nhà trong mục tiêu tống tiền chính trị!<br>Cho tới Tháng Bảy 2024, trong cuộc tranh luận duy nhất của cuộc bầu cử tổng thống giữa hai ứng cử viên Trump và Biden thì cả thế giới chứng kiến tình trạng tâm thần của Tổng thống Biden. Mà từ Tháng 10 2023 đến sau này, Bộ Tư Pháp của Chính quyền Biden không cho phép công bố nội dung cuộc phỏng vấn của luật sư Robert Hur như đã được yêu cầu.<br>Bây giờ, cuộc phỏng vấn vừa trở thành công khai đã công khai hóa một chuỗi tội ác là toa rập với nhau để che giấu sự thật về Joe Biden. Những ai toa rập? Đông lắm. Vì mục đích gì? Nhiều lắm…<br>Xin quý vị thưởng thức nghệ thuật trình bày một kỳ án chính trị của nền dân chủ đang mưng mủ tèm lem - từ trên đầu! <br>Và sẽ thành đầu sách để hái ra tiền. <br>https://jonathanturley.org/.../for-posteritys-sake-why.../<br>“For Posterity’s Sake”: Why the Biden-Hur Tapes is a Virtual Racketeering Indictment<br>Erin Scott/White House via Flickr/Public Domain<br>(Jonathan Turley - Columns, Justice, Media, Politics - May 17, 2025) <br>“For posterity’s sake.” Those words from President Joe Biden sum up the crushing impact of the leaked audiotapes from the interview between then-President Joe Biden and Special Counsel Robert Hur. <br>Not only did they remove any serious doubt over Biden committing the federal crimes charged against President Donald Trump, but they also constituted what is akin to a political racketeering indictment against much of the Washington establishment.<br>The interview from Oct. 8-9, 2023, has long been sought by Congress, but was kept under wraps by the government even as Biden campaigned for a second term.<br>Many of us balked at Hur’s conclusion that no charges were appropriate despite the fact that the President removed classified material for decades, stored it in grossly negligent ways, and moved it around to unsecure locations, including his garage in Delaware.<br>Given President Donald Trump’s indictment for the same offenses, it was hard to imagine how the Special Counsel could not recommend the same criminal charges (presumably after he left office).<br>Instead, Hur declared it would have been hard to get a jury to convict Biden because he was “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”<br>It appears that Trump, on the other hand, was presumptively not sympathetic or well-meaning and possessed a good memory for prosecution.<br>The contrast was glaring and only reinforced the view of many citizens that there are two tracks for justice in Washington.<br>Soon after the report’s release, President Biden gave an irate press conference in which he lied about the findings of his culpability and lashed out at any suggestion that he had gapped or stumbled in the interview.<br>For example, when reporters raised how Biden forgot when his son Beau died, Biden angrily responded, “How in the hell dare he raise that?” Frankly, when I was asked the question I thought to myself it wasn’t any of their damn business.”<br>However, it was not Hur but Biden himself who raised the death of his son, and he forgot a wide array of dates, including when he served in office.<br>The interview shows that in 2023 it was clear that Biden was mentally diminished despite claims from many allies and former aides that there was a sudden loss of capacity just before the disastrous debate in 2024.  It is now undeniable that the White House staff actively hid the president’s incompetence from the American public. That includes the White House press secretary Jen Psaki (who left her post in May 2022) and Karine Jean-Pierre who insisted that Biden was sharp and “running circles” around the staff.<br>Of course, the media is now covering the story after the public saw the truth in the debate. Figures like CNN’s Jake Tapper have even written books that belatedly pursue the question despite previously insisting that there was no evidence of a diminishment in Biden’s mental state.<br>Tapper repeatedly dismissed the claim and even mocked Lara Trump for raising it. In one interview, he pushed a White House talking point that such suggestions were mocking Biden for a childhood stutter:<br>“It’s so amazing to me- a ‘cognitive decline.’ I think you were mocking his stutter. Yeah. I think you were mocking his stutter and I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody’s cognitive decline. I would think somebody in the Trump family would be more sensitive to people who do not have medical licenses diagnosing politicians from afar.”<br>When Lara Trump insisted that this was clearly evidence of a “very concerning” cognitive decline, Tapper dismissed her statement by saying  “Thank you, Lara. I’m sure it’s from a place of concern. We all believe that.”<br>Keep in mind that others beyond Lara Trump were raising this issue and there were tapes showing physical and mental diminishment. The media simply refused to seriously pursue the story until the cover-up no longer mattered after the debate.<br>Over on MSNBC, Joe Scarborough was equally apoplectic at those raising the issue and stated<br>    “start your tape right now because I’m about to tell you the truth. And F— you if you can’t handle the truth. This version of Biden intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever. Not a close second. And I have known him for years…If it weren’t the truth I wouldn’t say it<br>This media effort continued all the way up to the debate itself. On CNN, Oliver Darcy wrote, “Right-wing media figures are desperately pushing conspiracy theories about Biden ahead of the debate.”<br>Once the public found out, the media was ready to tell the story when there was no longer any advance or ability to deny it. Articles began to appear with the same realization of “Oh you meant THAT mental decline. Well sure.”<br>It was the same belated acknowledgment that came, after the election, with Hunter Biden’s laptop. The media just moved on with a shrug and a collective “our bad” concession.<br>As for the President himself, the one moment of clarity in the interview may have been his most incriminating line. When asked why he removed classified material on Afghanistan, Biden admitted “I guess I wanted to hang on to it for posterity’s sake.”<br>That is precisely what critics on CNN and MSNBC accused Trump of doing: removing material as types of keepsakes or trophies.<br>One president was indicted for that and one was sent along his way to a second term in office.<br>The real indictment that comes out of these tapes is a type of political racketeering enterprise by the Washington establishment. It took a total team effort from Democratic politicians to the White House staff to the media to hide the fact that the President of the United States was mentally diminished. If there were a political RICO crime, half of Washington would be frog-marched to the nearest federal courthouse.<br>Of course, none of this complicity in the cover-up is an actual crime. It is part of the Washington racket.<br>After all, this is Washington, where such duplicity results not in plea deals but book deals.<br>___<br>(Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and the author of “The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage.”)<br>This column ran in Fox com</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R50" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">51</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/16/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2357px;left:-1px">LẠC ĐỀ VÀ LẠC QUẺ!<br>Như tiếng vọng từ đáy vực của kẻ làm mối vô duyên, Trump kêu gọi Putin nên tham dự việc đàm phán với Ukraine tại xứ Turkey, khi Tổng thống Ukraine và các nước Âu Châu đều sẵn sàng.

[I] will use leverage on Putin if I have to,&quot; he said.<br>The peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on May 16 ended quickly and with no signs of progress other than a prisoner exchange deal as Ukrainian officials accused Russia of making &quot;unacceptable&quot; demands.<br>The meeting was over about 90 minutes after it began.<br>Negotiators agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners on each side in the near future, the heads of both delegations said. That would be the largest single swap since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.<br>But there was no public indication that the wide gaps between Russia and Ukraine on issues such as territory and a cease-fire were narrowed. European leaders joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in condemning Moscow.<br>&quot;The Russian position is clearly unacceptable, and not for the first time,&quot; British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a joint statement with the leaders of Poland, Germany, and France at a summit in Tirana, Albania.<br>He said that after a meeting with Zelenskyy, who was also at the summit, and a joint phone call with Trump in which they discussed the Istanbul talks, &quot;we are now closely aligning and coordinating our responses and will continue to do so.&quot;<br>&quot;Ukraine is ready to take the fastest possible steps to bring real peace, and it is important that the world holds a strong stance,&quot; Zelenskyy said on social media after the call with Trump.<br>&quot;Our position [is that] if the Russians reject a full and unconditional cease-fire and an end to killings, tough sanctions must follow,&quot; he said. &quot;Pressure on Russia must be maintained until Russia is ready to end the war.&quot;<br>Reuters cited an unnamed Ukrainian source as saying the Russian delegation made demands that were &quot;nonstarters&quot; and were &quot;detached from reality and go far beyond anything that was previously discussed.&quot;<br>The Russian delegation, led by presidential adviser Vladimir Medinsky (center), sits across from Ukrainian officials (not pictured) in Istanbul on May 16.<br>The Russian delegation, led by presidential adviser Vladimir Medinsky (center), sits across from Ukrainian officials (not pictured) in Istanbul on May 16.<br>AFP quoted a Ukrainian source as saying one such demand was &quot;for Ukraine to withdraw forces from large parts of Ukrainian territory it controls in order for a cease-fire to begin.&quot;<br>That was a reference to four regions that Russia partially occupies and baselessly claims are Russian - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson. Ukraine holds parts of those regions, including the capitals of Zaporizhzhya and Kherson.<br>Russian remarks about the meeting contrasted sharply with the criticism.<br>The leader of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin, said Moscow was &quot;satisfied with the result&quot; on the whole and is &quot;ready to continue contacts.&quot; He said his delegation had &quot;taken note&quot; of what he said was a Ukrainian request for talks between Zelenskyy and Putin.<br>Medinsky also said the negotiators agreed that &quot;each side will present its vision of a possible future cease-fire and spell it out in detail. After such a vision has been presented, we believe it would be appropriate, as also agreed, to continue our negotiations.&quot;<br>Expectations for a breakthrough had been low at the first direct peace talks since unsuccessful negotiations held in the first two months of Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion.<br>The May 16 talks capped a frenzied week of diplomacy fueled by Trump&#39;s push to broker an end to the war, which has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides and a growing number of Ukrainian civilians.<br>The Russian and Ukrainian negotiators began their meeting sometime after 1 p.m. local time (noon CET) along with officials from host nation Turkey, and it ended before 3 p.m. (14:00CET) Several separate meetings involving US, Ukrainian, Russian, European, and Turkish officials were also held.<br>Moscow has rejected calls by Ukraine, European nations, and the United States for a full and extendable 30-day cease-fire, saying a truce can only come as the result of negotiations, and Putin spurned Zelenskyy&#39;s invitation to hold their first face-to-face meeting since 2019.<br>The last time Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (left) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) met was in Paris in 2019.<br>Trump Says Meeting With Putin Key To Resolution<br>&quot;This week we had a real chance to take important steps toward ending this war. If only Putin had not been afraid to come to Turkey,&quot; Zelenskyy said in Tirana.<br>Opening the talks in Istanbul, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said it is of &quot;critical importance&quot; to implement a cease-fire &quot;as soon as possible&quot; and &quot;also very important that these talks form the basis of a leaders&#39; meeting. We wholeheartedly believe it is possible to reach peace through constructive negotiations.&quot;<br>Ahead of the talks, the leader of the Ukrainian delegation, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, said on Facebook that peace is possible only if &quot;Russia shows its readiness to take specific actions, including a complete cease-fire for at least 30 days and the implementation of humanitarian measures, such as the return of forcibly deported Ukrainian children,&quot; and the exchange of all prisoners of war.<br>Putin&#39;s decision to send a lower-level delegation to the talks, which he proposed earlier this week and which Trump urged Ukraine to agree to, had dampened already anemic expectations of substantial progress.<br>Trump, who was in the region on a Middle East trip, had hinted he might travel to Turkey to take part if Putin attended. &quot;Nothing&#39;s going to happen until Putin and I get together,&quot; Trump said after the Kremlin announced it was sending a lower-level delegation.<br>After boarding Air Force One in Abu Dhabi on May 16 for the trip back to Washington, Trump said he may call Putin soon. &quot;He and I will meet, and I think we&#39;ll solve it or maybe not,&quot; he said.<br>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, and Ukrainian Head of Presidential Office Andriy Yermak arrive for a meeting at Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul on May 16.<br>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, and Ukrainian Head of Presidential Office Andriy Yermak arrive for a meeting at Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul on May 16.<br>&quot;We&#39;re going to get it done. We got to get it done,&quot; Trump said of ending the war. &quot;Five thousand young people are being killed every single week on average, and we’re going to get it done.&quot;<br>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News on May 15 that there would be no breakthrough unless Trump and Putin sat &quot;across the table&quot; from each other.<br>&quot;I don&#39;t know what the date or the place of that is yet, but that&#39;s really the only chance at this point,&quot; said Rubio, who met with Ukrainian and Turkish officials at Istanbul&#39;s Dolmabahce Palace ahead of the Ukraine-Russia talks at the same venue.<br>Rubio reiterated &quot;the US position that the killing needs to stop,&quot; State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said. Michael Anton, head of policy planning at the State Department, was to meet separately with the Russian delegation.<br>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a Trump-Putin meeting to discuss bilateral ties, Ukraine, and other matters is &quot;certainly necessary&quot; but would take time to prepare and should not be held unless it produces results.<br>Putin launched the full-scale invasion eight years after Russia seized Ukraine&#39;s Crimean Peninsula and fomented war in the eastern Donbas region in 2014. Russia now holds about one-fifth of Ukraine&#39;s territory but has fallen far short of Putin&#39;s goal of subjugating the country, independent since the Soviet collapse in 1991.<br>The only previous direct peace talks broke up in the spring of 2022 as the sides wrangled over major points of contention and amid revelations of atrocities committed by Russian forces in Bucha, a city they abandoned as they withdrew from northern Ukraine after failing to capture Kyiv.<br>Clifford May, founder and president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, says turning away from the world could run counter to Trump&#39;s own goal of preserving US global primacy.<br>In those negotiations, Russia was seeking a deal that analysts said would have amounted to Kyiv&#39;s surrender, leaving Ukraine a permanently neutral country with a small and toothless military, limited sovereignty, and little or no access to Western security support.<br>Russian officials have suggested Moscow has not scaled back its goals despite its failure to seize Kyiv and its slow progress on the battlefield, where small territorial gains have come at a high price in Russian casualties.<br>Some experts say that a cease-fire at the current line of hostilities would be a blow to Putin&#39;s reputation at home but that the Kremlin could be forced to accept it nonetheless if the West ratchets up economic pressure on Russia, including significantly widening sanctions on its oil shipping fleet.<br>Zelenskyy: Russia &#39;Not Serious&#39;<br>The Kremlin has referred to the May 16 talks as the &quot;resumption&quot; of the 2022 negotiations. Medinsky also led the Russian team at those talks. Zelenskyy described the Russian delegation as &quot;decorative&quot; and said its makeup showed &quot;they are not serious enough about the negotiations.&quot;<br>&quot;The Russians want to draw associations with the year 2022,&quot; Zelenskyy&#39;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on May 16. &quot;But the only thing that connects to those negotiations is the city of Istanbul.

Moody’s lowered the US credit score to Aa1 from Aaa, joining Fitch Ratings and S&amp;P Global Ratings in grading the world’s biggest economy below the top, triple-A position.<br>The one-notch cut comes more than a year after Moody’s changed its outlook on the US rating to negative. The federal budget deficit is running near $2 trillion a year, or more than 6% of gross domestic product, and Congressional Republicans are pushing through budget legislation that could add trillions of dollars more. “While we recognize the US’ significant economic and financial strengths, we believe these no longer fully counterbalance the decline in fiscal metrics,” Moody’s wrote in a statement.<br>U.S. Consumer Sentiment Falls to Near Record Low<br>Short- and long-term inflation expectations hit multi-decade high<br>Source: University of Michigan<br>Earlier today, new data showed US consumer sentiment has fallen to the second-lowest level on record, and inflation expectations climbed to multi-decade highs. The preliminary May sentiment index declined to 50.8 from 52.2 a month earlier, according to the University of Michigan. That was lower than all but one estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The main reason cited was President Donald Trump’s trade war.<br>Nearly three-fourths of respondents to the Michigan survey spontaneously mentioned tariffs. The topic crosses partisan lines, including a notable share of Republicans bringing it up. The new, sobering survey data comes as inflation data from the Trump administration’s Department of Labor has been unexpectedly upbeat, coming in softer than estimates three months in a row.<br>A key House committee on Friday failed to advance House Republicans’ massive tax-and-spending bill after hard-right Republicans demanded even deeper cuts to healthcare for the poor and disabled. Proposed cuts in Medicaid would be used in part to renew 2017 GOP tax cuts that largely benefitted the wealthy and corporations and fulfill populist campaign promises by Trump to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime.<br>It’s incredibly rare for bills to fail at this step in the process, with the committee vote typically serving as a rubber-stamp to the bill before it moves to the House floor. But the Republicans are caught in a bind. With razor-thin majorities in either chamber, they can’t pull too much further to the right lest members in high-tax blue states bolt. With midterms next year, they are looking to raise the cap their own party imposed on state and local tax deductions during Trump’s first term.<br>China shrank its holdings of US Treasuries in March, with the UK replacing it as the No. 2 overseas owner. China was the top holder of Treasuries as recently as 2019, when Japan overtook it. Total overseas holdings of the debt rose $233.1 billion, to $9.05 trillion, Treasury Department figures showed Friday. While the release showed there was no revolt against American government securities in the first few months of the Trump administration, the data predates the destabilization of the US Treasuries market last month following Trump’s rollout of “reciprocal” tariffs.<br>Foreign Holdings of US Treasuries<br>China was surpassed by Japan as the top foreign owner in 2019, and has now slipped behind the UK<br>Source: Treasury Department<br>Stocks rose Friday as the Financial Times reported the US and the European Union broke an impasse to enable tariff talks, bolstering optimism about negotiations with America’s top trade partners. The news comes after the Trump administration announced an agreement with the UK and a temporary truce with China in the trade war. The renewed optimism sent the S&amp;P 500 up 0.7% Friday, with the gauge climbing over 5% for the week. Action in the bond market was muted, though Treasuries saw a third straight weekly drop - the longest slide this year.

The infamous April 2 “Liberation Day” announcements necessitated obvious treatment, and I feel the Dividend Cafe did well in the tumult of that period.  I am not sure I thought I would ever write a Dividend Cafe about the psychological motivations of an elected President when I began writing a weekly market commentary in September of 2008, but I suppose I would rather write about that than what I was writing about in September of 2008 (oh how quickly we forget what real drama feels like).  The tariff issue (with the tax bill issue behind it) has been the dominant story in markets since March, and with the “left tail risk” issue so clearly muted in light of the reclaiming of the “Trump market put,” not to mention the reversal on Chinese tariffs, I get at least one week off from those “ripped from the headline” topics.  There is still plenty to assess about the U.S. economy in the weeks and months ahead, and the Dividend Cafe will strive to be the most reliable place you can find for that assessment (I am sad to say, that is a low bar).<br>But today we won’t say the word “tariff” again, there will be no talk about the President or various policies (though on Monday there will be a lot of that!), and we won’t bounce around to a variety of market stories.  I am doing my favorite thing in writing the Dividend Cafe today – picking one topic, and writing to my heart’s content about it.<br>Today’s topic was inspired by the recent announcement of the 94-year-old, Warren Buffett, that he will retire as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year.  Worth over $150 billion, Warren Buffett is generally considered to be one of the greatest investors of all time.  And like all things that contain such superlative assessment, there is a wide dispersion of opinions behind it.  I have some opinions of my own, and those opinions will be the topic of today’s Dividend Cafe.  My purpose is actually to be very practical.  I don’t think there is a lot of benefit to me saying “he evaluated this well” or “his process of value investing around discounts to intrinsic value was very good” …  If his compound annual growth rate and also that, you know, $156 BILLION NET WORTH FIGURE didn’t validate those things, I am not sure what will.<br>Today, we are looking at a practical breakdown of what made Buffett, Buffett.  There are a couple of thoughts here that may surprise you, but I believe are vital to understanding his legacy.  And understanding his legacy can only make us all better investors.  Did I mention the $156 billion figure?<br>Let’s jump on in to the Dividend Cafe.<br>With regards,<br>David L. Bahnsen<br>Chief Investment Officer, Managing Partner<br>NGUYÊN VĂN LÁ THƯ HÔM NAY CỦA DAVID BAHNSEN:<br>Hello and welcome to the Dividend Cafe. <br>My name&#39;s David Bahnsen. I&#39;m the managing partner at the Bahnsen Group, and I have the distinct privilege of doing the Dividend Cafe every single Friday to come to you and talk about some particular investment or market principle, commentary, opinion lesson, et cetera, and I&#39;m very excited for today because I do believe it is the first time in about eight weeks where I got to sit down this morning and write about what I wanted to write about, and not by just market necessity and conditions of what&#39;s happening in the broader economy and the world around us. I didn&#39;t have to talk this week about the trade war, the market turbulence that has resulted from the tariff drama that has been going on now since, mid to late March and that really hit its apex in early April.  And as you go back over the last seven, eight weeks, in a Friday Dividend Cafe, there&#39;s been a lot of discussion about what President Trump is doing and not doing, and where the trade war is and has moved and on again, off again. <br>This week&#39;s Dividend Cafe is going to just simply be a particular topic that I wanna write about that isn&#39;t gonna touch President Trump. Tariffs trade, even the pending tax bill. I believe a lot of those things are coming back in our fray on Monday. <br>Every Monday I&#39;m trying to cover what&#39;s going on in the economy, the Fed public policy markets, housing, energy, all of these different topics, and there are things going on right now as I&#39;m talking that will probably be more resolved over the weekend. So perfect fodder for the Monday Dividend Cafe about the big, beautiful tax bill, but it&#39;s a moving target itself right now. So I&#39;m really glad to not be writing about that today and risk having the Dividend Cafe be obsolete by the time it got to you. [Quái!] So I&#39;m wanna talk today about Warren Buffett. <br>And this is not something I&#39;ve really, I don&#39;t think ever talked about in the Dividend Cafe. I&#39;ve been a student of Buffett&#39;s both his history his investment methodology and philosophy. Even before Buffett, I had read a lot of Ben Graham as a younger man, and Benjamin Graham himself was Warren Buffett&#39;s boss at his second job as a young adult and his mentor in value investing. <br>And so there, there is an element to this that&#39;s been very interesting and important to me professionally for a very long time. But that&#39;s not exactly the theme I want to get into today. To go write a Dividend Cafe about intrinsic value investing, which is what Graham and then Buffet made famous, I think it would be a little redundant and unhelpful. For one thing, we&#39;re dividend growth investors at our firm for another. There the idea of what they do essentially as a methodology that Graham codified, nearly a hundred years ago of discounting cash flows the future, and finding companies trading at a discount to what that intrinsic discounted value is. I think that there&#39;s no question that Buffet was just extraordinarily good at it, but the methodology itself may not be very interesting to you. <br>And I believe I found a topic that I think is very important out of the life and legacy and success of Warren Buffet. So I want, the reason now it&#39;s been catalyzed into the Dividend Cafe is he announced his pending retirement at the recent annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting in Omaha. Our own senior equity analyst Liping goes to that conference every year and was there to hear the announcement. <br>But let&#39;s be real, he&#39;s 94 years old. The markets have known for a very long time that Mr. Buffet would at some point, for whatever reason, not be the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway forever. But nevertheless, it&#39;s a newsworthy event. This is a remarkable person&#39;s story, history and investor success. And so I think it&#39;s an interesting topic for us here in the Dividend Cafe as to what may be. A couple of these takeaways are, but see, some of them are so are redundant, or at least I should say, not very profound. In other words, it&#39;s information you could get elsewhere. I&#39;m gonna go through a few of those and conclude with my kind of bottom line today, which I believe is a unique perspective on Buffet. That is then really not that much about Buffett and something that I think might be helpful for all of us. <br>For everyone who&#39;s an investor, for everyone who&#39;s a business leader, for everyone who is an entrepreneur, for everyone who works in an organization, there&#39;s some kind of evergreen takeaway here in Buffet that I think is worth noting, and that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do today in the Dividend Cafe, the easier ones. <br>First, you know that Warren Buffett was only worth $370 million when he was 52 years old. And he&#39;s now 94. Okay, so he&#39;s now worth $150 billion. And people could say, I&#39;m not sure that it really matters because how am I gonna accumulate $370 million by age 52? That&#39;s certainly true. It&#39;s difficult to do. But let me really make the point that is applicable with a thousand dollars, let alone the 370. I guarantee you that when you hear 370 million went to 150 billion, you&#39;re thinking of a number bigger than 15%. In fact, you might even be thinking of a number of 39000%, I think it&#39;s 38,900 to be precise because that is the return that the percentage from 370 million, 150 billion, 38900%, but no, it&#39;s 15% per year. It&#39;s just simply a story of math. The math that comes from time. That comes from what we call compounding that people talk about all the time, that most people have a very hard time recognizing. [Ta gọi là… lãi kép!] It&#39;s why. <br>There are people that will tell me, I paid X for my house. I&#39;ve lived there 30 years, and can you believe it? It&#39;s now worth y and it&#39;s a small number at X and a big number at Y. And I go, that&#39;s amazing. And I go, by the way, did you know that&#39;s 4.5% per year or 6.9% per year? Because the percentage return, what we call a CAGR, a compound annual growth rate ends up being a lot lower over greater time, which is another way of saying that time helps create a higher total return. And in Buffet&#39;s case, but from age 50 to 90, essentially to round down a little bit 15% is a big number to compound that. But when you go from a few hundred million to $150 billion and you&#39;ve as a percentage gone up that much, there&#39;s just a simple lesson in the gift of longevity. <br>One of the greatest things Warren Buffet did that was worth tens of billions of dollars to him with stay alive in his eighties and nineties. Okay now. How do you get 370 million by age 50 for him? He started off as a very young man working at his dad&#39;s stock brokerage firm, and he did very well. Principle one of compounding in time does also beg the question of principle two, which is fundamentals. <br>The man earned well and the man saved well, and he invested well, and then that allowed the compounding. And he had a million bucks by age 30. Now that&#39;s a lot of money. In 1955 or whatever the age was, by 1965, he was able to go become the lead shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway and used that as a perch from which he would obviously go into hypergrowth of his own business empire. But my point is he was blocking and tackling and he was a smart and very hardworking guy to do so with. But there isn&#39;t anything super sensationalistic. There&#39;s no dot com overnight, Bitcoin overnight, just YouTube influencer nonsensical absurdity story here. This is the blocking and tackling of fundamental wealth accumulation that then puts you in a position to accumulate. <br>But he did so with a great deal of talent. I don&#39;t wanna act like this was simple, but it was very fundamental. It was work hard, earn, save, invest, and then eventually seeing that number. There&#39;s a chart@dividendcafe.com that shows that growth over time. But I think most people are aware if they think through it, of the benefit of compounding, the benefit of being 94, and then the compounding of by working and saving early on and all those things.<br>At some point in Buffett&#39;s life, this has been talked about a lot. So again, this is also not anything new or profound. He also benefited from a benefit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. There was a self-reinforcing mechanism that Buffett got a premium in his return by being the person who owned the asset, that there was a size, a scale, but also a credibility and authority that by him owning it, it was worth more. And so he owned it &#39;cause it thought it had value and then it had value because he owned it. And then there was a value creation process within it. <br>But I don&#39;t wanna ignore the just self-fulfilling nature, I think all of us are capable of time value and compounding by avoiding the interruption of compounding. I think all of us are capable of fundamentals. Not all of us are capable of the self-fulfilling reality of things get more valuable just because you own them. So let&#39;s put that on the table there. And then the fourth thing before I get to my real, grand finale here is a hobby horse of mine. And yet I think a good opportunity. <br>To make the point that Warren Buffet was a voracious reader, and you go, come on you&#39;re saying he read a lot of books and became worth $150 billion. I know. A librarian in my town who isn&#39;t worth 30 grand and that person reads all the time. No, I&#39;m saying that reading is a necessary but not sufficient condition of elite. Knowledge accumulation applied to elite compounding of capital. In other words, the general Mattis had a quote about someone who has not read, hundreds of books as functionally illiterate. And I agree with General Mattis, that there is a lost art of accumulation and knowledge that comes from working the muscle, which is called the brain. [Wow!] <br>That processes information. Yes, it does take in information. It takes in data and starts a process of analysis. But then what it does is it exercises the muscle to make you better at analysis, better at processing, better at gathering, better at application and reading history, reading biography, reading philosophy, reading, economics, reading. Buffett&#39;s case, a massive amount of business history, but also corporate reports. The, your typical 10 Qs, 10 Ks, a lot of the analysis that stock research people like us do. But he just read voraciously and I am coming across people on a daily basis that I think are dramatically limited by the fact that they&#39;re not readers. <br>Part of it is the modern technology that people are. Their brain is outta shape for reading because they&#39;re so accustomed to video snippets, reels, scrolling, even social media, which is bite sized. But that, but look, I don&#39;t want to be in my day. We read books throughout all the human history. People read books and then got smarter. And I think that there&#39;s a lot of benefit in the great books, and I think it&#39;s a sad case of higher education. The great books of Western civilization are not promoted the way they are for one&#39;s intellectual journey. And I don&#39;t mean this just simply in the way I would talk to high school students about important. It is they be great readers. I mean it in the case of Warren Buffet, that it helped make him worth $150 billion and that there are a lot of corporate CEOs that are not readers and it limits them. Now they can be gifted in other things and they could overcome it, but it&#39;s a handicap to not be a reader. That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying. <br>And Warren Buffet, I think was a voracious reader. All right, so the time value compounding, the discipline and fundamentals, the self-fulfilment prophecy of buffet being buffet, and then yes, just, the benefit of reading, but it still leads me to what I think is a little bit more contrarian of an observation that I want to conclude with that is the heart of Dividend Cafe today, which is the absolutely unbelievable successful. Use appreciation of awareness of application of social capital relationship building, harnessing human beings in Warren Buffett&#39;s journey. You can say all you want, that he read corporate reports better than others, but to fail to recognize the way in which he tapped into a vast array of resources. The way to fail to recognize that is what all business organizational entrepreneurial success often comes down to is compounding from the benefits out of these additional relationships, networks, resources, connections. <br>There is an array of talent that nobody, no matter how bright they are, no matter how bright Warren Buffet is, can know all things. The leverage we get out of a diversity of relationships because of different people having diverse skills, people having diverse subject matter expertise, diversity of geography. Warren Buffett was based in Omaha, Nebraska, and Omaha Nebraska is not the financial capital of America, but he was very well networked in New York City. <br>He was very well networked in Silicon Valley. He was very well networked in Los Angeles, Southern California, in oil area and in insurance industry. And so there&#39;s geographical. Sector diversification that still does not come down to reading in a book or knowing just something about a particular company. The way in which this guy who clearly is far more extroverted than I am, I&#39;m a deeply introverted person, but I really recognize the benefits of how he put together salons, discussion groups, symposiums, they travel together and look not. Everybody is gonna get a private plane together and put eight muckety mucks on it and go to Bermuda for a weekend to talk about world peace or an economic challenge or whatever the case may be. <br>My point: he leveraged resources to do it in style. I&#39;m sure do it at a more elite level, but that&#39;s not really my point. My point is the basic connectivity. Human beings because of human action being the fundamental reality of economics, that economics being the study of human action, it starts with this diversity of human skill, ingenuity. <br>God created talent and giftedness that exists, and Buffet&#39;s ability to tap into it in a very profound way and building out over time organic. And doing this very non cynically, it was not transactional, but investing into the relationships and what not, that over time built a human resource network for him that became very rothers drama of the 1990s. And in him being the person that folks would tap into when there was need for desperate capital with Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, General Electric, out of the financial crisis. <br>There, there just there&#39;s an obvious sense in which Buffett was able to do this in a way. Most people are not, but there&#39;s also a less obvious sense in which the exact same principle. Is a hundred percent true for everybody as an investor, as a leader, as a business entrepreneur the relationships that we build and the investment that we put into these networks, social networks that leverage the giftedness of other humans. The connectivity and resources, these things compound over time the same way the information compounds over time that a reader like buffet can take in and the same way the capital compounds over time because of math. This is essentially a lesson of compounding, and Buffett was able to do it in a profound way, and I think that investment in these relationships is a wonderful lesson. For us to take in and understanding the ultimate legacy of Warren Buffett. <br>By the way, as I wrap this up, no need to send me emails on things. We don&#39;t like about Warren Buffett. That isn&#39;t my point. There&#39;s a lot of things I disagree with Warren Buffett personally and even investment wise. There&#39;s a lot of things I&#39;ve learned from him about it. That&#39;s true of all people. <br>But I am here today only to talk about those five things I just brought up. The fact that there&#39;s other things out there that people may like or dislike, is what he said about a tax policy here, a political thing here, other issue there. I&#39;m aware of those things already. I just wanna stick to the matter at hand. There&#39;s a lot to be learned in these things we talked about with Buffett [1] the longevity time value compounding, [2] the discipline fundamentals, [3] his self-fulfilling prophecy benefit, [4] the really evergreen benefit of being a voracious reader. And then finally [5] that true revelation and application about human capital, human connections, and investing in relationships that compound over time, <br>I believe not only makes one a better business success and yeah, in his case, made &#39;em worth the 150 billion. I would argue it makes for more fulfilling lives for all of us. Thank you as always for listening. <br>And watching and reading the Dividend Cafe. I hope you have a wonderful weekend. I look forward to seeing you Monday, where we get to get back to public policy, tax tariffs, Trump and all the things. In the meantime, have a wonderful weekend and let&#39;s go Knicks. </div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R53" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">54</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/16/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:4144px;left:-1px">SHARYL ATTKISSON KHÔNG HỀ BIẾT SỢ!<br>Hôm nay, Sharyl mở ra một hồ sơ sẽ làm nhiều người không muốn đọc vì quá rắc rối.

Kinh hãi!<br>https://sharylattkisson.com/.../read-judicial-watch.../<br>Judicial Watch exposes Biden team pressure on Special Counsel Hur<br>By Sharyl Attkisson | May 16, 2025<br>The following is from Judicial Watch.<br>Judicial Watch announced it received from the US Department of Justice in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit 49 pages of records detailing pressure asserted by Biden White House and Joe Biden’s personal lawyers on Special Counsel Robert Hur regarding the October 2023 interviews of then-President Biden in the criminal investigation into his theft, retention, and disclosure of classified records. Non-disclosure agreements signed by the president’s lawyers are also included in the records.<br>Judicial Watch filed a July 2024 FOIA lawsuit against the Department of Justice for all communications about the Hur report with the Office of the White House Counsel and Biden’s personal lawyers (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:24-cv-02179)).<br>Judicial Watch has several ongoing FOIA lawsuits about Biden’s document scandals and the related unprecedented partisan prosecutorial and judicial abuses of former President Donald J. Trump.<br>In April 2025, Judicial Watch uncovered Justice Department records showing White House staffers suggesting edits to transcripts of President Biden’s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur regarding his handling of secret documents.<br>In February 2025, a federal court ordered the Department of Justice to declare whether it intends to continue denying Judicial Watch’s request for the full audio of former President Joe Biden’s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. The Trump Justice Department has until May 20, 2025, to report its position on the release of the videotape.<br>In June 2024, the Biden administration was forced to admit that the transcripts of audio recordings of Biden’s interviews with Special Counsel Hur had been altered and are not accurate.<br>The new records include an October 18, 2023, letter, just a few days after Hur’s interviews of Biden, from Special Counsel to the President Richard Sauber and Biden’s personal attorney Bob Bauer to Hur. They express concerns about the release of the report:<br>    &quot;At our meeting last Friday, we requested that you provide an overview of where matters stand in this case, particularly any remaining questions or concerns we should address. We also asked for the opportunity to discuss your expected report to the Attorney General at the conclusion of the investigation, including time to review it prior to its submission to the Attorney General. You advised us that you were not prepared to engage with these requests at that time but would take them under consideration.<br>    &quot;Moreover, to the extent that your report touches in any way upon procedures in this or prior administrations for the handling of sensitive national security information, your report will also be read with intense interest in every foreign capital. It could affect the national security interests of the United States in ways that none of us can anticipate.<br>An October 31, 2023, email from Sauber to the Special Counsel’s Office documents the repeated efforts by the Biden legal team to review the report before its release. The letter states:<br>   &quot;In our October 18 letter to you, we asked to have the opportunity to review and comment on a draft of the “confidential” report that you are required to write under the Special Counsel regulations. We also noted that we would follow up on the subject of the Special Counsel’s “final report” requirement more broadly.<br>    &quot;At a minimum, the report should adhere to the kind of product contemplated by the Special Counsel regulations. As discussed, in contrast to the detailed independent counsel reports setting forth a “full and complete” description of their work, the Special Counsel regulations contemplate only that the Special Counsel will “explain[] the prosecution or declination decisions.” … We support your faithful fulfillment of this requirement. But, consistent with the Department’s description of a “limited” and “summary” product, … , the report should be economical. It should include the factual information necessary to the charging decision, but facts or events that are not essential to the decision have no place….<br>In a December 15, 2023,  2023, letter Sauber and Bauer reiterate the request and also ask for access to the classification review of the materials found and the return of the records of a personal nature to Biden.<br>In a January 3, 2024, letter Sauber and Bauer again reiterate the request for a pre-release review and express concern that the final report provide an “appropriate public presentation” of the facts of the case.<br>On January 5, 2024, “RKHSC,” (Robert K. Hur, special counsel) sends an email to Bauer and others discussing “nondisclosure agreement and certification.” The non-disclosure agreement and certification state:<br>NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT<br>    &quot;This agreement applies to the review by members of the White House Counsel’s Office and personal counsel of the report of the Special Counsel’s Office.<br>    Review will be limited to the following people: Ed Siskel (White House Counsel), Richard Sauber (Special Counsel to the President), Rachel Cotton (Senior Counsel to the President), Robert Bauer (personal counsel), and Jennifer Miller (personal counsel). This agreement refers to this group collectively as “counsel.”<br>CERTIFICATION<br>By this certification, I affirm to the Department of Justice that I have and will continue to adhere to the terms of the attached non-disclosure agreement …<br>I understand that Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, makes it a felony to knowingly and willfully make a materially false statement in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States.<br>On January 9, Bauer emails his and Jennifer Miller’s non-disclosure agreements and certifications to Hur and others.<br>In a February 5, 2024, letter to Hur, Sauber and Bauer outline their complaints about the draft report. The first concern they raise is the report’s characterization of Biden’s failing memory:<br>    &quot;We do not believe that the report’s treatment of President Biden’s memory is accurate or appropriate. The report uses highly prejudicial language to describe a commonplace occurrence among witnesses: a lack of recall of years-old events. Such comments have no place in a Department of Justice report, particularly one that in the first paragraph announces that no criminal charges are “warranted” and that “the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden’s guilt.” If the evidence does not establish guilt, then discussing the jury impact of President Biden’s hypothetical testimony at a trial that will never occur is entirely superfluous.<br>    “We are pleased to hear that the Trump Justice Department plans to release the Biden audio tapes in response to Judicial Watch’s FOIA lawsuit,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “These new records further show how desperate the Biden gang was to hide the full truth about Biden’s failing memory – and criminality.”<br>In the February 5, 2024, “Report of the Special Counsel on the Investigation Into Unauthorized Removal, Retention, and Disclosure of Classified Documents Discovered at Locations Including the Penn Biden Center and the Delaware Private Residence of President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.” Hur called Biden a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” and declined to charge Biden with a “serious felony:”<br>    We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory. Based on our direct interactions with and observations of him, he is someone for whom many jurors will want to identify reasonable doubt. It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him - by then a former president well into his eighties - of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.<br>Prior to the finalization of the report, the White House issued a letter to the Special Counsel’s office attacking the report’s “treatment of President Biden’s memory,” and added “there is ample evidence from your interview that the President did well in answering your questions …”<br>Read the full press release here.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R54" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">55</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/16/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2857px;left:-1px">MỘT NGƯỜI DA ĐEN NÓI THẬT…<br>VÀ LẬT MẶT NẠ BỌN DA ĐEN LÀM BỘ ĂN VẠ! <br>Trên The Spectator, một độc giả da đen viết về bọn dân cử da đen làm bộ đòi bồi thường thiệt hại cho dân nô lệ da đen thuở xa xưa tại Mỹ nhằm hốt phiếu cử tri da đen bằng… một ngàn tỷ tiền thuế của thiên hạ. <br>Quá dễ hiểu mà ít ai thấy ra hiện tượng đấm mõm ăn vạ!<br>https://thespectator.com/.../democrats-trillion-dollar.../<br>The Democrats’ trillion-dollar reparations racket<br>I couldn’t take a check in good conscience<br>(David Sypher Jr. - The Spectator - Friday, May 16, 2025)<br>Reparations<br>Rep. Summer Lee (D-PA) (Getty)<br>When politicians run out of solutions, they start offering symbolism – and this year, that symbolism comes in the form of a check.<br>Representative Summer Lee’s “Reparations Now” resolution calls for trillions of dollars in payments to black Americans as compensation for slavery and its aftershocks. As a black man in America, this issue cuts close to home. My grandparents came from South Georgia, and their grandparents were born into slavery. That blood runs through me. The pain, the endurance, the quiet strength – it’s part of my inheritance.<br>If reparations were handed out, I’d be one of the people eligible to receive them. But I couldn’t take the check in good conscience.<br>Because while I honor what my ancestors endured, I don’t believe their suffering should be reduced to a dollar amount. They didn’t survive for me to wait on a payout – they fought, worked and built so I could stand on my own. To accept that check would feel like trading in their dignity for dependency. My success – and even my setbacks – are mine. And that’s something they would’ve wanted: not a government handout, but a legacy of strength.<br>This isn’t just about money – it’s about narrative. And the story being told here is that black Americans remain helpless without government intervention, that our future is forever chained to our past. That’s not empowerment. It’s political theater.<br>The reality is that this narrative doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. The strongest predictors of success in today’s America are not race or historical trauma – but family structure, socioeconomic stability and cultural habits. This is not to deny the horrors of slavery or the devastation of Jim Crow. It’s to say that we are not defined by them.<br>A two-parent household is one of the greatest protectors against poverty, incarceration and poor educational outcomes – regardless of race. Strong families and disciplined values beat government checks every time. That’s the reality politicians like Summer Lee refuse to acknowledge because it doesn’t fuel their outrage machine or their fundraising campaigns.<br>If she truly wanted to uplift black America, she wouldn’t be demanding trillion-dollar reparations. She’d be pushing for school choice. She’d be fighting for small-business deregulation and access to capital. She’d be demanding that the welfare state stop punishing marriage and fatherhood in low-income communities. In other words, she’d be doing the hard, thankless work of restoring the cultural and economic foundations that make progress sustainable – not symbolic.<br>But instead, we get this: a flashy, impossible promise with no legislative future. Reparations have become the crypto of progressive politics – all hype, no stability and an easy way to get people emotionally invested in something that will never pay out.<br>Lee went even further, framing this as a historical inflection point: “This is a moment in time where societies are shaped and new societies are built. We should be the ones who are shaping it.”<br>It’s a stirring line, designed to evoke empowerment. But let’s not kid ourselves – it’s also fear-based messaging. It implies that unless we cash in now, black Americans will be locked out of whatever “new society” is coming. That unless trillions are handed down from Washington, the future will be forged without us.<br>That’s not just misleading – it’s disempowering.<br>There is no grand conspiracy to erase black people from the future. But there is a very real danger in telling generations of young black men and women that their fate depends on what politicians in DC decide, instead of the choices they make every single day. It’s the soft bigotry of low expectations – wrapped in the language of racial justice.<br>And here’s the real insult: the very government that oversaw slavery, enforced segregation and mismanaged public housing is now supposed to be the moral and economic savior of black America? The same system that failed us for generations is now being sold as our only hope? That’s not justice – it’s delusion.<br>And yet, every few years, right on schedule, the reparations debate gets revived – not because it’s politically viable, but because it’s politically useful. It galvanizes the base. It dominates the headlines. It keeps black Americans emotionally tethered to a party that has perfected the art of symbolic politics.<br>But what has that party delivered? Urban schools still fail. Black-owned businesses still struggle to access capital. The welfare state continues to discourage marriage and reward dependence. And violent crime is disproportionately concentrated in black neighborhoods run by the same leaders who claim to be our advocates.<br>This is the bait-and-switch of modern racial politics: trade in real empowerment for political theater. Promise trillions you can’t deliver while doing nothing to fix the structures that actually keep black communities stagnant. It’s not progress – it’s a trap.<br>What black America needs isn’t more apologies or empty resolutions. It needs a cultural restoration – one that prioritizes family, ownership, faith, discipline and education. We don’t need another round of grievance politics. We need to build.<br>That’s the real path to power. Not symbolic checks, but generational wealth. Not victimhood narratives, but legacy thinking. Not state-funded absolution, but community-led transformation.<br>If there’s a new society being built, we don’t need reparations to shape it. We need responsibility, resolve, and reality-based leadership. Because the future isn’t handed out – it’s earned.<br>And the people best positioned to lead black America forward aren’t those who exploit our pain for press conferences. They’re the ones building families, businesses and institutions despite the noise – quietly proving every day that we don’t need to be saved. We just need to be free.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R55" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">56</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/16/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:1857px;left:-1px">ĐỪNG LAY TÔI NHÉ, CUỘC ĐỜI!<br>Vừa mừng là hôm nay Thứ Sáu thấy Nellie Bowles chọc quê thiên hạ trên The Free Press thì mình lại bị cuộc đời lay động: <br>Thiên hạ tại Hoa Kỳ bị quê thật vì bao người ngợi ca thương chiến biết lùi của Trump thì niềm tin của giới tiêu thụ lại... lùi xuống dốc! <br>Từ 57% vào Tháng Ba, niềm tin tuột xuống 52,2% vào Tháng Tư và số sơ khởi cho Tháng Năm chỉ còn 50,8% - vì e sợ lạm phát.

And much more.<br>(By Nellie Bowles - The Free Press - 05.16.25 - TGIF)<br>Produced by ElevenLabs using AI narration<br>Welcome back to your trusted week in review, written this week from the middle seat on my way to San Francisco for a Free Press debate. Our first flight was canceled after we sat in the plane for many hours, and I’ve slept very little, so I am ready for war. This week is a short one because of that, plus I have to prepare for the big event (attending the debate after-party, and wondering why my pinot noir is taking this long).<br>→ What kind of refugees wear cargo shorts: The Trump administration made good on its promise to allow certain white South Africans to claim refugee status in America. This week 59 Afrikaners (descendants of the mostly Dutch colonists who began settling in South Africa in the seventeenth century, also known as Boers) arrived on our pearly shores, hungry for biltong, ready to crack open a hard cider for a sundowner after the braai. Imagine explaining the Triple Dipper at Chili’s to these people. Everyone is being weird about their arrival, except, surprisingly, the Afrikaners. First, the Trump administration. Here’s what the deputy secretary of state said when welcoming the lucky 59: “When you have quality seeds, you can put them in foreign soil and they will blossom.” Quality seeds. He means genes, strong white Dutch seeds to be exact. The Danes and the Dutch are major sperm exporters, and so this week the Trump administration, yet again, agrees with America’s lesbians. Personally, I feel that blondes are fundamentally inbred, but to each her own, Mr. President.<br>Anyway, the Afrikaners really are fleeing persecution, and those denying it probably on some level think they deserve it - a little ancestral blood justice. But the farm murders are truly not a hoax, and a popular South African political leader named Julius Malema really does gather together huge crowds to chant things like: “Shoot to kill. Kill the Boer.”<br>Or as The New York Times has explained it: “Right-wing commenters claim that an old anti-apartheid chant is a call to anti-white violence, but historians and the left-wing politician who embraces it say it should not be taken literally.” It’s a metaphor, silly goose.<br>The African National Congress, South Africa’s governing party, is furious that Afrikaners are calling for help and gaining sympathy among the American right: “What the instigators of this falsehood seek is not safety, but impunity from transformation. They flee not from persecution, but from justice, equality, and accountability for historic privilege.” Impunity from transformation. Accountability for historic privilege. I can’t believe only 59 have left! My favorite part is that at the bottom of the ANC letter is a contact for media inquiries. Reach out to: Mangaliso “Stalin” Khonza, National Communications Manager. Indeed, his nom de communications guerre is Stalin. Pray tell, Stalin: What does transformation look like here?<br>MSNBC agrees with the idea that the Afrikaners must stay in South Africa and learn accountability. Here was a panelist named Rick Stengel: “These are the descendants of the people who created the most diabolical system of white supremacy in human history,” and “There’s just been a small handful of farmers that have been killed. . . it’s just a farce and a sham.” (It’s more than a handful.) So it’s evil that their ancestors went there, and also evil for their descendants ever to leave. Tricky puzzle, this one.<br>Then comes the Episcopal Church, which has been helping resettle refugees for decades but said they would not help the Afrikaners, and will instead entirely end their resettlement partnership with the U.S. government over it. “In light of our church’s steadfast commitment to racial justice and reconciliation and our historic ties with the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, we are not able to take this step.”<br>Two things can be true at once (and yes, I should get this phrase tattooed on my person): The Trump administration can embrace a more eugenic immigration philosophy genuinely at odds with Episcopalian beliefs (all souls being equal and such) and the Afrikaners can be legitimate refugees who are in danger. We’ve grown so accustomed to refugee applying only to “young men seeking economic opportunity” that we forgot that not all refugees are ambitious 23-year-old Moroccans looking to enjoy the greatness of capitalism! Me, I’m balanced: pro-immigration but neither racist nor anti-racist. I don’t care if you’re a Dutchman or a Moroccan. I just believe our border entry should be determined by a combination IQ and physical fitness test, a quick grade on baby-rocking ability, see how long it takes you to down a Triple Dipper, then Jordan Peterson personally deciding if you’re too neurotic, and boom - welcome to America. Here’s your Amazon warehouse tunic. Lekker? Lekker.<br>→ The new Statue of Liberty: Donald Trump is being gifted a jumbo jet by the Qataris. The administration says it’s being given to the Defense Department and then will go to Trump’s “presidential library foundation,” which I’m sure will be very real and very full of big books. Facing criticism, Trump reposted someone on Truth Social saying the plane is a gift from a foreign government, like the Statue of Liberty was a gift from France. Just like that. But does the Statue of Liberty have a minibar full of Diet Coke? [Quái chiêu!]<br>My favorite exchange on this whole thing was on Fox News, between Brian Kilmeade and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.<br>    Kilmeade: “Do you worry that if [the Qataris] give us something like this, they want something in return?”<br>    Leavitt: “Absolutely not, because they know President Trump, and they know he only works with the interests of the American public in mind.”<br>To be clear, I only work with the interests of TGIF in mind. So if someone wants to gift a briefcase of diamonds or a big private plane, TGIF might be interested in promoting your concrete company. Incentives: aligned! You’re welcome, TG readers. [Quái chiêu!]<br>Attesting to the legality of the gift from Qatar was United States attorney general and top blonde Pam Bondi, whose former job was working as a lobbyist for Qatar. [Nhắc nhở là đúng!]<br>→ Egg prices improving, which is bad, part of a fiction:<br>There is so much legitimately bad stuff the White House is doing day in and day out. A small, Chinese-linked company is investing $300 million into $TRUMP coin this week, to do more corruption right before our eyes. The jet! Don Jr.’s Executive Branch club! But CNN couldn’t let Trumpo have this one little win?<br>I guess grocery prices going up is a major narrative, so it must be stuck to. After the mainstream spent four years downplaying grocery inflation, NBC News announced this week that their new, always-on data journalism effort will track Trump-flation: “NBC News is tracking changes in the prices of eggs, bread, ground beef, chicken, and other grocery items to monitor the impact on consumers’ food bills.” I hope the vacation was gorgeous, guys. Great to have you back.<br>→ Recession is called off: JPMorgan has dropped its recession prediction, and now declares the U.S. economy is growing and everything is probably fine. And to think that two weeks ago, I was cutting up my books to hide gold in them. I myself can’t believe it, but Trump’s tariff gambit seems to have worked: China is reducing tariffs on U.S. goods to something like where they were before (from 125 percent back to 10 percent). And the U.S. will then drop our new 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods to a more humane, but still hefty, 30 percent. It worked? And nothing that bad happened along the way. Trump’s approval rating is even clicking up. I guess I was... sorry, I’m gagging a little... I guess I was wrong. Art of the... Lord, give me strength... deal.<br>→ Biden and Kamala continue their bickering: A top adviser to Kamala’s presidential run told authors of a forthcoming book that Biden screwed the campaign over, and that if he had only dropped out earlier, Kamala would have soared. Which makes no sense, because she became slightly less popular as she campaigned. It seems like if Biden would’ve quit just a couple months earlier, Doug Emhoff might have been in the East Wing today switching out the drapes and getting ready for SoulCycle in Georgetown. The new book details Biden’s aging, and the lengths people went to cover it up includes that his team planned for Biden to be in a wheelchair soon after the election. I need everyone involved in this to step away from public life. But they refuse. Last week, Joe and Dr. Jill Biden went on The View. The ladies asked him about the criticisms of his age, and he went on for a few minutes until Dr. Jill, our villain, swooped in to say how very hard he worked.<br>    The people who wrote those books were not in the White House with us, and they didn’t see how hard Joe worked every single day. I mean, he’d get up, he put in a full day, and then at night he would, I’d be in bed, you know, reading my book, and he was still on the phone, reading his briefings, working with staff. I mean, it was nonstop.<br>He put in a full day like a grown-up, she says, as Joe stares ahead, confused. Why is Joe all dressed up there at The View table anyway? Dr. Jill, just let him rest, good Lord. [Quái!]<br>→ Old people get enough already: Republicans have a new tax proposal that would give seniors another random $4,000 tax deduction. Why? Why not? They talk about wanting birth rates up, but the truth is, we’re in a gerontocracy. To prepare my children for the only bosses they’ll have, I softly sing to them:<br>Nibblin’ on sponge cake / Watchin’ the sun bake... Wastin’ away again in Margaritaville / Searchin’ for my lost shaker of salt / Some people claim that there’s a woman to blame / But I know / It’s nobody’s fault.<br>It needs to live in their bones so they stand a chance at a future here. So they know how to relate to their 115-year-old overlords.<br>→ Ode to David Hogg: Young David Hogg, recently elected a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, really is going to lose his seat and face another election. Because his election didn’t exactly follow the DNC gender-balance rules, determined each month based on the alignment of Saturn and the height of the waves. Yes, he is a man, and that cannot stand. David Hogg survived a school shooting and clawed his way to the top of the political food chain with savvy instincts, a quick wit, and a true passion for being on TV - only to be felled by his overwhelming maleness. My bet is that this is his villain origin story. When David Hogg is a red-pilled podcaster saying women shouldn’t have the right to vote, I want everyone responsible for this moment to reflect a little. David Hogg will be yukking it up with Tucker and the Saudis, and we’ll know that this was literally his only career path. The DNC will finally be run by a perfectly balanced tri-gender humanoid, and that humanoid will have lost every single election, and we’ll be paying for meals in Qatari riyals, but we’ll know that the genders are aligned - and balanced.<br>→ Keir Starmer is getting hardcore: Speaking of red-pilled, did someone hack Keir Starmer’s Twitter/X account? The prime minister of Britain, head of the Labour Party, is suddenly coming out fervently against immigration. “I’ve already returned over 24,000 people with no right to be here. And I won’t stop there,” he wrote this week. And another: “Settlement in the UK is a privilege that is earned, not a right.” On and on he went with this tough talk. Whoa there, Kier, if you want to go on a date with Tom Homan, just ask!<br>There’s a revealing interview on GB News with a young migrant whose answer to every question the reporter asks is “Give me.” It’s a little unfair because that is also the only phrase I learn in foreign languages (what else is needed besides that and “Is there a bathroom in these pyramids?”). Keir’s politics are now basically 2016 MAGA. He’s entering his Cinco de Mayo taco bowl era. (In Britain, to be 2025 MAGA is to risk arrest.)<br>Speaking of arrests, last week police in Kent, England, admitted they made a mistake when they questioned and detained a retired police officer in 2023 after he posted a warning about antisemitism in Britain. Responding to a tweet promoting anti-Israel marches, the retired officer wrote as a sarcastic critique: “One step away from storming Heathrow looking for Jewish arrivals... ” Six officers - six! - went to his home and handcuffed him, later detaining him in a jail cell for eight hours. They searched through his books, which included works by such authors as Free Press contributor Douglas Murray (suspicious), as bodycam footage captured an officer referring to his collection as having “very Brexity things.” Naughty naughty, you’ve been caught with Douglas. [Quái!]<br>Me, I have Douglas Murray manuscripts like you couldn’t imagine. I have worse. Charles Murray is squeezed between SCUM Manifesto and Camille Paglia. There are non–gentle parenting books, several very Brexity things, a little bowl of water and rose petals I leave for Hillary, and a labor-and-delivery book called Orgasmic Birth that my wonderful accountant sent me and, suffice it to say, it didn’t work. British police, upon seeing my shelves, would probably shoot themselves, except they’re unarmed, so they would just kind of paddle each other until they all fainted.<br>→ Gavin really, super duper means it this time: Gavin Newsom called for all California cities to ban homeless encampments and remove them “without delay.” Newsom provided cities with a model ordinance to implement to do so, and also released $3.3 billion to communities across the state to “expand behavioral health housing and treatment options for the most seriously ill and homeless in California.” Ending homeless encampments is something Gavin periodically announces over his 20-year career. Like the groundhog predicting spring, when it feels right, Gavin will wander through a tent city and shake someone awake from their relaxing fentanyl nap. Be sure to get this on camera, guys. [Trời ơi!] Alas, it is all part of the circle of life. Homelessness ends now, Newsom says every few months, at a podium, while the people around him melt. <br>More below, on the American pope, Theranos: The Sequel, and Where I TG. But first, an illustration from our dear friend, David Mamet:<br>→ Pope Leo’s brother is the best new character: Pope Leo’s brother, a self-described “MAGA type,” had his past tweets read back to him on Piers Morgan’s show. First of all, the pope’s brother agreed to go on Piers Morgan. Second of all, here was one that our man reposted: “These effing liberals crying about tariffs is just unreal. Do they not know that there’s a thing called video? Just listen to what this drunk [Nancy Pelosi] has to say in the mid-’90s, long before her husband had Grindr dates.”<br>And his narration now, as Brother of Pope, explaining it: “I posted it, and I wouldn’t have posted it if I didn’t kind of believe it. However, I had no idea that what was coming was coming this soon. And I can tell you, since then, I’ve been very quiet, biting my tongue.” Bro, this is your tongue-biting? Friends, we are in for a great papacy. The papacy is about to contend with an insane Facebook brother, who is also a Florida Man. There are going to be fights on the Vatican patio over who is running the barbecue that Europeans will simply be unable to comprehend. Romans: Prepare thyselves.<br>I don’t think I was really prepared for an American pope. The fact that the pope always spoke a language I didn’t understand added to his mystery and charisma. And I liked to imagine the pope emerging from the sky, virgin births without even needing the mother. Now the pope is a guy from Chicago whose brother is posting about Pelosi. Now the pope is being discovered in fancam footage from a baseball game. This pope has probably consumed a corn dog!<br>Louis, the Brother of Pope, also recounted how the now-pope used to “play priest” when he was little: “We used to play like boys and play boys’ games, whether it was sports, or cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, whatever it might be. Rob liked to play priest. ... He’d do his pretend saying mass, pass out holy Communion with the Necco wafers. . . . It was his thing.”<br>Last note on this is, I love how hard The Washington Post is working to make sure you never think the word hallelujah is from Hebrew.<br>→ UC Berkeley votes against Hindu Heritage Month: The UC Berkeley student senate voted against Hindu Heritage Month, citing “Hindu nationalism,” despite the university’s observing several other heritage months. Hindus are not allowed heritage time! Stop asking for heritage awareness, Hindus. You must sit in shame next to the Irish Pride group and the campus Israel club (it is an awkward combo in there, I gotta warn you). Certain heritages’ self-awareness needs to be suppressed, and UC Berkeley is adding Hindu to that list. The failed resolution had recognized contributions to the Berkeley community by people of Hindu heritage, and called on students to “support their Hindu peers on campus.” No. Stop asking. As your debutante arbiter of who is white, and what to do with edge cases, I’ll be clear: Greeks and Italians are ethnic and may celebrate, though not for a whole month, just a heritage week. Basically a food festival and that’s it. But Hindus are white. I can’t explain why but it’s true.<br>→ No fast math for you: Palo Alto Unified School District voted to remove honors biology as an option for the smart kids, after already having removed honors English, lest some advanced reader get to talk to other advanced readers (on this I support Palo Alto wholeheartedly). “They call it de-laning,” said Silicon Valley congressman Ro Khanna. “I call it an assault on excellence. I took many honors classes at Council Rock High in PA.”<br>Being somewhat familiar with Palo Alto, a wealthy, highly competitive school district, let me tell you what’s going on, just based on gut: The white parents are mad that the advanced classes are disproportionately Asian. And they think their kid will have a better shot at an Ivy League spot if it’s harder for the college to tell who’s smart and who is, like, really smart. But guys, colleges already will discriminate against the smart Asians. You don’t have to cancel biology to get there. [Quái chiêu!]<br>→ MAHA, what are you people doing: The EPA announced that it will reconsider acceptable limits of four PFAS “forever chemicals” in drinking water. It goes without saying, but the chemicals in question are linked to a number of serious illnesses. Where are you, my MAHA princes? It’s not all chickenpox parties, boys. It’s not all posting pictures of our latest tallow face moisturizer.<br>Credit where it’s due: Lee Zeldin, EPA administrator, said that the EPA will take action against stop-start technology, which turns off a car’s engine when it’s stopped. It is one of those random things that actually doesn’t help the environment at all but makes people feel good. A little environmental guilt is good, and I don’t want people placated by false idols (recycling, car engine turnoffs, paper straws, carbon offsets).<br>→ Sir, are you stealing our motto?: They say imitation is the highest form of flattery.<br>We love you, A.G. Because of your sweet nepo hands (takes one to know one), dropping the ball on everything interesting and hard in the hardest and most interesting time, we could leave and build something really fun. Wait, I think you’re late to the Intern Listening Session. They have feedback for you, A.G.

Of course that’s what it’s called.

Ending years of isolation of the Kremlin, the Trump administration has offered numerous concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin, raising hopes among some Western observers that the United States might be able to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine after more than three years of fighting. <br>So far, although Russia has shown an interest in engaging with Trump, there is little indication that it is prepared to wind down its military operations. But even if the administration’s efforts succeed in bringing the Russian government to the negotiating table, there is a far larger obstacle to achieving peace: Russia’s dramatic internal evolution since the war began.<br>The war in Ukraine is central to Putin’s legitimacy, leaving him no rational incentive to end it voluntarily. At least since the end of 2022, the Kremlin has portrayed its war in Ukraine as a “war with NATO,” and confrontation with the West has become a key element of the regime’s ideology. To truly end the conflict, therefore, will likely require little short of a change of regime in Moscow - and one driven by actors within Russia who neither benefit from the war nor align with Putin. The current U.S.-led effort to jump-start peace talks has largely set aside the more crucial question of a long-term strategy toward Russia, both under Putin and after Putin.<br>Already well before 2022, the character of the Putin regime had changed significantly, as Putin moved away from the West. For years, the Kremlin had been building an ultraconservative, revisionist ideology centered around antimodern values. After 2012, when Putin returned to the presidency, the Kremlin began tightening its grip on Russia’s elites, embracing an archaic militarism, and widening its repression of civil society. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and especially over the past year, however, that evolution has gone much further. Putin had expected a quick and cheap victory, not a protracted war; the situation has forced him to accelerate the restructuring of Russia’s political, economic, and social systems to tighten his grip on the nation. Along with a progressive militarization of the Russian economy, these changes have created severe tensions within the regime.<br>The United States ignores these internal changes at its peril. Rather than preparing for a postwar future of renewed relations with the United States and Europe, Putin has put Russia on a slippery slope of self-reinforcing and perpetual conflict with the West. If the regime gets its way over the next three to four years, Russia could arrive at a sociopolitical equilibrium that looks less like a capitalist authoritarian country with private-sector elites and more like a North Korean–style militarized autocracy. For the Kremlin, such an equilibrium could help it withstand even major challenges to its rule, as Pyongyang did during a devastating economic crisis in the 1990s. Moreover, given Russia’s large size and military strength, this kind of transformation could also pose profound risks to global security.<br>Yet Putin’s bid to remake the Russian state has also created new vulnerabilities for the regime. The Russian economy has become deeply imbalanced, with the country’s overwhelming dependence on oil revenues to support war-related fiscal expansion. Especially amid sinking global oil prices, this has made the Russian budget especially vulnerable to further sanctions. Moreover, tensions are emerging among Russian elites as a result of Putin’s efforts to push aside existing business leaders, bureaucrats, and others in favor of loyalists who adhere to the regime’s ideology or at least pay lip service to it, such as war veterans. To prevent Putin and his inner circle from consummating this transformation, the West will need to exploit these vulnerabilities. But this will require applying more economic and military pressure on Russia while simultaneously sending signals and offering incentives to potential elite dissenters - those most affected by the Kremlin’s rapid and forceful transformation of Russian society and who are potentially capable of stopping it.<br>RESTIVE ELITES<br>Political scientists have long identified three primary threats to autocracies: military defeats, popular uprisings, and palace coups. For nuclear-armed Russia, a full military defeat by an external power is implausible. Moreover, like other authoritarian regimes, the Kremlin has devoted major resources to neutralizing opposition forces within Russian society and has an extensive apparatus for suppressing potential uprisings. Nevertheless, the potential for a seizure of power by members of the existing bureaucratic hierarchy, supported by elements of the military and business elites, remains a significant risk. As a result, Putin has shifted much of the Kremlin’s focus to Russia’s elites.<br>Consider the Prigozhin mutiny. In June 2023, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Wagner, the Kremlin-supported private military company, was able to seize the city of Rostov-on-Don, including the Southern Military District headquarters overseeing the war in Ukraine, with no resistance. He also tried to march his men on Moscow. Few among the bureaucratic, business, and even military elites denounced the mutineers, exposing limited support for Putin. This weakness was underscored five days later, when Putin felt compelled to meet with Prigozhin and Wagner commanders to stabilize the situation, despite having publicly accused Prigozhin of treason. Although the crisis was quickly defused and Prigozhin was eliminated two months later, the mutiny dealt a significant blow to the regime.<br>The elites’ lack of loyalty to Putin in 2023 was no accident. Since the 1990s and the early years of this century, Russia’s business leaders and upper level bureaucrats have been focused on attaining economic independence - using Russia’s relatively open market for personal material gain. For many years, the Russia state allowed private sector capitalism to flourish relatively unimpeded. In their implicit contract with Putin, Russian elites ceded political authority in exchange for wealth and personal freedom, but they were not required to risk their lives or fortunes for the state or its leader. Nor did the Kremlin have much control over their business activities and sources of wealth. But the mutiny underscored for Putin that the country’s current business leaders and high-level bureaucrats cannot be relied upon at moments of regime crisis. At the same time, the Kremlin’s Mafia-like hierarchy of power is inherently fragile, relying on a shared belief in the leader’s strength and the regime’s perpetuity. Up to the present, this system has been largely held together by rents, primarily from hydrocarbons, making it susceptible to dangerous weakening by economic sanctions or the need to mobilize vast resources for war. These factors have made Putin’s Kremlin particularly vulnerable to shifts in perception among the top strata of Russian society.<br>THE END OF NORMAL<br>The Kremlin’s growing concerns about unreliable elites have been heightened by Russia’s fragile economic outlook. At first glance, despite over three years of sweeping sanctions and war, the economy has been resilient. Through much of the first couple years of war, the government was able to inject significant funds into the economy, thanks to the efficiency of the private sector, the use of large accumulated reserves, poorly structured sanctions, and windfall revenues in 2022. This fueled economic activity, wage growth, and rising demand. The regime could simultaneously finance the war, meet social obligations, and distribute economic rewards to elites. This apparent wartime boom sustained the illusion of normalcy. The war also created new opportunities, particularly through niches left by the exit of foreign businesses -  although these have now been exhausted.<br>Beneath the surface, however, the picture is bleaker. Military spending has spiraled out of control, creating a budgetary black hole. Defense spending has more than doubled, from $65.9 billion in 2021 to $149 billion in 2024, and continues to go up. Not the least of the growing costs are the huge incentives and signing bonuses the government must now pay volunteers to recruit them into the armed forces, as well as payments for North Korean “services.” (Thus far, the Kremlin’s payments to Pyongyang for ammunition and military participation are estimated to have reached $20 billion.) Putin’s May 2024 replacement of his longtime defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, with the economist Andrei Belousov, was intended to impose fiscal discipline on the military, but there have been few discernible efficiency gains. For 2025, military expenditure will amount to 32.5 percent of the entire federal budget. To maintain this level, the government is for the first time reducing social spending: clearly, Putin can no longer sustain the illusion of normality.<br>By shifting toward a mobilization economy, with the state as the primary customer not only for defense but across other key sectors, the government has created severe fiscal strain. In contrast with previous years with surpluses, the budget has run deficits since 2022 - $33 billion in 2022, $32 billion in 2023, and $34 billion (1.7 percent of GDP) in 2024. With no access to foreign capital, this seemingly small budget deficit will become more and more threatening every year. For now, it is being covered mainly by drawing on the National Welfare Fund, which as of April 2025 had only $35.4 billion in liquid assets.<br>    Putin is reshaping Russia’s elite in ways that echo North Korea’s social hierarchy.<br>To offset costs, the government is raising personal and corporate income taxes and cutting social spending more than 10 percent. Meanwhile, oil price declines have led to a tripling of the official budget deficit forecast, leaving remaining reserves barely sufficient to cover the gap. A further oil price drop or new sanctions could force even deeper cuts to nondefense spending. These cuts may affect elites too, for example, by reducing federal subsidies to potentially rebellious regions like Chechnya. The government has also resorted to printing money, further fueling inflation.<br>The labor market is equally strained. Worker shortages following Putin’s September 2022 mobilization and mass emigration have forced civilian sectors to raise wages to compete with the military. Consumer demand is increasingly met by imports, weakening the ruble and pushing prices up. To curb inflation, the Central Bank raised its key interest rate from 7.5 percent in July 2023 to 21 percent in October 2024; nevertheless, inflation reached 9.5 percent at the end of 2024 and exceeded 10 percent by March this year. Experts from government think tanks and institutions warn of a potential inflationary spiral. High interest rates also limit the viability of domestic borrowing. Along with interest rate hikes, exchange rate volatility has increased the risk of corporate defaults.<br>These intertwined issues have significantly raised the chances of broader economic destabilization. A global financial crisis, coupled with OPEC’s expansion of the oil supply, could sharply depress prices for Russian exports, leading to uncontrolled inflation and the collapse of the ruble. Even without such shocks, continued downward pressure on oil prices and new sanctions are likely to have devastating medium- and longer-term effects. Adverse economic trends may erode public confidence in the regime’s durability and shrink the rents available to elites, undermining the foundations of the existing hierarchy of power. To counter this risk, the Kremlin has accelerated its efforts to transition to a new model of political and social control and replace the most unreliable segments of the political and business elite with loyalists personally tied to Putin.<br>KOREAN COERCION<br>For Putin’s Kremlin, building a new kind of regime has involved several interconnected elements. One is a shift in official narratives about the war. Until the fall 2023, for example, state propaganda maintained that there was no war, only a “special military operation” - a strategy that allowed most citizens to carry on their ordinary routines. By late 2023, however, the state narrative began to shift, and the Kremlin began also to refer to a new permanent “war” with the West. The Kremlin also started talking about Russian elites in terms of their loyalty to the regime. In February 2024, Putin addressed the Federal Assembly, declaring that elites were no longer those who “lined their pockets in the 1990s” but rather the “workers and warriors” who were proving their loyalty through action. This rhetoric was quickly echoed by figures such as Alexander Dugin, the far-right ideologist, and Sergey Karaganov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, who had called for a nuclear strike on Poland in 2023, as well as various government officials. In June 2024 Alexei Chekunkov, a former investment banker who had become Minister for the Development of the Russian Far East, publicly criticized Russia’s entrepreneurial culture of the 1990s and proposed a model of “patriotic socialism” instead.<br>This new rhetoric has been backed by targeted actions against members of the elite and prominent cultural figures. The “almost naked party” scandal of December 2023 - when several show business figures were caught flaunting a defiant dress code - marked a fundamental shift in the relationship between the state and citizens. The Kremlin deemed such a display unacceptable in wartime and began asserting its right to intrude into private life -  something even the late Soviet Union, from the 1960s onward, generally avoided. With its heavy-handed reaction, the regime signaled for the first time an intent to regulate private behavior, using tactics increasingly reminiscent of North Korea or Iran.<br>To reinforce regime loyalty, Putin also launched, in February 2024, a new program to integrate top military veterans into the workforce. Called “Time of Heroes,” the initiative seeks to channel former soldiers who are handpicked for their fealty and management skills into political posts. Although local politicians initially resisted, and sought to exclude veterans from party lists in the September 2024 regional elections, graduates of the program were assuming regional leadership roles by the end of the year. Through processes such as these, the Kremlin has set out to incrementally replace traditional elites with its own loyalists. Along with the arrest of seven corrupt generals (including three former deputy ministers), Putin’s May 2024 sacking of Shoigu was part of an effort to address internal dissatisfaction about pervasive corruption in the military hierarchy. In fact, these changes to some extent echoed earlier demands by Wagner leader Prigozhin. Such purges also provide opportunities for officers actively involved in the Ukraine war to advance within the military hierarchy.<br>At the same time, the Kremlin has begun an increasingly aggressive effort to nationalize private-sector assets. In 2022, the government began seizing assets belonging to foreign owners who left Russia when the war started. The following year, it began a more limited effort targeting Russian-owned assets as well. As of March this year, over 411 companies both foreign and Russian, with a combined value of $30 billion, have been nationalized, representing about 5 percent of the total capitalization of the Moscow Exchange. But even these numbers do not reflect the broader effects of this campaign on the Russian business community. Informal threats of nationalization have become an effective way for the government to coerce business owners to cede their property to politically favored individuals at a minuscule share of its market price.<br>    A large share of Russia’s private assets are at risk of state seizure.<br>The government has also begun consolidating key industries under Kremlin-linked entities. Since mid 2023, the Kremlin-affiliated Roskhim group has expanded its dominance of the chemical sector. In February 2024, the Rolf car dealership was nationalized and subsequently transferred to a Kremlin affiliate. And in June of that year, Russia’s biggest online retailer, Wildberries, was taken over by regime-affiliated groups. In January 2025, the General Prosecutor’s Office also requested the nationalization of the Domodedovo airport near Moscow, on the grounds that its main owner has Turkish and UAE citizenship as well as Russian. In March, Vadim Moshkovich, the billionaire owner of Rusagro, Russia’s leading agricultural conglomerate, was arrested for alleged criminal fraud. Also this year, in a new tactic, the government has begun seizing property from some of the country’s largest business owners.<br>It no longer appears to matter what legal pretext the security forces use to justify these asset and property seizures or arrests. Increasingly present in these actions are various groups with coercive power, including current and former employees of state security agencies (including Putin’s body guards), and such figures as Ramzan Kadyrov, the former warlord and close Putin ally who is head of the Chechen Republic and who has a personal army. Amid the Kremlin’s dwindling revenue streams and growing demands from these groups, the redistribution of property has become a primary government resource. The exact mechanism of redistribution - whether through nationalization, criminal charges, or outright business takeovers - is irrelevant. The government now uses the law as a weapon to expropriate property from bona fide owners, including those previously seen as regime supporters. Loyalty no longer guarantees protection unless the target in question has informal access to Putin. As Russia’s available economic resources shrink, the regime’s only way to reward those with coercive power is by reallocating assets - often at the expense of even loyal business owners - further raising tensions within the elite.<br>A logical extension of the Kremlin’s property-redistribution campaign came this month, when the Constitutional Court ruled that the statute of limitations for disputes over privatization should begin not from the date of the transaction but from the completion of a prosecutor’s investigation identifying violations. This decision effectively eliminates any time limit on the review of privatization deals from decades earlier - many of which contain legal flaws. This means that a large share of Russia’s private assets are now at risk. This threat has been exacerbated by severe constraints on the outflow of private capital from Russia - both because of increased informal FSB control over capital movement and the short-sighted design of Western sanctions, which have effectively trapped private capital inside the country.<br>FORTRESS MENTALITY<br>The final piece of the Kremlin’s effort to remake the state is ideological change. At least since 2012 Putin has sought to build and enforce a dominant ideology built on illiberal values and historical revisionism. Once-marginal ideas from the Izborsky Club, an antimodern think tank, have increasingly gained mainstream acceptance, including the view that Russia is a “besieged fortress.” Yet the Kremlin has failed to offer a positive vision of the country’s future. Instead, in an effort to preempt dissent amid economic hardship, it has intensified efforts to isolate Russian citizens from independent information. Independent media have been crushed, and the number of political prisoners has surpassed that of the late Soviet period.<br>These interconnected measures reflect a comprehensive effort to build a state that will soon have many of the attributes of the North Korean model. Putin has adopted autarkic self-reliance and other ideas that appear to draw on North Korea’s Juche ideology - the doctrine formulated by Kim Jong Il in 1982 that seeks to foreground national economic and military self-reliance. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin has also forged a military alliance with Pyongyang and is now reshaping Russia’s elite in ways that echo North Korea’s social hierarchy.<br>The Kremlin is unlikely to abandon this project anytime soon. The inherent inflexibility of the mafia-state structure, the transformation of the elites (by self-selection before 2022 and forced restructuring since then) , the growing reliance on those with coercive power, and the effect of years of ideological indoctrination of the people have reinforced the regime’s shift toward a North Korean model. Moreover, the survival of the new system requires perpetuating the confrontation with the West, which has become Putin’s legitimating cause, as well as declaring periodical “victories” in this struggle. These forces have produced a vicious circle. The war in Ukraine has given rise to powerful, well-organized groups in Russia that have a vested interest in the conflict’s continuation and the exacerbation of the war with the West. Putin can no longer buy the support of public employees as he once did and now substitutes them with war beneficiaries such as defense industry workers, whose incomes have risen dramatically, as well as contract “volunteers” and their families, whose earnings have also increased several times over. These constituencies are better organized than public employees and, in the case of veterans, possess military experience that is desirable to the Kremlin. But their inclusion only further militarizes the state and heightens the risk of new conflicts as war and coercion become societal norms.<br>Comparing Putin’s new state to an updated version of the Brezhnev-era Soviet Union, as some Western analysts have done, is misleading. Unlike the Soviet elite of the late Cold War, who prioritized stability and coexistence with the West, Putin’s inner circle lack a coherent ideological framework or long-term vision. Communist ideology, for all its flaws, provided the Soviet leadership with a structured worldview. In contrast, contemporary Russia has no constructive development model. Dmitry Medvedev’s presidency from 2008 to 2012 (during which Putin served as prime minister) briefly hinted at a modernization agenda, but it yielded no substantial outcomes or long-term vision. By 2012, it was clear that Russia’s ruling elite was destined to lose under any global order. This has left the Kremlin with few options other than global destabilization and geopolitical blackmail, a strategy for which the Kim regime in Pyongyang provides a powerful model. In deciding on this course, Putin has also rendered futile any attempts to cajole, lure, or appease him.<br>A RUSSIAN RESCUE?<br>If Russia, with its large nuclear arsenal, were to make a full transition to North Korean autocracy, it would pose enormous geopolitical challenges. Such a regime would also be a natural close ally to China. But this trajectory is not inevitable. To succeed, the new model will require far greater state control over citizens’ lives and harsher curtailments of personal freedoms. Labor shortages and xenophobic tensions against migrants will heighten the challenge, raising the likelihood that the government will have to coerce the population on a larger scale.<br>The initial erosion of political freedoms in Russia - beginning with the Yukos affair in 2003 (when the company’s CEO and main shareholder was convicted of tax evasion and fraud) and culminating in the constitutional amendments of 2020 - was gradual and, for many years, offset by rising living standards or at least promises of stability. Now, the Kremlin has little to offer aside from rising taxes, price inflation, and harsher state interference. The primary victims will not be ordinary citizens but the business and bureaucratic elites, who have the most to lose and are most likely to be replaced by regime loyalists who lack independent power bases or private-sector wealth.<br>If the government continues to tighten repression at a time of diminishing resources and gloomy economic outlook, it could destabilize the country. Opposition from within the elite, fueled by systemic financial and governance pressures, could trigger a breakdown. Still, such crises might not result in immediate regime change, since Russia currently lacks the prerequisites that would be needed. As of now, no major and powerful elite group in Russia could clearly gain from unseating Putin. As a result, a partial collapse could lead instead to prolonged instability, akin to what has happened in Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro, but with the added risk posed by Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Still, the prospect of increased repression and redistribution of property, especially combined with some positive alternative, might encourage those who stand to lose most to confront the Kremlin.<br>The West is not irrelevant to Russia’s future. Western actions can either accelerate or impede the transformation of the Putin regime. Concessions that enable Putin to declare victory, not to mention achieve Ukraine’s outright defeat, could entrench him further in power. Moreover, the notion that a peace deal with Moscow will bring significant benefits to American business is an illusion. Many U.S. corporations have already lost billions of dollars in Russia; their assets were simply seized by the Kremlin and handed over to loyalists. In the absence of sweeping political change, there is no guarantee that the Kremlin will not do the same in the future. Alternatively, continued and stepped up Western military aid for Ukraine and increased sanctions on Russia could expose the regime’s vulnerabilities. But sanctions that are perceived as purely punitive risk strengthening Putin’s narrative that the West is an enemy of the Russian people.<br>For the United States and its allies, there is not much time left to steer Russia from its current path. So far, the West has failed to present a compelling postwar vision for Russia and a plan to achieve it - one that is realistic internationally and that can directly appeal to Russians themselves. Such a vision - when combined with Russia’s failure to achieve military success and effective sanctions designed to undermine the regime’s power structures rather than punish Russian society as a whole - could help send the right signal to disgruntled Russian elites, encouraging them to risk challenging Putin’s rule before their own situation deteriorates further. But if current trends are allowed to continue, Europe may soon encounter a completely militarized autocracy on its borders that is similar to North Korea’s in structure, and far more dangerous. And the United States might have to countenance a military union between Russia and China.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R58" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">59</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:6035px;left:-1px">ĐÊ TRÁNH RỦI RO – HOA KỲ CẦN THỂ HIỆN QUYẾT TÂM!<br>Trên tạp chí Foreign Affairs, hôm nay ba học giả đề cập tới rủi ro lớn vì quan hệ quá gay go giữa Trung Cộng và Đài Loan.

Even before Taiwan elected William Lai as its president, in January 2024, China voiced strong opposition to him, calling him a “separatist” and an “instigator of war.” In recent months, Beijing has ramped up its broadsides: in mid-March, the spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office labeled Lai a “destroyer of cross-Straits peace” and accused him of pushing Taiwan toward “the perilous brink of war.” Two weeks later, as Beijing launched a large-scale military exercise around Taiwan, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) circulated cartoon images that portrayed Lai as an insect. One image depicted a pair of chopsticks picking the “parasite” Lai out of a burning Taiwan.<br>This effort to dehumanize Lai reflects Beijing’s deep anxiety about the trajectory of cross-strait relations, particularly what China views as Lai’s desire to push Taiwan toward independence. Compared with his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, Lai has taken a stronger and more defiant stance in the face of growing Chinese threats to the island, as evident in his rhetoric and new policy measures. This March, Lai characterized Beijing as a “hostile foreign force” and announced a plan to implement 17 wide-ranging strategies to defend the island from Chinese infiltration.<br>China’s vilification of Lai echoes Beijing’s denunciations, roughly two decades ago, of Chen Shui-bian, then president of Taiwan. Beijing labeled Chen a “die-hard separatist” and “a troublemaker” who “is riding near the edge of the cliff, and there is no sign that he is going to rein in his horse.” Beijing escalated external pressure against Chen and worked with opposition parties within Taiwan to frustrate his political agenda. China did come dangerously close to using military force against the island in 2008 and might have gone through with it if Chen had been more successful in winning Taiwan’s public support for his referendum.<br>Beijing’s attitude now should very much concern Washington. China does not view Lai’s rule as merely a continuation of that of Tsai. Instead, Beijing sees Lai as a disruptor like Chen and is treating him much in the same way. Since Lai became president, Beijing has demonstrated growing willingness to use military might to intimidate and punish the island. And it is far more prepared to use force against Taiwan today than it was 20 years ago.<br>Apparent divisions within U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration about how to approach Taiwan compound these risks. If Beijing doubts U.S. commitments to the island, that could encourage China to engage in more coercive actions against Taiwan. All these factors dramatically increase the chances that Beijing will miscalculate - and that it could very well use force against the island around 2027, as China approaches critical military modernization milestones and Taiwan gears up for its next presidential election.<br>ESCALATION SPIRAL<br>China’s official narratives have long emphasized that its peaceful unification with Taiwan is inevitable. But in recent months, anxiety has mounted in Beijing that Lai intends to systematically decouple Taiwan from China. Chinese media outlets have accused Lai of militarizing Taiwanese society as Lai prioritized efforts to increase Taiwan’s defensive resilience, reinstated the military court system to handle espionage and treason by Taiwan military officials, and accelerated training and preparations for the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Beijing is highly critical of Lai’s efforts to thwart Chinese infiltration and to counter Chinese cognitive warfare, arguing that Lai is preventing the resumption of tourism, suppressing and prosecuting pro-Chinese groups and individuals, discouraging Taiwanese citizens from applying for Chinese identification documents, imposing barriers on academic collaboration between universities in China and Taiwan, and altering Taiwan’s textbooks to undermine historical and cultural affinity.<br>In March, a Chinese government spokesperson claimed that Lai’s 17 strategies were aimed at “obstructing exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait.” China has also denounced Lai’s efforts to encourage Taiwanese businesses to invest more in democratic countries, including in the United States. Beijing has cast these measures as doomed to fail and mocked Taipei when the United States threatened to impose high tariffs on the island in April.<br>Many Chinese analysts believe that Lai’s political position is weak compared with that of his predecessor, Tsai. But they worry that this weakness may make Lai bolder, as he might want to ramp up confrontation with China to try to win public support.<br>Based on this analysis of Lai and domestic conditions in Taiwan, hawkish voices within China are urging an ever more aggressive approach toward Taiwan. Some are calling for the use of military force against the island or the resurrection of so-called civil war operations, nonpeaceful ways for Beijing to unify with the island, such as by imposing a maritime blockade of the island. Other hawks have publicly wondered whether Beijing can engineer a crisis in Taipei similar to the 1936 Xian incident, in which generals serving under Chiang Kai-shek - who was leading the government of the Republic of China and its Nationalist forces - seized Chiang and forced him to ally with the Chinese Communist Party to fight against Japanese forces that had invaded northern China.<br>A more resonant parallel may be to one of the most dangerous periods during Chen’s tenure. To boost turnout in Taiwan’s March 2008 presidential election, Chen paired that vote with a popular referendum on whether the island should join the United Nations under the name Taiwan instead of the Republic of China.<br>This proposal came perilously close to crossing a redline for Beijing: in 2005, Beijing had passed the Anti-Secession Law, which established China’s right to use military force against Taiwan under several conditions, including if “major incidents entailing Taiwan’s secession from China should occur.” When the law was passed, a spokesperson for the Chinese government suggested that an island-wide referendum could be considered a major incident. And in 2007, after Chen proposed the referendum, Chinese President Hu Jintao warned U.S. President George W. Bush that Beijing interpreted the Taiwan referendum in this way.<br>Beijing accompanied these warnings with significant military signaling. China increased its deployment of short-range ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan sevenfold from the beginning of Chen’s term in 2000 to early 2008. Before the referendum, the Bush administration detected that the PLA had put mobile short-range missile units near the Taiwan Strait on heightened alert. The U.S. military and intelligence community believed that China could fire missiles around Taiwan, as it had during the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis - or, worse, China could actually attack the island.<br>Fortunately, the 2008 crisis passed without bloodshed. Low voter turnout invalidated Chen’s referendum, and the opposition Kuomintang candidate beat the candidate from Chen’s Democratic Progressive Party in the presidential race. U.S. deployment of significant forces near Taiwan may also have given Beijing pause. Taking the risk of escalation seriously, Washington had publicly opposed Chen’s referendum and positioned two aircraft carriers to the northeast and southeast of Taiwan, and a third near Singapore, ahead of the vote. Nevertheless, the episode suggested that Beijing was serious about using force if provoked by what it viewed as “pro-independence” activities.<br>BAD OMENS<br>Since the 2008 crisis, China’s military capabilities have grown significantly. Its army, navy, and air force have rapidly modernized, and its conventional rocket forces now field a far more capable array of longer-range missiles, including advanced hypersonic and antiship ballistic missiles. China has also doubled the size of its nuclear arsenal over the past five years. Beyond advances in hard capabilities, Chinese President Xi Jinping has launched sweeping organizational reforms to enable the PLA to conduct more joint high-tech operations, and he has waged unparalleled anticorruption campaigns to root out obstacles to military readiness.<br>Beijing’s willingness to use its military is growing, too. China has long engaged in military exercises to hone its capabilities and intimidate Taiwan. During Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou’s tenure from 2008 to 2016, Beijing limited these provocations as it sought to encourage greater cross-Strait engagement. But China resumed major exercises when Tsai, who emphasized Taiwan’s sovereignty and security, succeeded Ma. In August 2022, toward the end of Tsai’s term, China mounted larger and more provocative drills near Taiwan than it had ever held before.<br>Now the pace and scale of Chinese military activities are increasing. Not even a year into Lai’s term, China has broken precedent by staging three large-scale exercises, which were given names to raise their profile and distinguish them from smaller drills.<br>In a significant shift, the PLA is now using such large-scale military exercises to punish Lai’s administration for domestic political acts. All of China’s past major exercises - in 1995–96, 2022, and 2023 -were launched after Taiwan’s leaders traveled to the United States or met with senior U.S. officials. Last December, China did engage in a major - but unnamed - drill after Lai made stops in Hawaii and Guam on a tour of the Pacific. But all three recent large-scale exercises responded to domestic speeches or statements by Lai.<br>These military activities have become markedly more provocative, unpredictable, and complex. In April’s exercise, named Strait Thunder-2025A, PLA naval vessels reportedly ventured within 24 nautical miles of the island’s shores. China is engaging in large-scale operations around Taiwan year round and increasing activities to the east of Taiwan. In a break with the past, the PLA now provides little or no advance warning of its drills. This has raised concerns in Washington and Taipei about how much lead time the United States and Taiwan might have should China decide to use force to seize the island.<br>In another shift from earlier years, recent rounds of exercises have witnessed China’s coast guard joining with the navy to practice blockading Taiwan. China’s maritime militia, a state-backed network of civilian vessels often deployed to assert Chinese territorial claims, has also become increasingly involved. The participation of these new actors suggests that China is preparing to conduct a broad variety of operations, such as an invasion, a PLA navy–led blockade, and a Chinese coast guard–led quarantine of Taiwan.<br>Finally, China is also operating across a bigger geographic range: its exercise in December involved one of the largest-ever deployments of maritime forces from all three of the PLA’s coastal commands. China conducted operations around Taiwan and in the East China and South China Seas, demonstrating its ability to dominate areas within the first island chain - an arc of islands and countries in the Western Pacific stretching from Japan to parts of Indonesia - and block external forces from entering to assist Taiwan.<br>Apart from such major operations, China now conducts near-daily military incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, a self-declared area that extends beyond the island’s official airspace. In 2024, the Chinese military flew a record-shattering 3,075 sorties into this zone, an increase of over 80 percent from 2023. These operations aim to delegitimize Taiwan’s claims to its surrounding air and seas and complicate Taiwan’s ability to monitor and track activities around the island.<br>Some of these air incursions occur as part of “joint combat readiness patrols,” involving not just air assets but also coordinated maritime operations. These patrols are now occurring on a near-weekly basis and offer China opportunities to quickly step up coercion against Taiwan short of much larger-scale exercises. Days after Lai unveiled his 17 strategies in March, for instance, China launched two joint combat readiness patrols and then followed up two weeks later by holding its Strait Thunder-2025A exercise.<br>WILD CARD<br>U.S. officials are issuing warnings about these remarkable Chinese military activities. In February, Samuel Paparo, the head of the U.S. military’s Indo-Pacific Command, asserted that China’s “aggressive maneuvers around Taiwan right now are not exercises.... They are rehearsals.”<br>               &quot;Washington must ensure that China clearly understands the resolve of the United States.&quot;<br>Yet as China increases its military activities against Taiwan, many in Beijing don’t know where Washington stands. Beijing is relatively confident that the Trump administration wants to intensify competition with China, with a particular focus on the economic relationship. Chinese analysts also generally believe that Trump will try to use Taiwan as a card in this competition, but there is no consensus on how he will do so.<br>Chinese experts assess that Trump and his team are divided on Taiwan. Many believe that Trump wants to negotiate deals with China and that he and many of his supporters want to avoid foreign military entanglements. But national security hawks in the administration, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, are still focused on checking Chinese aggression and influence. Chinese interlocutors note that Trump’s national security team is not receptive to Chinese concerns about Lai, and they worry that when it comes to day-to-day Taiwan policy, this administration will likely strengthen relations with Taipei through deepened cooperation and increased arms sales.<br>These conflicting assessments leave Beijing less certain that the United States will defend Taiwan from large-scale attacks or lower-intensity scenarios. But Chinese officials believe that, if left unchecked, the United States is likely to move even closer to Taiwan. That creates a dynamic ripe for miscalculation. China could determine that it needs to treat Taiwan more aggressively to make it clear to Trump’s national security team that it will tolerate neither growing U.S.-Taiwan ties nor moves by Taiwan that it sees as provocative. Meanwhile, China’s perception that Trump is not altogether willing to defend Taiwan may lead Beijing to consider still more escalatory actions against the island.<br>COURSE CORRECTION<br>U.S. and allied policymakers must not overlook these shifts in China’s perceptions of Taiwan and its actions regarding the island. As Lai’s term continues, Beijing and Taipei are likely to enter an even more dangerous situation. Chinese experts believe that Lai may take more radical measures to promote Taiwan’s independence in 2027 ahead of the next presidential elections. If Lai is not faring well in the polls, Chinese analysts worry that he could ratchet up his anti-Beijing stance to win electoral support, much as Chen did in 2008. Xi himself has set a deadline of 2027 for the PLA to have the capability to forcefully take Taiwan. Given Xi’s push to accelerate the PLA’s modernization, it is unlikely that his military leaders will tell him in 2027 that China is not capable of successfully executing large-scale military operations against Taiwan, meaning that Xi may feel more confident then - and willing to provoke a crisis or conflict.<br>Beijing’s diminished patience and hardened intent make it even more important for the Trump administration to ensure that China clearly understands the resolve of the United States and its willingness to counter Chinese aggression. There is extraordinary work that the United States must do to deter a conflict or, failing that, to deny and defeat Chinese military adventurism. In addition to building up its own military capabilities - as well as those of Taiwan and its allies - and significantly increasing allied and partner defense spending, Washington must better integrate different elements of U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan to enhance deterrence and reduce the risks of misperception by potential adversaries. <br>This is important because Beijing is not just assessing American resolve by looking at what the United States is doing on defense. For example, as Chinese experts watch the U.S.-Chinese tariff and trade negotiations, some are noting how rapidly Washington has both scaled up and temporarily backed down on tariffs, suggesting that Trump was bluffing initially and that the administration now recognizes that it needs to cooperate with China despite its focus on competition.<br>As the United States is moving fast on multiple fronts, it will be important to pay attention to how Beijing may be connecting the dots of different U.S. policies in cobbling together a larger understanding of American strategy and intentions. To the extent that China is misunderstanding the United States, it will be crucial for the Trump administration to correct and push back against Chinese narratives, both in public and in private.<br>If the Trump administration does not want a crisis on its hands, it should not leave such a door open for Beijing. The Taiwan Strait will be volatile enough over the next few years without adding to the mix muddled Chinese perceptions of what the United States is willing - or not willing - to do.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R59" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">60</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:4316px;left:-1px">THẮNG RỒI ĐÃ VẬY – MÚA GẬY… DẠY CON!<br>Sau mấy ngày công du tráng lệ, Donald Trump phải thấy tình hình hơi tệ ở nhà, khi đảng Cộng Hòa lo vượt ải ngân sách.

He’ll have to take a stand.<br>Kimberley A. Strassel<br>(By Kimberley A. Strassel - WSJ - May 15, 2025 5:12 pm ET)<br>image<br>President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the White House in Washington, Feb. 10. Photo: Alex Brandon/Associated Press<br>With House Republicans in the endgame of their reconciliation bill - and at an impasse - Speaker Mike Johnson may soon have no choice but to call in the big guns. At which point we’ll find out if the political howitzer known as Donald J. Trump sides with his own agenda of reform - in which he has already invested significant political capital - or with Republican Party business as usual.<br>The current House GOP standoff boils down to the usual: To spend or not to spend. To date, the spenders - or as the media charitably describes them, the “moderates” - have run the table. Their initial demands required House leaders to set a pathetic target of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years, allowing the Joe Biden spending boom to stand and grow. They then proceeded to throw up roadblock after roadblock in the way of even that $1.5 trillion mark. Congress remains littered with their red lines: No reining in ObamaCare’s Medicaid expansion. No messing with prior “infrastructure” spending. No serious overhaul of food assistance. No starting any real reform until 2029, so that lawmakers have time to roll it back.<br>To add injury to entitlement, they are demanding that any money saved - over their objections - be earmarked for their voters. Having already won a promise that they’d get a reprieve from today’s $10,000 cap on deductibility of state and local taxes, no amount will suffice. Double isn’t good enough. Nor is triple or quadruple. New York Republicans suggested this week that they might consider voting for a GOP bill that spares the country $4.5 trillion in tax hikes - but only if their constituents are allowed to deduct $80,000 worth of state and local taxes from their federal returns. Most Americans don’t even earn $80,000.<br>But the cheek that tipped conservative frustration into fury was Wednesday’s additional demand from 14 “moderates” - on top of their SALT extortion, on top of their reform roadblocks - to continue spending with abandon on Joe Biden’s Green New Deal. Virginia’s Rep. Jen Kiggans issued the group declaration taking issue with reconciliation plans to tighten boondoggle tax credits to climate companies, since “clean energy” matters. Read: Continued corporate subsidies are vital for our re-election.<br>House Republicans who still believe in limited government and spending restraint have been largely overlooked in all the focus on the moderate braying. Their warnings were largely ignored, as leaders catered to the squeaky wheels of Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon and New York Rep. Mike Lawler. But the fiscal hawks are no less necessary to passing this bill, given that Mr. Johnson can’t lose more than three votes. And they’ve now more than had it. Texas’ Rep. Chip Roy suggested he would vote against the legislation in a planned Friday Budget Committee meeting, and he’ll have company on the floor if changes aren’t made. An equally fiery group of Senate conservatives is throwing down a similar challenge.<br>These intraparty chasms may now be too wide to be bridged, which means the more likely path to a bill - if one even remains - is for one side to bend. Only one figure in the party has the political muscle to force such an outcome. The president has kept deliberately quiet in public about the state of negotiations and his own preferences. The assumption was always that he’d engage at the end, when the time came to knock heads into line over final outstanding questions. Only where does he now come down?<br>That will be the test of whether he actually believes in the reforms he promised on the campaign trail and the actions he’s taken his first months. What was the point of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency - and the media and litigation onslaught -  if Congress whiffs on even the basic cuts and changes necessary to lock in DOGE’s work? What’s the point of the president’s farsighted actions to unleash American energy, if Congress is knee-capping it with distortionary renewable subsidies?<br>Why should the president have even weathered the political storm that came from stating important truths - Medicaid has a lot of waste and fraud, work requirements should accompany welfare, the climate agenda is punishing American businesses and consumers - if Republicans in Congress ultimately surrender to the left’s talking points? For Mr. Trump, standing his ground is the obvious course, especially because voters’ belief that he would do what he says is what won him the office.<br>Yet don’t discount the populist whisperers, who seek to reduce this debate to simple vote-buying. They are telling Mr. Trump he needs to up the SALT ante to buy the New York and New Jersey House seats; to water down welfare reform to buy more low-income voters; to abandon Medicaid changes to buy “working class” support. Never mind that vote-buying is the Democratic Party’s approach to elections - and look how that’s turned out.<br>Either way, enter Mr. Trump. The party will need some pushing to get this done. Watch carefully in what direction Mr. Trump shoves.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R60" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">61</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:4283px;left:-1px">CHRISTINE LAGARDE LẠI PHẢI LÀM JEANNE D’ARC!<br>Tổ chức WEF (World Economic Forum) do Klaus Schwab sáng lập từ hơn nửa thế kỷ lâm khủng hoảng nặng nề.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images<br>Jack Phillips<br>(By Jack Phillips - The Epoch Times - 5/15/2025)<br>President Donald Trump on Thursday morning weighed in on the U.S. Supreme Court hearing arguments in a case involving his order to limit birthright citizenship, arguing that the current law is being exploited.<br>Earlier this year, Trump issued an executive order to limit birthright citizenship, which was halted by several federal judges. The case is now in the hands of the Supreme Court after the administration submitted an emergency appeal to the highest court.<br>“Big case today in the United States Supreme Court. Birthright Citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent Citizens of the United States of America, and bringing their families with them, all the time laughing at the ‘SUCKERS’ that we are!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday.<br>He said the United States “is the only Country in the World that does this, for what reason, nobody knows - But the drug cartels love it!”<br>Going further, Trump said that the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which was ratified in 1868 and three years after the end of the Civil War, was designed to provide citizenship to children born to enslaved people.<br>“Remember, it all started right after the Civil War ended, it had nothing to do with current day Immigration Policy!” Trump wrote.<br>The first sentence of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment reads: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”<br>It and the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery except as punishment for a crime, were ratified about a decade after the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision. That decision upheld slavery in U.S. territories and states while denying that black people could be considered citizens.<br>On his first day in office, Trump issued an order that made reference to the Dred Scott case, with the White House stipulating in a statement that the 14th Amendment “has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.”<br>“The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not ’subject to the jurisdiction thereof,&#39;” the White House said.<br>Birthright citizenship is among several issues, many related to immigration, that the administration has asked the court to address on an emergency basis, after lower courts’ rulings hampered the president’s agenda.<br>In Thursday’s arguments, the nine justices will be weighing whether judges have the authority to issue what are called nationwide, or universal, injunctions. The Trump administration, like the Biden administration before it, has said that judges are overreaching by issuing orders that apply to everyone instead of just the parties before the court.<br>The administration is asking for the court orders to be reined in, not overturned entirely, and spends little time defending its executive order on birthright citizenship. The Justice Department points out that there has been an “explosion” in the number of nationwide injunctions issued since Trump retook the White House. The far-reaching court orders violate the law as well as long-standing views on a judge’s authority, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote on behalf of the administration in its petition.<br>One of the judges who ruled against the administration, Judge Danielle Forrest of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote in February that the government has not been able to argue that the current circumstances “demonstrate an obvious emergency” to issue the order.<br>A separate ruling issued by the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also blocked Trump’s order.<br>“The Government expressly declines to make any developed argument that it is likely to succeed on appeal in showing that the Executive Order is either constitutional or compliant with” federal law, the court said in a unanimous decision.<br>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R62" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">63</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2457px;left:-1px">REUTERS THIẾU CHUYÊN NGHIỆP<br>THẬM CHÍ BẤT LƯƠNG TRONG ĐỀ TỰA!<br>Hồ sơ &quot;birthright&quot; có nhiều nguyên nhân phức tạp mà hệ thống truyền thông quốc tế này làm như trăm tội là vì Trump.

None of the justices, however, signaled an endorsement of Trump&#39;s order and some of the liberals said it violates the Constitution and the court&#39;s own precedents.<br>The justices heard more than two hours of arguments in the administration&#39;s emergency request to scale back the injunctions blocking Trump&#39;s directive, which is a key part of his hardline approach toward immigration. Three judges found that Trump&#39;s order likely violates the Constitution&#39;s 14th Amendment citizenship language.<br>Trump signed his order on January 20, his first day back in office. It directed federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of U.S.-born children who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident, also known as a &quot;green card&quot; holder.<br>Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said she believes Trump&#39;s order violates multiple Supreme Court precedents concerning citizenship. Sotomayor said the court should weigh the order&#39;s legality &quot;if we are worried about those thousands of children who are going to be born without citizenship papers that could render them stateless&quot; and leave them ineligible for government benefits.<br>More than 150,000 newborns would be denied citizenship annually if Trump&#39;s order takes effect, according to the plaintiffs who challenged the directive, including the Democratic attorneys general of 22 states as well as immigrant rights advocates and pregnant immigrants.<br>The case is unusual in that the administration has used it to argue that federal judges lack the authority to issue universal injunctions, and has asked the justices to rule that way and enforce Trump&#39;s directive even without weighing its legal merits. U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, arguing for the administration, focused on this issue, calling the increasing use by judges of universal injunctions a &quot;pathology.&quot;<br>In potentially restricting the ability of lower courts to issue universal injunctions in certain instances, the conservative justices raised the idea of requiring plaintiffs to funnel claims seeking broader relief into class-action lawsuits, which are filed on behalf of a group of people who suffer similar legal injuries.<br>Complicating matters, some justices - conservatives and liberals alike - also seemed reticent to rule without further delving into the underlying legal merits of Trump&#39;s directive. It remained uncertain whether the court would order further briefing, which would further delay resolution of the case.<br>Conservative Justice Samuel Alito asked Kelsi Corkran, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, &quot;Should we decide or make up our minds on the underlying birthright citizenship question without briefing and argument and deliberation?&quot;<br>Corkran said the justices should take up the case specifically on the merits of Trump&#39;s order, adding, &quot;The government is asking the court to allow it to ignore this court&#39;s precedents ... and to upend 100 years of executive branch practice.&quot;<br>The plaintiffs argued that Trump&#39;s directive violated the 14th Amendment, which long has been understood to confer citizenship on almost anyone born on U.S. soil. It was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War that ended slavery in the United States.<br>The 14th Amendment&#39;s citizenship clause states that all &quot;persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.&quot;<br>The administration contends that this citizenship language does not extend to immigrants in the country illegally or immigrants whose presence is lawful but temporary, such as university students or those on work visas.<br>&#39;ALL KINDS OF ABUSES&#39;<br>Without a universal injunction blocking Trump&#39;s order, it could be years before the Supreme Court finally decides its constitutionality, liberal Justice Elena Kagan said.<br>&quot;There are all kinds of abuses of nationwide injunctions,&quot; Kagan told Sauer. &quot;But I think that the question that this case presents is that if one thinks that it&#39;s quite clear that the (executive order) is illegal, how does one get to that result in what time frame, on your set of rules without the possibility of a nationwide injunction?&quot;<br>Sauer noted that after the dispute percolates in lower courts, the Supreme Court can ultimately pronounce on the legal merits of the policy, prompting conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett to express skepticism.<br>&quot;Are you really going to answer Justice Kagan by saying there&#39;s no way to do this expeditiously?&quot; Barrett said.<br>Sotomayor compared Trump&#39;s directive to a hypothetical action by a president taking away guns from every American who owns one despite the constitutional right to keep and bear arms.<br>Sauer said that since Trump returned to the presidency, federal judges have issued 40 universal injunctions against his administration&#39;s policies.<br>&quot;This is a bipartisan problem that has now spanned the last five presidential administrations,&quot; Sauer said.<br>VARIATIONS BY STATE<br>The administration is seeking to narrow the injunctions to apply only to the individual plaintiffs and the 22 states, if the justices find the states have the required legal standing to sue. That could allow the policy to take effect in the 28 states that did not sue, aside from any plaintiffs living in those states.<br>Jeremy Feigenbaum, the lawyer arguing for the states, said states face high and costly hurdles in managing difficulties in distributing government benefits if the order takes effect and citizenship is applied in a patchwork fashion, adding that class-action cases are &quot;not available for state litigation.&quot;<br>Feigenbaum said the legal issue surrounding Trump&#39;s executive order was resolved by the Supreme Court 127 years ago.<br>An 1898 Supreme Court ruling in a case called United States v. Wong Kim Ark long has been interpreted as guaranteeing that children born in the United States to non-citizen parents are entitled to American citizenship. The administration has argued that the court&#39;s ruling in that case was narrower, applying only to children whose parents had a &quot;permanent domicile and residence in the United States.&quot;<br>The 14th Amendment overrode an infamous 1857 Supreme Court decision called Dred Scott v.

CASA on the growing use of national or universal injunctions. This is a matter submitted on the “shadow docket” and the underlying cases concern the controversy over “birthright citizenship.” However, the merits of those claims are not at issue. Instead, the Trump Administration has made a “modest request” for the Court to limit the scope of lower-court injunctions to their immediate districts and parties, challenging the right of such courts to bind an Administration across the nation.<br>The case is the consolidation of three matters: Trump v. CASA out of  Maryland; Trump v. Washington out of Washington State, and Trump v. New Jersey, out of Massachusetts. These cases also present standing issues since the Administration challenges the argument that there is a cognizable “injury” to individuals who may travel to the states bringing the actions.<br>However, the main question is the scope of injunctions.<br>As I have previously written, district court judges have issued a record number of injunctions in the first 100 days of the Trump Administration. Under President George W. Bush, there were only six such injunctions, which increased to 12 under Obama. However, when Trump came to office, he faced 64 such orders in his first term.<br>When Biden and the Democrats returned to office, it fell back to 14. That was not due to more modest measures. Biden did precisely what Trump did in seeking to negate virtually all of his predecessors’ orders and then seek sweeping new legal reforms. He was repeatedly found to have violated the Constitution, but there was no torrent of preliminary injunctions at the start of his term.<br>Yet, when Trump returned to office, the number of national injunctions soared again in the first 100 days and surpassed the number for the entirety of Biden’s term.<br>This is a rare argument. First, it is a shadow docket filing that usually results in summary decisions without oral argument. Moreover, this matter came after what is commonly viewed as the final day for oral arguments. The Court granted a rare late oral argument, reflecting that multiple justices view this matter sufficiently serious to warrant a break from standard operating procedures.<br>Rather than arguing a “question presented” on birthright citizenship, the Administration is solely looking for limits on the district courts as appeals continue on the “important constitutional questions” raised by birthright citizenship.<br>The Administration argues that the Constitution does not give judges the power to issue universal injunctions and that courts are limited to addressing the cases before them in a given district. The Administration acknowledges that class actions can create the basis for universal injunctions, offering a moderate resolution to the Court. In such cases, if the parties can meet the standard for a national class, they can seek a national or universal injunction.<br>In today’s arguments (which I will be covering for Fox and on X), we can expect to hear from justices who have previously been critical of universal injunctions, including Justice Clarence Thomas, who, in his concurring opinion in Trump v. Hawaii, called them “legally and historically dubious.”<br>Likewise, Justices Gorsuch and Alito have criticized such injunctions. In a prior dissent to an emergency filing in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, Alito was joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh in stating that the government “has a strong argument that the District Court’s order violates the principle that a federal court may not issue an equitable remedy that is ‘more burdensome than necessary to’ redress the plaintiff’s injuries.”<br>Many of us will be watching three members the most closely: Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett. Roberts is the ultimate institutionalist, and we should see in his argument how he views the impact of such injunctions on the court system as a whole. He is very protective of the courts’ inherent authority but may also have misgivings about the scope of these orders.<br>During the Biden Administration, Justice Kagan has previously criticized universal injunctions. In an interview at Northwestern University Law School, Kagan flagged the “forum shopping” by litigants in filing cases before favorable courts:<br>“You look at something like that and you think, that can’t be right. In the Trump years, people used to go to the Northern District of California, and in the Biden years, they go to Texas. It just can’t be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through the normal process.”<br>Justice Barrett previously joined with Kavanaugh in stating that the power of district courts to enter a universal injunction “is an important question that could warrant our review in the future.”<br>The argument today will start at 10 am and I will be doing a running review of the arguments on X.<br>U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer will argue the government’s case.<br>Jeremy Feigenbaum, New Jersey’s solicitor general, will argue for the state and local governments and  Kelsi Corkran, the Supreme Court director at Georgetown’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, will argue for the private individuals and groups.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R64" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">65</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:1857px;left:-1px">OVER MY SHOULDER by MAULDIN ECONOMICS<br>Hôm nay, tiết mục Over My Shoulder của Mauldin Economics lại đề cập tới thị trường trái phiếu (là giấy nợ, bonds) của giới đầu tư: Họ cho vay tiền để hưởng tiền lời, gọi là phân lời hay yield, cao thấp là tùy kỳ hạn dài hay ngắn và tùy các rủi ro nhiều hay ít. <br>Sau khi Patrick Watson tóm lược (và lưu ý rằng cổ phiếu lên giá mà “thị trường trái phiếu không tin”) là thẩm định của Brusuelas với đồ biểu đưa lên hình cho dễ đọc: đường tuyến màu đen là chỉ số cổ phiếu S&amp;P 500, màu lục là phân lời Công khố phiếu 10 năm<br>By Patrick Watson | May 15, 2025<br>Joseph Brusuelas: The Bond Market Isn&#39;t Buying It<br>Why You Should Read: RSM economist Joseph Brusuelas flags an important market divergence: Stocks are recovering while Treasury bond yields have resumed rising.

Đồ biểu ở cuối bài]<br>THE BOND MARKET IS NOT BUYING IT<br>(By Joseph Brusuelas - May 15, 2025) <br>The recovery in equity valuations over the past month has been impressive. Driven by the United States’ pulling back from a multifront trade war, the S&amp;P 500 index is essentially flat for the year as of May 14 after a 15.28% plunge through April 8. <br>But the bond market is seeing something different. <br>Instead of yields falling as equity valuations have recovered, the fixed income market has focused on the shaky and incoherent foundation of the trade conflict, the unimpressive revenues earned from trade taxes and the growing probability that tax legislation will feature a large tax cut funded by government debt. <br>Given the risks to the economy - a recession is still a coin flip this year - and recovery in the equity markets, bond yields should be falling. <br>They are not, and that is because fixed-income investors are sniffing out the logic of economic populism amid a move toward trade protectionism, which strongly implies higher inflation and rising long-term yields. <br>Of course, that results in additional compensation demanded by investors for holding U.S. Treasury securities under such conditions which is also known as the risk premium. And the increase in yields is exactly what has happened over the first two weeks of May. <br>Should Congress approve a large tax cut that is not paid for, don’t be surprised if the bond market pushes yields back toward mid-April highs, which captured the pushback against the trade conflict. <br>With the U.S. 10-year yield trading late Wednesday at 4.54% - the high this year is 4.792% - and the 30-year at 4.97%, nearly at this year’s high of 4.974%, remember that any move above 5% at the long end of the curve will result in nothing but trouble and likely bring to an end the recent relief rally in equities. <br>If investors are looking for a reason to sell in May and go away, it would appear that the bond market might be providing an important forward-looking signal given the plans of the fiscal authority, trade and tax policy.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R65" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">66</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:3557px;left:-1px">HỢP TÁC VỀ ‘AI’ TẠI TRUNG ĐÔNG LẠI CÓ LỢI CHO TRUNG QUỐC?<br>Ban tham mưu của Trump thiếu thống nhất về chương trình hợp tác về Trí Tuệ Nhân Tạo AI với các nước Trung Đông vì có thể đem lại lợi thế cho Trung Cộng.

Such chips are used to develop and train models that can mimic human intelligence, and they’re the most coveted technology of the AI age.<br>Some senior administration officials are seeking to slow down the deals over concerns the US hasn’t imposed sufficient guardrails to prevent American chips shipped to the Gulf from ultimately benefiting China, which has deep ties in the region, according to people familiar with the matter. While the UAE and Saudi accords include high-level language barring Chinese firms from accessing those chips, these officials argue too many details are still unresolved and the deals shouldn’t be announced without legally binding provisions, the people said.<br>China hawks also have grown alarmed over what they see as a willingness by White House AI Adviser David Sacks, who’s helping lead the talks, to entertain proposals from Gulf leaders that they view as clear national security risks. None of those proposals are included in the current bilateral accords in the Middle East.<br>Beyond those security issues, some senior Trump officials question the wisdom of shipping such large quantities of chips to any location outside the US, given the administration’s focus on maintaining American dominance in AI, said the people. As Vice President JD Vance put it at a Paris AI summit in February, “the Trump administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American designed and manufactured chips.”<br>If the announced and planned Middle East deals all come to fruition, the US would still hold the vast majority of the world’s computing power - but Gulf countries would for the first time have significant capabilities powered by best-in-class US hardware.<br>A representative for the White House didn’t provide official comment for this story, which is based on interviews with nearly a dozen people who spoke about internal administration discussions on condition of anonymity. Nvidia and a spokesperson for the UAE declined to comment, while Sacks, AMD and the Saudi Arabian government didn’t respond to requests for comment.<br>US President Donald Trump, left, and David Sacks, White House AI and crypto czar. Photographer: Samuel Corum/Sipa/Bloomberg<br>Advocates for the deals, including Sacks, argue that if the US doesn’t encourage the world to use American chips, countries with AI ambitions will eventually turn to alternatives from Chinese companies - which have made progress in closing the gap with Nvidia, the industry leader.<br>“We need our friends, like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other strategic partners and allies, to want to build on our tech,” Sacks said Tuesday while on stage with Saudi Arabia’s minister of communications and information technology. The possibility of that tech winding up in China is “not an issue with a friend like Saudi Arabia at all,” he said.<br>Not everyone in the Trump administration agrees. In escalating conversations over the past two days, several senior officials have discussed strategies for slowing the implementation of Gulf AI agreements - and pumping the brakes on projects that have yet to be unveiled, the people said. One concern is a bilateral accord between the US and UAE that could include a massive project by OpenAI, the industry pioneer behind ChatGPT.<br>Trump arrived in Abu Dhabi on Thursday after stops earlier this week in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Officials on the ground were still in active negotiations the morning of the president’s visit, according to people familiar with the matter, who added that they expect the deals to move forward in the near term.<br>If that happens, China hawks may press their concerns through the regulatory process in Washington. All AI chip shipments to the Gulf require US government approval through a licensing process involving several federal agencies. Administration officials are also in the middle of drafting global semiconductor export control rules after tossing out a framework introduced by President Joe Biden. That provides another opportunity to include specific China guardrails and other strategic priorities.<br>Sacks, along with other officials who support the Gulf projects, has made the case that aggressive proliferation with security provisions would be a strategic win for the US - and crucial for maintaining American leadership in AI.<br>Part of Sacks’ argument - echoed by tech leaders including Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang - is that the US lead over China in advanced chipmaking is shrinking. If Washington prevents countries with AI ambitions from building data centers with American technology, the logic goes, the US risks ceding those markets to its main geopolitical rival. Companies may choose to buy chips from the likes of Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese tech giant at the center of Washington’s efforts to curtail Beijing’s AI ambitions.<br>On the other side of the debate, some officials in both the Trump and Biden administrations have argued that America’s technological lead is quite large and enables Washington to write the rules of the road for as long as other countries still covet American chips. Policymakers can afford to be aggressive in negotiations, these officials argue, and shouldn’t allow countries to access best-in-class American hardware without concessions and ironclad security promises.<br>Trump officials in this second camp think they may be losing the internal fight over Middle East chip shipments - especially after the UAE and Saudi Arabia offered a combined $2.4 trillion in US investments that helped pave the way for the recent AI deals. In particular, some senior administration officials have grown wary of negotiating positions adopted by Sacks, who has been one of the central players on the ground as government officials and tech executives hammer out the accords.<br>In one meeting with Emirati officials ahead of Trump’s trip, Sacks expressed openness to the UAE housing a production facility from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the leading maker of chips for the likes of Nvidia and AMD, people familiar with the matter said. The UAE has long coveted such a plant and asked the US government for its support as part of the broader chip accord.<br>The hawkish Trump officials view a possible TSMC plant in the UAE as dangerous, the people said. Supporting the UAE’s ambitions to manufacture AI chips domestically would create unnecessary national security risks given the country’s ties to Beijing, the officials argue, especially if political alliances change in the future. The current accord doesn’t include a TSMC plant, though separate conversations about such a project remain ongoing. TSMC declined to comment.<br>Another lingering concern with the UAE is G42, the leading Abu Dhabi-based AI firm with historic ties to Huawei. Although it agreed to divest from Huawei and other Chinese providers to pave the way for a $1.5 billion partnership with Microsoft Corp. last year, some US officials remain wary of G42’s commitment to American priorities. Now the Trump administration is considering an agreement that would allow G42 to buy the equivalent of more than a million Nvidia H100 accelerators, among the chipmaker’s top offerings, Bloomberg has reported.<br>Critics of that accord include the chairman of the House China Select Committee, which last year released a video detailing the bipartisan panel’s G42 concerns. The voiceover in that video comes from Landon Heid, Trump’s nominee for a top position at the agency that writes chip export rules and decides whether to approve individual semiconductor sales.<br>Details of the security requirements in the broader UAE accord will be sorted out in a working group composed of American and Emirati officials, according to the people familiar with the matter. Topics already in the agreement include provisions to prevent diversion of chips to China and bar Chinese AI companies from remotely accessing UAE facilities. Sacks has been angling to steer efforts to write the fine print, the people said - something that several of his US counterparts oppose.<br>At one point in negotiations with Saudi Arabia, Saudi officials suggested they may install US chips in facilities that contain Huawei hardware, the people said, adding that the hardware in question was not Huawei’s AI chips. The US delegation shot down that suggestion in the meeting, but after the fact, Sacks suggested that Trump’s team should at least evaluate the idea. While some officials understood Sacks’ reaction as a suggestion to consider national security concerns on a technical basis, others saw it as an immediate disregard for why US officials would hold those concerns in the first place.<br>For officials who view Huawei as a red line in Washington’s China policy, the exploration of that possibility was unacceptable. The idea is not part of the current accord, people familiar with the matter said.<br>“The policy objective of preventing diversion to countries of concern is an absolutely important objective of the United States but it is not a difficult one to achieve,” Sacks said during his Middle East appearance. “The truth of the matter is that all one would have to do is send someone to a data center and count the server racks to make sure the chips are still there.”</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R66" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">67</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:1857px;left:-1px">QUỐC HỘI MỸ MẤT DẦN SỰ TÍN NHIỆM CỦA CỬ TRI<br>Sau khi đọc bài nhắc nhở vừa yết của Freddy Gray trên The Spectator, xin hãy đọc tin của Sharyl Attkisson như một lời khuyên nhủ khác:<br>Tổ chức khảo sát dân ý (rất có uy tín) Rasmussen vừa công bố kết quả thăm dò ý kiến của cử tri Hoa Kỳ về Quốc Hội.

I know I did. The line was too tempting. As Trump stormed back into the White House, his power looked irresistible. His enemies seemed so broken and defeated.<br>We all spoke too soon. “Never Trumpism” is a reaction to Trumpism, as natural as magnetic repulsion and the urge to defy and destroy his presidency hasn’t vanished. In fact, look closely and you can see a “Resistance 2.0” gathering momentum in response to the second Trump administration.<br>The arguments for the next impeachment of Donald Trump are being tested ahead of the 2027 midterms and they will center, once again, on the possible corruption of the Trump family and its associates through vast sums of Middle Eastern cash. Trump is going to Abu Dhabi today and he seems cock-a-hoop at all the trillions of dollars in Arab investment deals that are coming his way. “I want to thank the media,” he said yesterday, magnanimously, at a meeting in Qatar. “The media, I have to say, has been very fair. They’re having a hard time saying bad because this is a record tour that will raise… it could be a total of $3.5-4 trillion.” Everybody loves big numbers.<br>But Trump is deluding himself if he can’t see the negative publicity spinning out of his golden grand tour of the Levant. There’s the Qatar Force One story – the news that Trump has accepted a $400 million luxury jet as a gift from the government in Doha. The aircraft is meant to replace the aging Air Force One aircraft and Trump professed himself incredulous as to the outrage over the present. “Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,” he said.<br>But the Israel hawks surrounding Trump are displeased with his new friendship with the Qataris, who are, according to the official line from Tel Aviv, state sponsors of terrorism, the evil Robin to the badman Batman that is Iran. If Trump continues to fall out with Benjamin Netanyahu – and dares to strike some kind of nuclear deal with Tehran – the jet gift story will be pushed as evidence of a sinister “quid pro quo” with the Muslim Brotherhood. Remember it was allegations of a “quid pro quo” offer to Volodymyr Zelensky that caused Trump’s first impeachment in 2019.<br>But the jet story will be just one arrow in the Resistance 2.0’s quiver. The bigger looming scandal is World Liberty Financial (WLF), the crypto business which the Trump sons launched at Mar-a-Lago last September. It hasn’t gone unnoticed that, this month, an Abu Dhabi investment firm used a WLF “stablecoin” to invest $2 billion in Binance, the online crypto platform. WLF’s co-founder is Zach Witkoff, son of Steve, Trump’s Middle East envoy, and the whole enterprise has more than a whiff of Hunter Bidenish depravity about it. Crypto is still the wild west of the digital future and riddled with nefarious operators, some alarmingly close to the First Family. And the WLF story is already being connected to the $Trump coin scandal – the obviously bogus crypto currency that the president helped launch in the week of his inauguration. A number of Trump associates made a lot of very fast money out of that.<br>Democrats claim to be shocked by the sheer brazenness of the Trump family’s double-dealing. “It’s hard not to be simultaneously terrified at the thought of the damage he can cause with such power and awed by his willingness to brazenly shatter so many harmful taboos,” Rob Malley [thực tế là kẻ làm công cho Iran!], who helped broker Barack Obama’s deal with Iran in 2015, tells Axios. But without a congressional majority, Trump’s opponents remain impotent.<br>The question then turns towards the mid-terms: if Trump loses his slender advantage in the House of Representatives, as he did in 2018, the Democrats will make White House “kleptocracy” their number-one issue and move to impeach him once more. That is unlikely to remove him from office, as the Democrats surely won’t have a sufficiently large Senate vote to terminate the presidency. Still, as Trump continues his pharaonic world diplomacy, the corruption stories are piling up against him. And if most Americans don’t start feeling richer as a result of these petro-trillions flooding into the tech-dominated American economy, the stench will start to overpower.<br>The above is taken from Freddy Gray’s weekly Americano newsletter.

CASA, which challenges lower court rulings that blocked President Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants.<br>Despite the constitutional authority granted to the executive branch on immigration matters, three district judges issued sweeping nationwide injunctions halting the order. Now, the highest court may have the chance to rein in judicial overreach and restore balance between the branches of government.<br>Since President Trump began his second term, liberal judges have weaponized nationwide injunctions against his administration an astonishing 17 times in just the first few months - and that’s only counting through late March 2025. This is nothing new, of course.<br>Even Newsweek seems to believe that the court will side with the Trump administration.<br>In recent years, some justices have expressed criticism of universal injunctions.<br>Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of the court’s conservatives, argued in a 2020 concurring opinion that injunctions are “meant to redress the injuries sustained by a particular plaintiff in a particular lawsuit.”<br>He said the “routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these conflicting decisions” and that the court must address them.<br>He also noted that nationwide injunctions mean that plaintiffs can shop around for the judge that is most likely to be sympathetic to their cause.<br>“Because plaintiffs generally are not bound by adverse decisions in cases to which they were not a party, there is a nearly boundless opportunity to shop for a friendly forum to secure a win nationwide,” Gorsuch wrote.<br>Even Justice Elena Kagan, one of the Court’s three liberal justices, has criticized broad nationwide injunctions and the blatant judge-shopping tactics used by plaintiffs to game the system.<br>This shouldn’t be a partisan issue because Joe Biden’s outgoing Solicitor General, Elizabeth Prelogar, also filed a brief in December 2024 asking the Supreme Court to limit these broad orders despite knowing Trump would benefit from the decision.<br>“In the Trump years, people used to go to the Northern District of California, and in the Biden years, they go to Texas,” Kagan said in 2022. “It just can’t be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through the normal process.”<br>Let’s be honest: Nationwide injunctions were never about judicial oversight. They’ve been the left’s go-to tool for blocking President Trump’s agenda through activist judges. With just one ruling, any of the hundreds of district court judges in the country can nullify federal policy they don’t like.<br>Now, the left is panicking. Without these judicial shortcuts, they’ll have to argue their cases on the merits instead of in front of cherry-picked friendly judges. Even Vox admitted these injunctions were “the core of the resistance.”<br>But that era may be ending. The Supreme Court looks poised to rein in this abuse of power and restore constitutional balance. For anyone who believes in law, not lawfare, this moment can’t come soon enough.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R70" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">71</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/15/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2957px;left:-1px">ĐẺ CON Ở ĐÂU, NÓ LÀ CÔNG DÂN Ở ĐÓ?<br>Sau Nội Chiến, một sơ xuất về cách diễn giải Tu Chính Án 14 đã gây nhiều vấn đề và nhất là lạm dụng về quyền là công dân ở nơi sinh đẻ (birthright).

Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press<br>Two huge debates collide at the Supreme Court on Thursday, and which direction the arguments will ricochet is hard to predict. First question: Can President Trump deny citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens? Second: Can a solitary federal judge in any outpost of this vast nation halt government action from sea to shining sea?<br>On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to reinterpret the 14th Amendment. He wants to exclude from “birthright citizenship” babies born in the U.S. to parents here illegally or temporarily, including on student or tourist visas. Three judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington issued “universal” injunctions to block that policy nationwide.<br>The Justice Department filed an emergency appeal to the High Court, seeking what it framed as “modest” relief. Complaining about the universal injunctions, it asked the Justices to whittle down the lower court rulings so they protect only the specific parties in the lawsuits. The Justices took the unusual step of setting emergency oral argument and could soon rule on citizenship, injunctions, or both.<br>***<br>The first question is straightforward. The 14th Amendment was ratified after the Civil War and the wretched decision in Dred Scott (1857), which said black former slaves and their descendants were excluded from U.S. citizenship. The amendment begins: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.” The dispute is whether illegal aliens are subject to U.S. jurisdiction.<br>The longtime interpretation suggests yes. In Wong Kim Ark (1898) the Supreme Court held that a man born in San Francisco to alien parents was a citizen. The majority held that the 14th Amendment affirmed “the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory,” including for “all children here born of resident aliens.” Exceptions included children born to foreign diplomats or to enemies in “a hostile occupation.”<br>This fits a plain reading of the amendment’s text. Foreign diplomats have legal immunity, a small example being their refusal to pay New York parking tickets. If some belligerent army were to seize part of the U.S., its troops obviously wouldn’t be “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” Illegal immigrants, by contrast, are both subject to federal law and routinely prosecuted and imprisoned for violating it.<br>Proponents of Mr. Trump’s theory argue that Wong Kim Ark’s parents weren’t living in the country illegally, meaning birthright citizenship for the children of transient border-crossers is an open question. Yet it takes hard work to read into the meaning of the 14th Amendment a distinction that seems not to be written there.<br>Mr. Trump has a better argument when he says federal judges are too quick to issue nationwide rulings. The Constitution empowers the judiciary to decide “cases” and “controversies,” which generally means relief for the parties at hand. As disputes percolate through the appeals courts, the judicial circuits might diverge. When a legal split gets serious, the High Court accepts a case to put things back on the level. That’s the theory, anyway.<br>What happens in practice, at least lately, is that the political faction out of power challenges the government’s every move in a friendly legal venue. “District courts issued 14 universal injunctions against the federal government through the first three years of President Biden’s term,” the Justice Department says in its emergency filing. “By contrast, courts issued 15 universal injunctions (or temporary restraining orders) against the current Administration in February 2025 alone.”<br>This rise in sweeping judicial orders hasn’t come out of nowhere. It’s happening in tandem with broad new assertions of executive power. Consider the halting of President Obama’s “deferred action” for illegal parents of citizen children. “We had 26 state plaintiffs,” former Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller said in 2019, defending that injunction. “The very nature of our challenge was that the federal government could not say that certain individuals were lawfully present in the country.”<br>President Biden’s effort to forgive $430 billion of student debt was frozen in a case involving Missouri’s loan servicer, Mohela. The Eighth Circuit considered a narrower injunction but saw “no workable path” to disentangle who’d be covered. If Mr. Biden had the leeway, he might have quickly wiped out everybody else’s debt, maybe while buying time by telling his Justice Department to dawdle in appealing his Eighth Circuit loss.<br>The worry about completely ruling out universal injunctions is whether that would enable abuses of executive power. There is plenty for the Justices to chew on here. But as a first bite, they at least could tell lower-court judges to think harder about the relief any given case demands, while reserving extraordinary injunctions for extraordinary situations.<br>Copyright ©2025 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

No way am I filling a 14-gallon tank with a week’s worth of Erewhon smoothie money. Absurd. And California Governor-slash-podcast bro Gavin Newsom knows it. Despite calling the fossil fuel industry the “polluted heart of this climate crisis” a mere year ago, he’s ordering officials to work with oil refiners to “ensure that Californians continue to have access to a safe, affordable and reliable supply of transportation fuels.”<br>At first, it looks like a classic political flip-flop in line with Newsom going after homeless camps and yanking health care from undocumented immigrants. Which, yes, Erika D. Smith and Liam Denning say it is - after all, the guy’s eyeing a presidential run in 2028. But, as they write, “it’s also evidence of rising tension between the state’s net-zero objectives and the economic woes of working-class Californians.”<br>For those unfamiliar with the Golden State’s squeeze on fuel prices, let me catch you up: Two refineries - one in the Bay Area and the other near Long Beach - are on the verge of closing. “The state is losing fuel production faster than it is losing its appetite for gasoline,” Erika and Liam explain.<br>The West Coast Premium<br>California&#39;s drivers pay about $1.30 extra per gallon of gasoline, or roughly 40% more, compared to the US average<br>Source: Energy Information Administration<br>Plenty of privileged Californians will look at that chart and wonder why gasoline prices even matter when the Trump administration is taking a chainsaw to the Constitution. But Latino communities - “the gardeners, nannies and construction workers who drive 100 miles roundtrip each weekday” - are scraping by, hence why they supported the candidate who promised to lower prices in 2024: “Trump’s vote share increased in all 12 of California’s Latino-majority counties. In all but one of those, people on average drive more each day and use more gasoline than for California as a whole, state data show,” Liam and Erika say.<br>California’s Unequal Pain at the Pump<br>People drive farther and use more gasoline on average in virtually all Latino-majority counties in California<br>Sources: California Energy Commission; California Department of Transportation; US Census Bureau; National Institutes of Health; CalMatters<br>Note: 2023 data.

It’s not as if Prius-driving, paper straw-drinking, tote bag-carrying Californians are going to become climate change deniers overnight. Wildfires, droughts and floods have already shown up on their doorsteps; they know climate change threatens their future. But that doesn’t change the fact that it’s a painful process that comes with financial hardships.<br>“It might take $192 trillion in global investment in clean energy and efficiency by 2050 to zero out the planet’s emissions and limit global warming to barely manageable levels,” writes Mark Gongloff.

Costs for fossil-fuel processes and power, conventional industry and internal-combustion engine vehicles not included.<br>As Mark says, it’s important not to think of clean energy spending as a one-and-done thing: “This isn’t buying a $2,000 cardigan at Saks,” he writes. “It’s buying a heat pump that trims your power bill by hundreds of dollars a year while also cutting the greenhouse-gas emissions heating up the planet and endangering your health, safety and personal finances.”<br>Gas pump pain is temporary! Heat pumps are forever.<br>Maximum Uncertainty<br>You really can’t make this stuff up: HBO went from HBO → HBO Max → Max back to HBO Max in, what, five years? They’re trolling us!! But maybe that’s the whole point:<br>What’s funny is that this feels like something President Donald Trump would do if he was a streaming executive! “Free outraged publicity” is his bread and butter. Think about the language we use to discuss the trade war: “Tariff whiplash.” “On-again, off-again.” “Escalate to deescalate.” All that uncertainty is part of Trump’s quest to stay relevant. He does that by being unpredictable. HBO is just trying to do the same thing.<br>But tariffs aren’t a branding exercise. They carry real-world consequences for the economy. The fact that nobody knows what’ll happen after the 90-day trade reprieve - which officially starts today, May 14 - between China and the US is not good. Bill Dudley says the pause “will lead businesses to delay purchase, investment and hiring decisions.” The “corrosive uncertainty” - his words, not mine - wrought upon by these tariffs gives the Fed little wiggle room, he argues: “When it doesn’t know which way the risks skew, it must wait for more information.”<br>You know what’s not waiting for more information, though? The stock market: “The S&amp;P 500, as of now, is showing a gain for 2025. It needs another 4.3% rise to set a record high. The basics of a 15% fall from the start of the year, then recouped in full, haven’t been achieved this swiftly since 1982,” writes John Authers.<br>Back in the Black for 2025<br>The S&amp;P hasn&#39;t rebounded like this since 1982 - start of a great bull market<br>Source: Bloomberg<br>Note: Re-based: 100 = Index level on Dec. 31 of preceding year<br>For the retail investors who didn’t panic and bought the dip, Marc Rubinstein says the market delivered “a gain of about 17% from the lows.” Bloomberg’s editorial board members are skeptical as to whether the happy-go-lucky vibes can be sustained, though: “If the promised talks should stall and tariffs are pushed back up, the mood is bound to reverse,” theywrite (free read).<br>It’s certainly reversed in Europe, thanks to Trump saying the EU is “nastier than China” (there’s that free outraged publicity again!). Paris-based columnist Lionel Laurent, who recently popped by our New York Bureau, says his trip made him “acutely aware of how the European continent is an object receding in the geoeconomic rear-view mirror.” Hmmm.

Gen. Rhett R.

Gorgon Jr., U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. ”Helping ISIS or any other terrorist organization prepare or carry out acts of violence is not only a reprehensible crime - it is a threat to our entire nation and way of life.”<br>Said was expected to make his initial court appearance on May 14. The U.S. Attorney’s Office stated that it would ask the court to hold him in pretrial detention because of his danger to the community and the risk that he could flee.<br>Sue J.

Andrew Harnik/Getty Images<br>A.R. HOFFMAN<br>(By A.R. HOFFMAN - NY Sun - Published: May. 14, 2025 04:33 PM ET - Updated: May. 14, 2025 05:04 PM ET)<br>The declaration from the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, that President Trump is contemplating suspending habeas corpus puts the adviser - who does not have a law degree - at the van of the 47th president’s legal agenda.<br>Mr. Miller’s primacy within Mr. Trump’s camarilla comes through in a profile of Attorney General Bondi that appeared this week in the Times. The Gray Lady reports that the administration’s agenda for the Department of Justice “has largely been set by Mr. Trump, his adviser Stephen Miller and other officials,” and that “it was clear from the start that Mr. Miller, who is not a lawyer, would exercise control” inside the DOJ. <br>The DOJ’s former top pardon lawyer, Elizabeth Oyer, who was fired by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and has been vocal about her unhappiness with the new administration, told the Times with respect of Ms. Bondi: “It feels like she is just performing a part. She is like an actor, in a way.” Ms. Oyer reflected that “the decisions are being made at the White House, and then they’re being pushed down to the Department of Justice, which is very, very atypical.”  <br>The influential Mr. Miller, who also serves as Mr. Trump’s homeland security advisor, shared with reporters that the suspension of the Great Writ was “an option we’re actively looking at.” Such a move appears to be motivated by a desire to advance Mr. Trump’s deportations efforts, which have been hampered by some district court judges who believe that illegal aliens should be able to access habeas.<br>The Constitution ordains: “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” The Suspension Clause, though, appears in Article I of the parchment, which established the Congress and suggests the Framers reckoned that the clause was a limitation on Congress - not a prerogative of the presidency. <br>Mr. Miller, the son of a successful California real estate lawyer, may not have a law degree, but he has demonstrated great facility at using the law to advance his objectives. In 2021 he founded a group, America First Legal, that successfully sued the government and other powerful organizations for illegal discrimination. In one major victory, he managed to thwart President Biden’s efforts to give $5 billion in reparations to Black farmers. <br>Immigration has long been Mr. Miller’s favorite assignment - he is a hardliner - and he ran policy on that front during Mr. Trump’s first term. He was a primary author of the travel ban that was, after several iterations, upheld - in a 5-to-4 ruling - by the Supreme Court as constitutional  in the case of Trump v. Hawaii. Mr. Miller also supports ending birthright citizenship. The Nine will hear that issue on Thursday.<br>The justices will also consider curtailing the issuing by federal judges of nationwide or universal injunctions. Mr. Miller has made the power of district judges to block Mr. Trump’s agenda a focal point. In March he declared that “our objective, one way or another, is to make clear that the district courts of this country do not have the authority to direct the functions of the executive branch.” <br>That position, which will be argued before the Nine by Solicitor General John Sauer, could prosper. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas have both expressed skepticism toward universal injunctions, and in 2022 Justice Elena Kagan reflected that “it just can’t be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through the normal process.”<br>If Mr. Miller is coordinating closely with the DOJ, that would appear to align with Mr. Trump’s desire to more tightly control the department that, under Attorney General Garland and Special Counsel Jack Smith, launched two criminal cases against him. During his first term, Mr. Trump was frustrated when his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from the Russia probe and appointed a special counsel. Even Mr. Session’s more accommodating replacement, William Barr, eventually quit under pressure after the 2020 election.<br>Ms. Bondi, who unlike Messrs. Barr and Garland did not go to an Ivy League college, is a former elected attorney general and, like Secretary Rubio, is a Floridian. She appears to be in lockstep with Mr. Trump and his West Wing advisers. When Ms. Bondi was sworn in she announced a “new DOJ” and vowed to make Mr. Trump “proud.”<br>Last month, America First Legal, the group Mr. Miller founded, filed a complaint against Attorney General Letitia James with the New York State Unified Court System’s Committee on Professional Standards. The complaint requests a state probe into allegations that Ms. James committed acts of mortgage fraud.<br>Ms. James is under criminal investigation by the justice department over the mortgage matter. Her broader conduct as an attorney general is also on the radar of Ms. Bondi’s Weaponization Working Group, which vows to probe “Federal cooperation with the weaponization by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, New York Attorney General Letitia James, their respective staffs, and other New York officials to target President Trump, his family, and his businesses.” <br>The new director of that group is Ed Martin, whose nomination for United States attorney for the District of Columbia the president recently withdrew. Mr. Martin is also taking over Ms. Oyer’s pardon duties.<br>A former DOJ official, Ed Whelan, a conservative, tells the Times, “I can’t recall an attorney general who seemed willing to be subordinate to White House staffers.” The office of the attorney general was created in 1789, and the DOJ dates to 1870. The Constitution vests all of the “executive power” in the president, meaning that he bears ultimate responsibility for the DOJ.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R75" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">76</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/14/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:5635px;left:-1px">TIẾT MỤC DIVIDEND CAFÉ CỦA THE BAHNSEN GROUP<br>Tóm tắt cho giới đầu tư, và câu hỏi đáp do Brian Szytel phụ trách:<br>----<br>Daily Recap - May 14, 2025<br>Dow: -89 (-0.21%)<br>S&amp;P: +0.10%<br>Nasdaq: +0.72%<br>2-Year Treasury Yield: 4.06% (+4 basis points)<br>10-Year Treasury Yield: 4.54% (+4 basis points)<br>Top-performing sector: Communication Services (+1.58%)<br>Bottom-performing sector: Health Care (-2.31%)<br>WTI Crude Oil: $62.85/barrel (-1.29%)<br>       * Fed Governor Waller said he would support more rate cuts and sooner if there were adverse effects on employment related to tariffs.<br>What&#39;s On Brian&#39;s Mind<br>A quiet day in markets to go along with a quiet day in the economic calendar.  That said, the S&amp;P closed modestly higher, the third day in a row, and is now up 18% from the low on 4/8/25, and slightly positive on the year.  A big rally in credit spreads in this recovery, the past few weeks, as well as high yield spreads coming sharply back to near record lows of just 300bps over Treasuries. <br>This market recovery in this short period has been one to behold.<br>Lately, there has been some resumption of animal spirits in AI-related names with reiterated CAPEX plans in the sector, and Trump’s visit to the Middle East to open advanced chip sales in the region.  The shift from the previous administration’s approach to offering advanced chips abroad based on qualitative factors to one that is country-specific and includes reciprocal investment back in the US is part of what has been driving the sector.  This has led to both the continued expansion in data center CAPEX and the need for power generation, fueling demand in the utility sector. <br>M&amp;A in the sector has also picked up with total deals this year alone already exceeding all last year combined.  The question isn’t going to be whether certain sectors can potentially benefit in this reciprocal trade environment (i.e., LNG exports) or certain sectors see potential policy headwinds (pharma), it&#39;s going to be whether the net effect adds to GDP and reduces deficits in the process.<br>For a fresh pulse on that end, tomorrow is one of the most action-packed economic data days I can remember.  We have the Empire and Philly Fed manufacturing, retail sales, PPI, initial jobless claims, industrial production, and potentially even a meeting between Putin and Zelensky to top it all off.  I’ll leave it here for the day, knowing there is plenty to unpack here tomorrow.<br>Ask TBG<br>  “I don’t own any Bitcoin, but now, with an exchange-traded fund available, do you think it makes sense for some percentage of a moderate investor&#39;s net worth from an asset allocation standpoint, say 2-5%?  The idea would be to diversify and add a safe haven asset and to hedge the risk of the US Dollar falling out of favor globally and fiat currency in general.  Thoughts?”~ D. R.<br>  I could elaborate a whole lot more on this subject, but here are a few main points I would make counter to what you would be after. <br>First, due to the hyper-volatile nature of Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies, the percentage of net worth most could tolerate would be just as you say, something in that sub-5% range. I am well aware of the super fans in the space swearing it should be much higher, and that is fine, I am just telling you pragmatically and from experience that most are not comfortable putting more than that amount of their nest egg in something that goes up and down more than 50% every few years to begin with.  <br>  That begs the question, even if it were to hedge against the demise of the dollar or fiat currency (which is debatable), how much would 5% do to offset the ill-fated outcome that would come of the other 95%?  Second, its historical record would be counter to it consistently performing like a safe haven asset to provide such a hedge to begin with.  When it declines as much or more during pure risk-off periods (March 2020, 2022, Q1 2025 and others), it defeats that purpose.  I understand the limited supply and decentralized use case for it.  I also understand the argument intellectually for a small percentage simply for the unknown correlation or diversification it may (or may not) provide.  I am just saying pragmatically, the volatility and correlation with other risk assets make it unrealistic as a safe haven.  If you want some skin in the game because it’s exciting and fascinating otherwise, then fine (so long as it’s in that small range of exposure).~ Brian T.

Somalis are flown in from 8,000 miles away - then they vacation in Somalia, you know, where they were allegedly being persecuted.<br>Trump could have accomplished the same thing - saving white South Africans from probable genocide - by offering refugee status only to immigrants who are unlikely ever to need government assistance. As luck would have it, that&#39;s already the law (8 USC 1182 (a)(4)(A)).<br>Or only to those who&#39;ve been fully vaccinated against mumps, measles, polio, etc., and, in light of the typical refugee, also against cholera, malaria, leprosy, yellow fever, typhoid fever, Ebola and other medieval diseases. <br>That, too, is already the law (8 USC 1182 (a)(1)(A)(ii)).<br>Or to no one who is a witch doctor, Santeria priest or voodoo practitioner. <br>(Again, already the law: 8 USC 1182 (a)(5)(B).)<br>These and many other provisions of federal immigration law have been entirely ignored for the past 50 years in order to bring in the poorest of the poor, who have no concept of Western civilization, preferably with wildly expensive medical problems and no means of support apart from criminal activity, who will require taxpayer support for the rest of their lives. <br>But their selling point is, they&#39;re not white.<br>The other night, CNN&#39;s Anderson Cooper and The New York Times&#39; Nicholas Kristof were in high dudgeon over Trump admitting English-speaking, non-welfare-receiving, Dutch-descended South Africans who are currently being threatened with dispossession and death by officials in their own government. <br>(The Economic Freedom Fighters - Motto: &quot;Kill the Boer!&quot; - with 10% to 15% of the vote, are insistent that land and businesses be confiscated from white owners and redistributed to Black South Africans. The New York Times reports that &quot;a large segment&quot; of the governing African National Congress agrees.) <br>First, let&#39;s review Kristof&#39;s expertise on refugees. He spent a decade promoting a total fraud, Somaly Mam, who claimed she&#39;d been beaten and prostituted as a child in Cambodia, sold to a brothel and tortured with electrodes. She wasn&#39;t white, so Mam became an instant celebrity, feted by Time magazine, Hillary Clinton, Sheryl Sandberg, Meg Ryan and Oprah.<br>Then it turned out her whole story was an elaborate Nigerian Prince scam, completely apocryphal from beginning to end, as was finally exposed by Newsweek magazine. So we should definitely listen to Kristof when it comes to humanitarian cases. <br>Anderson and Kristof&#39;s main argument is that there are millions of non-whites out there! Why can&#39;t we get them instead of being saddled with 59 tall, healthy, educated, English-speaking South Africans? It&#39;s hard to argue with that.<br>On the other hand, their beloved Afghans, who &quot;saved the lives of American troops,&quot; according to both Cooper and Kristof (Cooper heard it from Jussie Smollett, and Kristof heard it from Somaly Mam), prefer to live under sharia law.<br>In case you&#39;re unfamiliar with the Taliban, their version of sharia prohibits women from leaving their homes without a male relative, forces them to wear head-to-toe burqas, and still employs stonings, public hangings and amputations as criminal punishments. <br>To each his own, but wouldn&#39;t the 99% of Afghans who told Pew they want to live that way be happier in one of the 35 countries that practice sharia law? <br>Cooper was especially incensed that we&#39;re not bringing Sudanese and Congolese people to our shores, testily adding, &quot;On this program, we reported on the violence, the plight of people there in a series of programs in 2006.&quot; (Don&#39;t worry if you missed it, nothing&#39;s changed.) <br>Those countries have been beset by bloody civil wars, involving mass rape and millions dead. WHY CAN&#39;T WE HAVE THAT IN OUR COUNTRY??? Not only that, but Congo has been &quot;fighting for decades.&quot; What&#39;s not to like?<br>Cooper seems to think Congolese people merely need to be moved to a majority white country, like the U.S., in order to bring stability and safety to their lives. It&#39;s like busing on an international scale. <br>Unfortunately, the idea of the Great White Father died out with European colonialism. If the mightiest empires in the world could spend decades imposing Western values, the rule of law, modern medicine, engineering and farming techniques on these countries only to have them - immediately, the moment the imperial power leaves - erupt into bloody, violent, corrupt, cannibalistic dystopias, then bringing them here to collect welfare probably isn&#39;t going to help either.<br>By 1968, British historian Paul Johnson reported, the dozens of decolonized African nations had already experienced 64 military coups. Less than a decade later, 20 of the 41 independent African countries were ruled by military juntas and the rest were dominated by coups, wars, uprisings, massacres, starvation and sadistic rulers. None were democracies.<br>(Speaking of Congo, when Belgium withdrew in 1960, it had a booming industrial base, the highest literacy rate and most hospital beds in Africa. Five days after Independence Day, the Congolese military erupted in an ecstasy of violence, looting, killing and raping whites.) <br>Importing the third world doesn&#39;t turn third-worlders into us, it turns us into the third world. One of our beloved African refugees was Beatrice Munyenyezi, a victim of the Rwandan genocide that former U.N. ambassador Samantha Power desperately tried to get us involved in. Then it turned out that Munyenyezi was a perpetrator, not a victim of the genocide. (Once again: I’m totally impressed with our immigration officials.) <br>And remember that nice pharmacist lady we brought in from Pakistan after she married an American? Within two years, Tashfeen Malik and her &quot;American-born&quot; husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, had committed mass murder in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 and injuring 22. According to the GAO, in the decade after 9/11, a majority of those convicted of terrorism offenses in the U.S. immigrated here legally. American police say they are being asked to respect Mexican rape culture when 13-year-old Hispanic girls are impregnated by 40-year-old men. One detective said he&#39;ll show up at the house of the girl, expecting the family to be in a blind rage, only to be told &quot;it’s a blessing and we’re so happy. I’ll explain it’s illegal, they cut me right off. I get a lot of those too.” <br>Cooper and Kristof’s other killer argument against the South African refugees is that they have... white privilege! Please apologize now.<br>&quot;These Afrikaners,&quot; Kristof said, &quot;are among the most privileged people on the entire continent,&quot; adding that they have &quot;assets 20 times greater than those of black South Africans on average.&quot; So what? Does having assets mean the government isn&#39;t trying to kill you? Jews had more assets in Germany. Kulaks had more assets in Russia. Or is Kristof suggesting it&#39;s OK to persecute people with assets? That would be bad news because you know where else whites have more assets than blacks? </div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R77" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">78</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/14/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:2157px;left:-1px">TIẾT MỤC TUYỆT DIỆU CỦA THE FREE PRESS<br>Cùng một biến cố (bài diễn văn hôm Thứ Ba 13/5 của Donald Trump tại Riyadh) tờ báo giới thiệu bình luận của Batya Ungar-Sargon rồi của Eli Lake nhận định từ hai giác độ khác nhau.

Sensibly approach this issue, to show that it’s not us that is slowing down the process.”<br>Zelensky had urged Trump to join talks in Turkey, but the U.S. president, who is on a tour of the Middle East, said at the moment he was unavailable. “Now tomorrow, we’re all booked out,” he told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday. “Now that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t do it to save a lot of lives and come back.”<br>Zelensky has said he will meet only with Putin, not with any lower-level Russian officials.<br>After claiming he could end the three-year conflict in one day, Trump is nearly four months into his second administration with little to show for the diplomatic effort he started. In recent days, Trump has told aides he would consider getting Russia and Ukraine to talk directly and seriously - a win on its own, allowing the U.S. to pull back from the negotiations and focus on other priorities.<br>Trump has similarly launched quick-fire, high-stakes diplomatic initiatives, including nuclear talks with Iran, trade negotiations with China, a truce with Houthi rebels and cease-fire and hostage-release negotiations between Israel and Hamas, with whom the U.S. separately arranged the release of the last American hostage in Gaza.<br>Elsewhere, European Union officials approved a 17th round of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday, this time targeting some 200 ships that are deemed part of Moscow’s “shadow fleet” that transports illicit oil.

(and beyond), providing the inside track on both the overhyped and overlooked events of the week.)<br>Green New Deal Rollback<br>House Republicans on Tuesday marked up final pieces of their reconciliation bill, and there’s enough material to keep policy wonks and lobbyists busy for weeks. Free marketers are finding items to both cheer and boo, and the WSJ editorial page goes through lowlights and highlights here, here and here. The big takeaway - the GOP pulled its punches in a lot of policy areas to mollify moderates and Donald Trump populists.<br>But one area where the GOP looks to have been a bit more aggressive was in rolling back Joe Biden’s Green New Deal. Biden threw hundreds of billions at the left’s climate hysteria - while imposing crushing new mandates - and then directed his administration to use its final days in office to shovel as much of of the money out the door as possible. But many programs and provisions remain fair game, and the GOP is going after some of the biggies. A rundown:<br>* The numbers: House Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie (R., Ky.) wrote that his committee’s bill will claw back $6.5 billion in unspent funds from Biden’s misnamed Inflation Reduction Act. Ways and Means is also cutting some “clean credits,” a move that on paper reduces spending by more than $500 billion, but comes with important caveats (see below).<br>* Electric Vehicles: The Ways and Means bill phases out and terminates the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles, the $4,000 tax credit for used EVs, and a commercial EV credit. The last two will terminate at the end of this year. The tax credit for new private EV purchases ostensibly continues through 2026, though Congress is reinstating the 200,000 cap on the number of consumer vehicles per manufacturer that qualify for the credit - which most carmakers have already hit. These provisions alone will save taxpayers about $190 billion.<br>* Housing tax credits: Ways and Means would repeal at the end of this year tax credits for homeowners who make energy-efficient improvements or buy “clean energy” equipment for their homes, as well as credits for contractors that build energy-efficient homes.<br>* Grants, subsidies and loans: The Energy Committee bill pulls back money from the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, the politicized $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, “environmental justice grants,” various Inflation Reduction Act subsidy programs for renewables and electrification, and a grab bag of others handouts. It even takes aim at some spending outside the Inflation Reduction Act, cutting more than $400 million, for instance, from the Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.<br>* Tailpipe emissions: One of the best parts of the Energy Committee’s bill is its killing of the Biden EPA “tailpipe emissions” standards, finalized last year, which was a de facto federal mandate for EVs that would have eliminated gasoline-powered vehicles. That mandate was also costly for the federal government, as it turbocharged the EV tax credit and reduced federal gasoline-tax revenue. The bill similarly repeals Biden’s corporate average fuel standards for model years 2027 and later.<br>* Disappointments: Republicans bragged they were ending “special interest giveaways” - which is spin. The Ways and Means bill phases out certain production tax credits and investment tax credits for wind, solar and other renewables - but the phaseouts don’t begin until 2029 - when there could be a Democratic president. Ditto other energy giveaways. This looks more like the usual budget gimmick: promise a phaseout or termination down the road, then provide a reprieve. The legislation does at least end transferability - a feature of the Inflation Reduction Act - which allowed project sponsors to sell credits, and also includes some new restrictions on the ability of certain “foreign influenced entities” to receive them.<br>Trump campaigned on much of this, including the end of taxpayer support for EVs, noting that the Green New Deal agenda was punishing automakers, industry and consumer choice. Some Republicans are still begging to keep the taxpayer handouts rolling to their districts, and the liberal media is wailing about the death of “clean energy.” The rollback is instead an admission that this federal gusher of subsidies is highly distortionary to markets, has hiked prices, and is standing in the way of Donald Trump’s more broad-based energy agenda. Here’s to hoping the provisions survive the Senate process.<br>CONGRESS&#39;S LIBRARY OF AGENCY CONFUSION<br>[Quá hay vì ít ai biết!]<br>Democrats and the media are in an uproar over Trump’s abrupt firing of Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer complaining that the president is treating “federal appointments like reality TV prizes.” Yet the mess is best laid in Congress’s lap, and just the latest in a broader debate about the role and power of Washington agencies.<br>The Trump team notified Hayden of her termination last Thursday, though her 10-year term wasn’t due to end until next year. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt in Friday’s press briefing said the administration “felt she did not fit the needs of the American people.” Trump has since appointed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as acting librarian, and Democrats are demanding legislation that would give a congressional commission the power to appoint the librarian - stripping that authority from the president.<br>Yet Congress might have done that any time up to now. The Library of Congress is what many call a “legislative agency,” which mostly exists to assist Congress in carrying out its duties. Other legislative agencies include the Government Accountability Office, the Government Publishing office, and the Architect of the Capitol. These entities are different from executive branch departments and from the “independent” agencies Congress created to perform executive functions (for instance the National Labor Relations Board or the Federal Election Commission). It was Thomas Jefferson who signed legislation in 1802 giving the president the power to appoint the Librarian of Congress (subject to Senate confirmation), a model that has governed the choosing of leadership for some legislative agencies ever since.<br>Only in recent years has Congress moved to give itself authority to make more of these appointments. In 2022, a former architect of the Capitol, J. Brett Blanton, refused to resign even after an inspector general report found he had abused his office; Biden fired him. Congress then changed the law to give a congressional commission sole power to appoint or remove the architect - though it notably didn’t extend that power to other agencies. Which meant Congress left the door wide open for Trump to fire the librarian. This fight meanwhile occurs alongside a separate legal brawl over who in Washington governs “independent” agencies. Maybe by the end, Congress and the White House - after 248 years - will know who is actually in charge of what?<br>RIGHTSIZING FEDERAL BENEFITS<br>Another overlooked piece of the GOP reconciliation bill: a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee overhaul of the federal pension system, an overdue effort to bring a pinch of reality to the government’s generous pension system, and one that will save federal taxpayers close to $50 billion over the next 10 years.<br>A little-known fact: Most of the federal government’s nearly three million civil employees receive a straight-up pension that, for a significant number, is collected in addition to Social Security benefits. The feds spend more than $90 billion a year just on these pension benefits. The committee changes would ask most employees to contribute 4.4% annually to their own pensions; right now, only newer hires contribute at that level. Employees will be expected to contribute at higher rates still if they refuse to become “at will” employees (losing some union protections against termination). The reform would also tweak the formula for determining retirement benefits and eliminate a special perk most federal retirees get if they retire before they turn 62 (a monetary payout that lasts until Social Security kicks in).<br>Private-sector workers won’t consider most of these changes over the top, as few of them receive a guaranteed pension or special worker protections in the first place. Benefits for federal workers per hour cost far more than benefits for private-sector workers.<br>Federal unions are livid about the alterations, and at least one Republican, Ohio’s Mike Turner, voted against the reform when the committee passed its portion of the reconciliation bill. No word yet on whether Turner considers the changes a deal-killer in any final House vote, but the dispute is a reminder of just how many issues remain at play in a final House vote - one in which Speaker Mike Johnson can’t afford to lose more than three members of his Republican team.<br>By the Numbers (Ways &amp; Means Edition):<br>[5] Billions of dollars the House Ways and Means reconciliation bill proposes to spend annually on a new tax credit for donations to a first ever federal school-choice scholarship program.<br>[10] Thousands of dollars Americans would be able to deduct from their federal taxes in interest on car loans under the bill.

The bill also increases the maximum penalty for the unauthorized disclosure of taxpayers information to $250,000, up from $5,000 now, and clarifies that a separate violation occurs for each taxpayers’ information that is released (to avoid a repeat of the Charles Littlejohn travesty).<br>State of the States<br>Florida is these days considered a vanguard of conservative reform, with transplants flocking to its shores and generally rewarding Republican governance. How’s that new mix of voters looking at issues today? The James Madison Institute publishes an intriguing statewide poll, which includes the following interesting findings: Floridians are (relatively) down on property taxes, up on multichild families, very worried by the costs of tariffs, and in search of dentists. </div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R80" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">81</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/14/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:5730px;left:-1px">TRUMP BỊ ERDOGAN CHO HÚP MẬT NÊN TỐI MẮT!<br>Khi Syria đổi chủ, lãnh tụ Bashar al Assad chạy qua Nga hôm mùng tám Tháng 12 năm ngoái và al-Sharaa lên thay, ai cũng thấy bàn tay của ‘người hùng’ Erdogan, một thần tượng khác của Trump! <br>Nay thì hiểu tại sao Turkey lại làm môi giới cho việc ‘đàm phán’ về Ukraine....<br>https://thespectator.com/.../donald-trump-met-syria.../<br>Why Trump met Syria’s interim president<br>Ahmed al-Sharaa is the former al-Qaeda and ISIS firebrand turned interim leader of Syria<br>(Owen Matthews - The Spectator - Wednesday, May 14, 2025)<br>al-sharaa<br>President Donald Trump meets with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa along with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman al-Saud in Riyadh (Getty)<br>Few career arcs in modern history can be as remarkable as that of Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa – or Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, to give him the nom de guerre under which he fought American troops in Iraq back when he was a firebrand member of al-Qaeda. Twenty years ago al-Sharaa was languishing in a US military prison in Baghdad, held on suspicion of terrorism. Today, as Syria’s new interim President, he shook hands with Donald Trump posing for photo-calls alongside the de-facto ruler of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman.<br>Trump was evidently impressed by al-Sharaa, who has swapped the turban and dusty fatigues that he habitually wore before taking Damascus by storm last winter for a plain blue suit and purple tie. “He’s a young attractive guy. Strong past, very strong past – fighter,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after the meeting in Riyadh. “He’s got a real shot at holding [Syria] together… It’s a torn-up country.”<br>Between the US-led invasion of Iraq in April 2003 and its withdrawal two decades later, some 4,300 American troops were killed by Iraqi insurgents and foreign volunteer fighters like al-Sharaa – along with between 112,000 to 210,000 civilians. As the chaos in Iraq wound down in 2011 al-Sharaa was released after a five-year stint in an American-run prison camp and returned to Syria, where he had grown up and attended two years of medical school before joining the jihad. But his career as a pyrotechnician of civil war and mayhem was just getting started as the Arab Spring insurgency against the Assad regime kicked off with a nationwide uprising. Al-Sharaa – very much neither reformed nor chastened by his time in US custody – traveled to Damascus with bags full of cash as the lieutenant of Islamic State founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. His mission was to found the Syrian branch of ISIS, squeeze out the moderate anti-Assad opposition and turn the resistance into a jihad. <br>Al-Sharaa, it seems, is a hard man to kill. He survived multiple air raids by the US, British and Russian forces, backed by occasional covert special forces operations. Breaking away from ISIS, he became the Emir of the al-Nusra Front and later created another al-Qaeda splinter group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. After the destruction of the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in 2017, HTS fighters created a mini-state on a pocket of land in Idlib province near the Turkish border. And in the kaleidoscope of shifting factional politics, HTS also found a new protector in the form of the Turkish military. And it was with the backing of Turkey’s strongman President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that al-Sharaa led his fighters in a surprise assault first on Aleppo and then Damascus last year. Assad’s forces, and his regime, collapsed like a house of cards.<br>Today al-Sharaa is trying to project a new image – not as a jihadi terrorist but a tolerant leader of a multinational, multi-confessional Syria. “In the future Syria, we believe that diversity is our strength, not a weakness,” read one of Jolani/al-Sharaa’s early edicts on taking control of Aleppo in December 2024. His fighters swapped the black banner of the al-Nusra Front for the old flag of the Syrian Republic that dated back to before the 1963 Baath party revolution that brought the Assads to power. Nonetheless, HTS remained on the US terror list – and al-Sharaa personally had a $10 million bounty on his head until it was quietly removed in the first weeks of his de-facto leadership of Syria.<br>Is it appalling cynicism or sensible pragmatism for Trump to shake a hand that is figuratively, and possibly literally, stained with Americans’ blood? History is full of examples of respectable world leaders doing deals with the twentieth century’s most notorious devils. Nixon and Mao met on cordial diplomatic terms, as did Churchill and Stalin, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and the Emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa, Yizhak Rabin and Yassir Arafat. Even Britain’s long-suffering late Majesty the Queen was obliged by various of her prime ministers to extend full state welcome to both Bashir-al Assad and Vladimir Putin – as well as to shake hands with former IRA terrorist Martin McGuinness. <br>Trump is undoubtedly taking his lead from Erdoğan, who sponsored al-Sharaa’s power grab and who is clearly banking on his protegé to bring a semblance of stability to war-ravaged Syria. “I spoke with President Erdoğan, who is very friendly with [al-Sharaa],” Trump told the press. Erdoğan “feels he’s got a shot of doing a good job.” <br>Indeed the context of the Riyadh meeting was to push through a rapprochement between Damascus and Jerusalem that is part of a long-term Saudi strategy to isolate its arch-nemesis, Iran, and cut off its regional tries to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Trump, the Saudis, the Turks and the Israelis are all pushing al-Sharaa to sign the Abraham Accords – a US-led initiative which aims to normalize relations between Israel and Arab nations. Part of that deal will be to force “all foreign terrorists to leave Syria,” according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Which is of course ironic as those foreign terrorists – including the murderous British fanatics known as the Beatles who cold-bloodedly murdered US and British hostages – were until recently al-Sharaa’s comrades-in-arms in ISIS. <br>Peace makes for strange bedfellows – and nowhere more so than in the Middle East. Al-Sharaa’s claims to have been reborn as a tolerant democratic leader were shaken in March by a series of massacres of up to 1,500 Alawites, a heterodox brand of Shiite Islam followed by the now-exiled Assad family. Al-Sharaa condemned the violence and blamed it on pro-Assad groups. “We won’t accept that any blood be shed unjustly, or goes without punishment or accountability, even among those closest to us,” he said.  <br>Trump was shaking hands with a future peaceful leader of a post-war Syria, rather than the former terrorist and possible murderer of Americans. Or to put it another way, he put political pragmatism before gesture politics. Perhaps some time soon he will do the same with Vladimir Putin.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 282px"><th id="0R81" style="height: 282px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 282px">82</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">5/14/25</td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:6314px;left:-1px">ĐỌC BÀI NÀY HIỂU NGAY NÃO TRẠNG CỦA TRUMP<br>Thì Canada cũng như Hawaii, sẽ là một tiểu bang của Mỹ.

But he is still upending global trade. Trump has established baseline ten percent tariffs on most imports. He has made those levies higher for a variety of specific goods, including steel. And he slapped 145 percent tariffs on imports from China, the world’s largest manufacturer, although he has now agreed to cut this rate to 30 percent. The result has been a raft of trade wars between Washington and other governments, Beijing foremost among them.<br>Trump’s disruptions to the global economy are serious, and they may feel novel. But today’s situation is hardly without precedent. One does not have to look especially far back to see what the president’s tariffs might do to the world. The problems the global economy now faces echo some that existed before the 1995 creation of the World Trade Organization and others that existed even before the WTO’s predecessor, the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Until those bodies helped standardize commerce, countries frequently used trade to extract concessions from one another. They created and exploited what economists call “hold-up problems”: when one state or firm makes an investment in another in which profits depend on the continuation of the relationship. For example, one country could build oil infrastructure in another country that the supplier alone can service or operate. Once such deals are concluded, powerful countries can coerce their partners simply by threatening to change the terms of the agreement.<br>In the near term, countries can benefit from wielding trade as a cudgel. But in the long term, trade wars leave almost everyone worse off. When countries frequently use economic leverage to secure concessions from vulnerable partners, investment and economic growth go down. Political instability, meanwhile, goes up. States that chafe at economic coercion sometimes turn to their militaries in order to fight back. Countries that once cooperated because of commercial ties turn into competitors. Even close allies drift apart. Trump may think his tariff regime will make the United States richer, safer, and stronger. But history suggests it will do just the opposite.<br>PAIN WITHOUT GAIN<br>In the early nineteenth century, American traders began doing business with U.S. settlers in the kingdom of Hawaii. At the time, the islands’ economy revolved around sugar plantations, many of which were owned or controlled by American businessmen who exported sugar to the U.S. market. Eventually, to help the sugar farmers, the two countries struck the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, which eliminated tariffs on Hawaiian sugar entering the United States. In response, Hawaii’s sugar economy boomed.<br>Initially, this deal worked reasonably well for Hawaii, which grew much richer from the exports. But it made the kingdom ever more dependent on the United States, which was able to exploit this reliance to its advantage. Washington refused, for example, to renew the Reciprocity Treaty unless Hawaii gave it exclusive rights to Pearl Harbor. American officials then eliminated tariffs on all foreign sugar in the 1890s and gave domestic producers a subsidy to shield the U.S. industry from foreign competition and keep prices low. This deprived Hawaii of its cost advantage. Hawaiian planters were crushed, increasing support among the islands’ U.S. elite for annexation. The elite’s push was successful, despite overwhelming opposition by the native Hawaiian population.<br>Hawaii was hardly the only country victimized by trade dependence. The United States and European countries had their investments in railroads, mines, and oil infrastructure in Mexico after Mexico expropriated them both outright and through regulator changes. Their banks and railways in China were attacked by the Qing dynasty. Western investments in Cuba were sabotaged under Spanish colonial rule. Perhaps most famously, Germany used its status as one of the largest importers of eastern European agriculture to gain political influence in that region before World War II.<br>These risks, in turn, suppressed overall economic exchange. No countries wanted to be conquered or coerced, so many of them steered clear of international commerce. The founders of the United States feared that economic dependence on the United Kingdom would give London undue influence even after they won the Revolutionary War, so they curtailed transatlantic trade. Qing China feared that trade dependence was a security vulnerability and likewise held back from global markets. Imperial Russia embraced autarky in the late nineteenth century to avoid vulnerability. In the 1930s, Japan went so far as to seize Manchuria in order to create an autarkic bloc that would supply Tokyo with raw materials without having to negotiate with the West.<br>In this rough-and-tumble era, trade wars were frequent and destabilizing. Sometimes, they helped produce outright conflict. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which raised U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 goods, prompted a global trade war that intensified geopolitical rivalries and helped push Germany, Italy, and Japan toward autarky and expansionism. Most famously, after the United States placed tariffs, embargoes, and export controls on Japanese oil, scrap metal, and aviation fuel, Tokyo struck Pearl Harbor in 1941. Trade tensions have featured in many other military conflicts, as well. Trade pressure and maritime coercion, for example, also helped lead to the War of 1812.<br>There still were bright moments for trade in the pre-WTO era, especially after World War II ended. In 1979, for instance, China and the United States normalized ties, and in 1980, the latter country granted the former permanent normal trade relations - preferential tariff treatment under U.S. law. But for two decades, the U.S. Congress had to vote yearly to renew China’s normal trade status, which legislators conditioned on Beijing making human rights and nonproliferation concessions. Although Congress always granted this status, the recurring uncertainty depressed trade and investment, as firms hesitated to engage deeply with a partner whose access to the American market could be revoked at any time. Economic actors, after all, require stable, predictable frameworks to make long-term investments.<br>In response, Beijing pushed to join the WTO from the moment it was created, hoping the body could guarantee Chinese manufacturers predictable global access. This effort sparked fierce debate within the United States about whether to permit accession. Advocates of integration argued that tying China’s economy to the world’s would deter China from launching military conflicts, lest it risk a cutoff, and encourage political liberalization. Opponents feared that economic integration before political liberalization would only strengthen an authoritarian competitor. Ultimately, the optimists prevailed: Washington allowed Beijing to join the WTO in 2001. The organization then alleviated China’s hold-up problems by prohibiting the United States from threatening tariff hikes each year. The Chinese economy, already expanding at a healthy rate, began to grow even faster.<br>For the WTO, Chinese accession was a triumph. The organization was created to increase trade everywhere and stop countries from using commerce as a weapon, and integrating the world’s most populous country (and a former U.S. adversary) suggested the body was having its intended effect. And at the time, it was - countries typically obeyed the WTO’s common rules, listened to its adjudicators, and played along with its enforcement tribunals. The resulting system was hardly perfect; it failed, for example, to stop China from using industrial policy as a means to promote specific sectors or companies, often at the expense of foreign firms, or from restricting exports to countries that criticized Beijing. But for the most part, the WTO was quite successful. Trade flourished, and the global economy grew more quickly than it otherwise would have.<br>BACK TO THE FUTURE<br>Then came the 2016 election of Trump. The president, always a critic of free trade, quickly went about abandoning and dismantling the WTO framework - taking opposition to the body to a whole new level. The United States, once the organization’s biggest champion, largely stopped listening to WTO guidance. It adopted trade practices that outright violated the body’s rules. And it paralyzed the organization’s appellate body in order to further weaken the system. Instead, Washington’s leaders reembraced a transactional view of trade, deploying tariffs as blunt instruments of punishment and coercion. Hold-up problems, once thought tamed, returned with a vengeance. Long-term investment and cross-border economic planning became riskier as geopolitical considerations reasserted themselves.<br>During Trump’s first term, these policies helped spur a more defensive posture by the United States’ trade partners. The EU, for example, devised new geoeconomic policies such as its anti-coercion instrument, which allows the bloc to respond to economic coercion by imposing tariffs, restricting access to EU markets, or suspending international obligations. China and the United States began to separate out investments. Such actions may well have suppressed both trade and foreign direct investment, although the declines in both are difficult to disentangle from the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. But even if Trump’s policies mattered little the first time around, that does not mean they will have trivial effects now. The first Trump administration featured many advisers who prevented the president from unleashing the kind of broad-based tariffs that he has implemented in 2025. Today, firms face even greater uncertainty. As a result, Chinese companies are already intensifying efforts to eliminate foreign components from their supply chains. So is the EU.<br>Trump’s tariffs are unlikely to help the U.S. economy. They will probably fail at their main stated goal - bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States - because businesses will be reluctant to invest more at home when Washington keeps making and breaking trade agreements. The White House, after all, could instantly render whatever domestic factories companies build unprofitable by slashing tariffs. Trump also wants to use the leverage from the tariffs to compel countries to sign bilateral agreements with the United States, as was common before the advent of the multilateral trading system, but these deals will not do much to encourage investment, either. Unlike in a multilateral system, bilateral agreements are difficult to enforce and thus difficult for countries and firms to trust. In a bilateral system, trading partners also constantly worry that whatever agreement they sign with the United States will be undercut by a new deal between Washington and a different government. The result is even more uncertainty and thus less investment.<br>Trump’s trade war, in other words, will likely have similar economic effects as trade wars past. It could also have similar political consequences. Alliances may fray as countries look to hedge their bets, diversifying economic ties rather than simply trusting their partners. Governments will use tariffs to try to weaken competitors. Trump has already apparently used tariffs in an effort to annex Canada (in a strange redux of U.S. policy toward Hawaii), saying that Canada could avoid tariffs by becoming an American state and threatening “economic force” if it doesn’t. In response, Canadians have pivoted away from the United States, including by boycotting U.S. products. So have people in other countries; for example, overall favorability ratings of the United States have fallen across Western Europe since Trump won.<br>The United States is unlikely to attack any of these countries outright, although Trump has threatened Danish-controlled Greenland. But by reducing mutual dependency, his tariffs do lower the costs of military confrontation. If the United States reduces its economic reliance on Taiwanese semiconductors, for instance, Beijing might decide that Washington won’t respond if China blockades or invades the island. Conversely, in a more transactional world, countries could use whatever dependencies still exist to gain a political advantage - as Berlin did with agriculture in the 1930s. Russia, in particular, has long used such tactics by manipulating the price of oil and gas to extract political concessions from countries in its periphery, contributing to regional conflict.<br>Moscow’s tactics have naturally led many nearby states to diversify away from Russia. Now, similar tactics are also costing the United States. But should Washington lose its economic credibility, the result could be far more destabilizing than is the case for countries that do not trust the Kremlin. Washington’s ability to stand by its agreements has been the backbone of many essential global institutions, including NATO. It is a key reason the dollar is the world’s reserve currency. Without reliable frameworks, international politics will become more uncertain and volatile, making miscalculation and conflict more likely. The situation could start to resemble the lead-up to World War II, which partially resulted from the collapse of the League of Nations and the failure of European powers to nip German expansionism in the bud.<br>Trump may ultimately reduce some of his levies, particularly as he negotiates with more and more countries. He has already made a trade deal with the United Kingdom. But the president has abandoned the institutions and norms that once stabilized global trade.

This chart shows the evolution of President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods since taking office. The new 30% rate is much lower than 145%, but still considerably higher than it was in January. <br>Source: Dario Perkins <br>[Coi đồ biểu của Dario Perkins thấy Trump làm bộ nói thách!]<br>Additional 25% tariffs apply to some goods like steel, aluminum, and automotive parts. It is not clear as we write whether these will be stacked on top of the 30% general tariff. But in any case, even 30% rates are still enough to reduce business profits and/or raise consumer prices. The bigger problem is we still don’t know where this is going. [Thế mới thảm!]<br>A 90-day pause doesn’t give businesses the long-term stability they need to make growth plans. It also leaves enough inflation pressure to probably keep the Fed from cutting rates until late this year, at the soonest. <br>2/ DC HOMES<br>Washingtion, DC, has been called a “company town,” the company being the federal government which DOGE is trying to downsize. This may already be having local economic effects. The chart shows annual change in home sale listings in the Washington metro area. The latest data shows listings growing at the fastest pace since 2015. <br>Source: Liz Ann Sonders [số nhà rao bán tại thủ đô tăng vọt từ giữa năm 2023, rồi sau ba tháng đầu năm nay lại tăng nữa!]<br>However, this is a volatile data series with wild swings even before the COVID era. The current uptrend dates back to mid-2023, so it’s not clear how much DOGE has to do with this. Whatever the reason, anyone who is house hunting in the DC area will have more choices than they did a few years ago. <br>3/ A TRILLION HERE, A TRILLION THERE<br>President Trump’s 2026 budget proposal requests $1.0 trillion for defense spending. This chart places that number in historical context, showing the Pentagon’s annual budget, adjusted for inflation. <br>Source: Stephen Semler <br>A $1 trillion+ defense budget, if approved, will be comparable to the amounts spent during World War II or the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. This also matters economically. More than half the defense budget goes to private contractors, mainly US companies. This flows into the economy as both profits and payroll. Higher defense spending may or may not enhance national defense but will certainly have a stimulative effect on the economy. It will also raise the national debt unless offset by other spending cuts. <br>[Ngân sách quốc phòng ngàn tỷ, cao bằng thời chiến, mà cũng tạo ra số cầu về sản xuất nội địa - và số tiền đi vay!]<br>4/ WAGE GROWTH, SOMETIMES<br>Here’s a long-term look at US median wage growth adjusted for PCE inflation. Ernie Tedeschi of Yale’s Budget Lab, who made the chart, added this comment: “I look at this graph and I see real wages that are 1) up over the long-run, 2) most responsive to tight labor markets, 3) susceptible to periods of stagnation, sometimes extended periods.” <br>Source: Ernie Tedeschi <br>To his first point, mid-tier worker real income roughly doubled in six decades. This indicates productivity rose faster than inflation. The fastest wage growth occurred in periods of high GDP growth and/or labor force constraints. In the 1960s, for example, most of the Baby Boom generation was still below working age, women faced significant barriers, and many men were in the military. Civilian wages rose accordingly. <br>Yet there are also periods of stagnation, highlighted in the pink boxes we added. The longest occurred in the 1970s and early 1980s, a period of high inflation. The last one was during the 2008 recession. Wage growth has been solid since then - perhaps due to demographic constraints. That part of the line resembles the 1960s portion. Let’s hope it doesn’t end the same way. <br>5/ A BIGGER FLORIDA<br>The green area shows Florida’s coastline during the last ice age, when much of the ocean was locked up in polar ice caps and glaciers. Since people tend to live near water, that now-inundated coastal area probably contained early human settlements. What was their economy like?

In its announcement that it will nullify the election of David Hogg and another Vice Chair, the DNC reminded the public why they have left the Democratic Party. The sudden decision that there were procedural irregularities in the election (after Hogg said that he would target older Democratic incumbents) leaves the DNC looking more like the CCP. However, it gets worse.<br>Hogg caused a controversy by announcing that he will work to primary older Democratic incumbents through his group, Leaders We Deserve, to bring young candidates into the party. The leadership ordered him to retract the pledge or resign. He did neither.<br>Then, the DNC announced that there were “irregularities” in how he and Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta won two of the three vice chair positions.<br>The reason? One of the losing candidates, Kalyn Free, filed a complaint during the original election alleging that the DNC failed to follow rules on gender diversity.<br>If you recall, the Democratic Party was widely mocked over the difficulty of the DNC leadership to explain its convoluted rules for guaranteeing gender and racial diversity. It became a parody of itself.<br>This is just one of the efforts to explain the rules:<br>Jamie Harrison eventually had to turn it over to another DNC member who had equal difficulty explaining the gender equality rules and procedures:<br>    HARRISON: “Because of our gender balance provisions on this next ballot, you will be able to vote for two candidates of any gender on the next ballot. OK? So on this next ballot, you will be able to vote for two candidates of any gender on the next<br>    ballot. If two candidates receive — I’m going to turn to Helen to clarify this last part.”<br>    UNKNOWN FEMALE: “You are in this next ballot where you have two votes. As the chair has said, you may vote for two males, two females, two of any gender. OK? No, you can’t do that. Because we’ve got to balance. You could vote for one of any gender, OK? Non-binary gender. Excuse me. It is late. OK?”<br>After she lost, Free filed her complaint. It would have been an easy matter to determine if there was an invalid balloting but the DNC moved on…for months.<br>After Hogg refused to recant or resign, the DNC then issued this procedural excuse to negate the election.<br>For many, the exercise seemed yet another manipulation by the DNC after it refused to have a real debate over the nomination of Kamala Harris and simply held a coronation at the convention after she failed to secure a single primary vote. Despite spending over $1.2 billion, she lost to Trump.<br>DNC members rushed forward to insist that this was just a coincidence and had nothing to do with Hogg’s controversy.<br>However, they then contradicted that claim in comments to the media as Hogg himself said that it was about his campaign to bring in young voters.<br>One former official told the media, “This is not about David Hogg, despite what he’s saying. It is gender balance…. It’s in the rules that the officers need to be balanced between men and women.” However, the same official then added “The full DNC now gets to vote again. If they like what Hogg is doing then that’s great, and he’ll be re-elected. It was disingenuous to not reveal his intentions the first time before they voted. While it has nothing to do with him, it’s an elected position so now we’ll find out if the party supports it or not, which they very well may.”<br>Another former official insisted that the vote was needed because “either Hogg is wrong and misled members or they think he’s doing the right thing. Either way, it’ll be settled. And he can’t complain. A re-vote is not forcing him out, there are other ways to do that if they chose to.”<br>I grew up in a liberal Democratic family in Chicago and spent much of my life working for Democratic politicians. It has been astonishing to watch the current Democratic leadership destroy their own party with identity politics and radical agendas.<br>Yet, this takes the cake.

It was a declaration of deterrence.<br>From their perch at Jiupeng military base [Căn cứ Cửu Phong]- where steep green ridges descend toward the Pacific - Taiwanese forces fired the U.S.-made rocket artillery system in a live-fire display designed to show how the island is transforming itself into a fortress of modern asymmetric warfare. The Taiwanese unit conducting the test had trained with U.S. forces in Oklahoma in 2024, and this week’s exercise marked the first time they demonstrated their proficiency with HIMARS on home soil.<br>The HIMARS platform - demonstrated in footage provided to The Bureau from Taiwan Plus - signals a decisive shift toward a mobile, nimble defensive force designed to face overwhelming scale. Unlike fixed missile sites or air bases - prime targets expected to be destroyed within hours of a PLA first-wave assault - truck-mounted HIMARS units can slip into position, launch a strike, and quickly vanish into Taiwan’s jungle-thick terrain and cliffside roads. These launchers are meant to hide, hit, and move - relying on camouflage, speed, and the natural topography of the island to stay alive and strike again.<br>This transformation had been quietly underway for years. In September 2023, The Bureau met with Taiwanese military strategists and international journalists at a closed-door roundtable in Taipei. Among them was a Ukrainian defense consultant - invited to share hard-won battlefield lessons from Kyiv’s resistance. The strategist told the group that the most crucial lesson for Taiwan was psychological: to instill in citizens and soldiers alike the will to prepare for aggression that seems impossible and illogical, before it arrives. “You must believe the worst can happen,” the Ukraine vet said.<br>That same week in Taipei, Taiwan’s then-Foreign Minister Joseph Wu made the case directly in an interview:<br>“There&#39;s a growing consensus among the key analysts in the United States and also in Taiwan that war is not inevitable and the war is not imminent,” Wu said. “And we have been making significant investment in our own defense - not just increasing our military budget, but also engaging serious military reforms, in the sense of asymmetric strategy and asymmetric capability.”<br>That principle now guides Taiwan’s evolving force posture. The May 12 HIMARS test - launching precision-guided rockets into a Pacific exclusion zone - was the first public demonstration of the mobile artillery system since the U.S. delivered the first batch in late 2024. With a range of 300 kilometers, HIMARS provides not only mobility but standoff power, allowing Taiwan’s forces to strike amphibious staging areas, beachheads, and ships from hardened inland positions. Lockheed Martin engineers observed the drills, which were broadcast across Taiwanese news networks as both a military signal and psychological campaign.<br>The live-fire exercise also marked the debut of the Land Sword II, a domestically developed surface-to-air missile system designed to counter diverse aerial threats, including cruise missiles, aircraft, and drones. Land Sword II adds a mobile, all-weather air defense layer to Taiwan’s increasingly dense multi-domain network. By deploying it alongside HIMARS, Taiwan demonstrated its commitment to building overlapping shields - striking at invading forces while protecting its launch platforms from aerial suppression.<br>But these new missile systems are only the tip of the spear.<br>Taiwan’s military has quietly abandoned the vestiges of a Cold War posture centered on fleet battles and long-range missile parity with the mainland. Defense officials now concede that attempts to match Beijing plane-for-plane or ship-for-ship are a dead end. Instead, inspired by the “porcupine” concept outlined by retired U.S. Marines and intelligence officials, Taiwan is remaking itself into a smart, lethal archipelago fortress - one where unmanned drones, dispersed missile cells, and underground fiber-linked command posts neutralize China’s numerical advantage.<br>Wu, who now serves as Secretary-General of Taiwan’s National Security Council, has been one of the doctrine’s most consistent advocates. In his writings and interviews, Wu points to Ukraine’s ability to hold off a vastly superior invader through mobility, deception, and smart munitions. “We are not seeking parity. We are seeking survivability,” he wrote in Foreign Affairs. “And if we survive, we win.”<br>A New Arsenal of Ideas: From Silicon Valley to the Taiwan Strait<br>If Ukraine showed the value of agile, off-the-shelf technologies on the battlefield, Taiwan seems poised to go a step further - by integrating cutting-edge systems developed not by defense contractors, but by Silicon Valley insurgents.<br>Among the most closely watched innovators is Palmer Luckey, the former Oculus founder whose defense firm, Anduril Industries, is quietly revolutionizing battlefield autonomy. Through its Dive Technologies division and flagship Ghost and Bolt drone platforms, Anduril builds AI-guided aerial and underwater drones capable of swarming enemy ships, submarines, and even mines - exactly the kinds of systems Taiwan could deploy along its maritime approaches and chokepoints.<br>Luckey, who visited Japan and South Korea in early 2025 to brief U.S. allies on asymmetric AI warfare, has warned that in a Taiwan invasion scenario, the side with better autonomous targeting and tracking could determine victory before a single human-fired missile is launched.<br>“The PLA is betting big on AI,” he told Business Insider. “If Taiwan and the U.S. don’t match that, we’re done.”<br>Much of this strategy finds intellectual backing in The Boiling Moat, a 2024 strategy volume edited by former U.S. National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger [cự phách trong hệ thống lý luận chống Trung Cộng mà Trump 47 lại gạt qua một bên!]. The book proposes a multi-layered defense of Taiwan that includes hardened ground troops, swarming drones, portable anti-ship missiles, and AI battlefield networking.<br>Pottinger argues that Taiwan must become “the toughest target on earth”- a phrase now common among Taiwanese officers briefing American delegations. Speaking to NPR last year, Pottinger noted that Taiwan’s survival doesn’t rest on matching China’s power, but on “convincing Beijing that the price of conquest will be far too high to bear.”</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
